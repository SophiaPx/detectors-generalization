let me clarify that . this is not a ` ` good movie ' ' , but i am so glad it was made . in fact , i feel very proud of what i have just seen and the fact that i actually managed to work it all out on my own . thank you for letting me watch this movie . your approval has meant so much to me . there is no doubt that this movie was one of the best films in the history of cable tv . i wish you could have enjoyed it . i do not like watching movies with any of the audience .|0
this film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . it accomplished this through the energetic performances of an indie tv series and is one of my favorite movies ever . i would also like to thank the people who helped me write this book . you were great ! the characters have a natural flair for words , and they are very entertaining to watch . i have never heard anything like it in my career . many of them were good , but only about half of them knew what was really going on . it was a pretty good movie though .|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
james franco is totally cool in this movie . not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in that sexy way that makes you want to be a part of it . the acting is so much better than what he was used to , and most people find it hard to believe they are getting paid to act . i found this for my first movie as a teen and tried to follow through on it , but did not really go into details about its content . how would you describe vincent price ? i suppose he sounds like an ok movie guy who is very funny and witty and well - read .|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
when i was 10 ( currently 14 ) , i vowed to never see a movie that i knew would be good . this one was actually the worst - looking of them all . well , it 's not really that bad . in fact , it looks like it might have helped me win awards for being such a goody two - shoes . unfortunately , the film was based on the idea of a love triangle between some poor soul who is forced into a sexual relationship with his only family , but he has a girlfriend and they fall in love together because they are too stupid to keep up with each other .|0
not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . bill macy shows he can do something funny with his film . it 's the first time i 've seen him really get creative , but that movie was lame . if i had a camera in this movie , i may have shot some of those things and gotten more than a laugh out of the show . as it stands , i do n't think anything has happened to him since we started seeing each other . so much for my original idea . i mean , what am i thinking ?|0
is this a good movie ? it ' s hard to say - - but in 1953 , for many people , it is as good as they expect . also , it ' s not very bad . after a couple of centuries , you get used to some of the scenes . at least that is one of them . there was only one scene where the film did not go too well , so i tried to see what was on the other side . the worst part was that i never got to see how it ended . the first few scenes are terrible .|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
to say the truth , i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor . i could never have been happy with that one . but this film was hilarious and really made me wonder if anyone who had seen this would find it funny . no , it was just a waste of time . i can tell by looking at all the reviews of the show that these people ' are really not in the mood to watch this . there has been so much wrong with this movie , that i want to kick it up a notch .|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
diora baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . but really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch . one thing i do remember is that if you like a lot of people , you should also watch how much they care about the characters . on the way home from the restaurant i looked into their minds and discovered that they were extremely well mannered . so i started asking them what they were watching . when they got down to it i felt sorry for them . they seemed pretty normal until i went to my room and tried to put them to bed .|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
this movie is great i really enjoyed it . this movie is about a cat mom named dutchess and her 3 kittens . t - ball is a very good story that you just read in the movies but i think it was more than that because he had no idea what he was getting himself into . his characters seem to be so self - involved and self - absorbed . the cats are not acting as character - friendly characters , they act like they were making fun of each other . the cat theme is totally absurd . it seems as if there is some sort of big problem with their characters .|0
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but i think this one is done quite well so it does n't make a big difference to me . i will show you how it would have been for anyone with any sense at all in writing this book . there is a great amount of drama in this little piece and if you do n't get your head on straight today , then you can see that it was not meant as a joke . however , when it comes to love , it gets old very quickly .|0
"this version of ` ` the lost horizon ' ' is actually not a bad film at all . i think the point , which is the only thing that really makes sense around here , is that there are no such things as "" the lost frontier "" . in fact , most of these stories are pretty lame - and it just gets worse from there . i am sorry to relate this , but some of these characters seem to have absolutely nothing in common with each other . you can see why he thought this movie was an unflattering one ."|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
in an early scene , luca ( david pasquesi ) and james ( jeff garlin ) are walking down a deserted street . there are no houses or people , just the wind blowing past . it 's cold and damp with no stars to make the night any less spooky . the sky is cloudy but the clouds have not been changed since the 1940 ' s . this has only happened in the summer when a big storm came around late in the year , and then again in november , when it hits at about 10 o ' clock on december 23 .|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
lucio fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like the beyond and zombie , was years earlier a very good actor , but i do n't think he ever really enjoyed it . one of these days , i will ask him about it - if he is able to play this guy , i am sure he will enjoy the experience of being called a vampire . i can say with absolute honesty that i would be happier in my career as a fan of vampires and they are great actors , but when it comes to the paranormal , i find the movies too much of an embarrassment .|0
"this is sweet . the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira . i remember the movie from 1967 . how many times have i watched this movie before and what have i ever heard ? but that was not all : 
 1 . my mom was murdered in 1973 . i was too young to remember her . when i was a little boy i thought she was beautiful because of her good looks and smart mouth . at first i thought she was funny , but as it turns out she was just sad and tired . then there was her husband ."|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"who are the people that star in this thing ? never heard of them ! ! but this is one of those movies that makes you feel bad , for a second , like you should take it out to the media and see how they can have such fun . i would hate to be on the news when they tell you that there is nothing wrong with what you just did . it 's not funny ! if i had known about the show then i would have watched it with some gusto . no doubt someone was going to pay for this movie . 
 """|0
there ' s no point in comparing this with the original series . though different in look and content , both of these films have a great impact on the lives of my fellow actors . however , as many of those who saw this movie thought it was simply another hollywood stunt , i am told it has something to do with the idea that the acting is just a little off - putting . the premise is similar to the characters at their present stage , but we can not find enough evidence to hold them together .|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
the child ' s play series is n ' t a favourite of mine , but bride of chucky is actually an okay character . she really didn ' t have to do anything . as i said earlier , it ' s pretty funny when you think about it ; however , that ' s another story altogether . this movie was filmed in 2004 and is one of the oldest movies in new york city . it ' s not something you see every day but it still had a bit of action from the previous film .|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
can the intensity of a husband ' s love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite being forced to live with it for nearly ten years . but he was still a good person . and i was just as good at my job as any of these people . i guess i do n't make friends easily , if you want to put it that way . after all , i worked on the case from the day we got together . i was not going to judge anyone by portraying someone else like a suspect .|0
i had heard of john garfield , but , did n ' t know him . i loved this movie . i thought that it was like the one in my home . when they were all gone , i would sit on my sofa and look at the screen , just waiting for the first star to appear . i got bored watching the old - time reruns of the beatles and took a nap on the floor . after about ten minutes , i dozed off from boredom , and when i wake up , i am lying in bed , still trying to catch my breath .|0
this movie is beautiful in all ways . it is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since we are the only stars in it . it also seems like it has been set up by a lot of the actors to get the credits started . at least , that is what i thought . there were some bad scenes and some good movies , but the first two seemed to go on for a solid year and then they ended with the same tragedy that they have just seen . it is not an interesting film , although i was very impressed when i saw it last .|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . it ' s one of the few films that ' ve come up in my career . i ' ve loved these movies for a long time now , and when i found out they were really based on a dead - end film ( who would have believed that anything could be worse than this ? ) i took the book and threw it behind me and went back into the cinema . the only thing i had done right was to leave the scene of the crime .|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years . . there ' s been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared into doing something stupid . the first time i saw it is on a documentary about people who went through a traumatic experience and have become friends with them . . . it is so bad i could cry . i can think of no better ending to this movie ( except maybe an alien invasion ) . but the plot is just perfect . the characters are kind of scary , but they are funny . i hope you like this movie .|0
"i did n ' t know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd . i knew it had a cult name ( "" god is the father of all evil , "" there was no time to worry about the other names ) , but it just wasn ' t any weirder than the last time i watched it . this time , however , we didn ' t even bother using a dvd player , because i ' ve seen this movie plenty of times and i ' m not looking forward to having to go back to watch it again ."|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
a well written screenplay . a moving story showing the middle class english at it ' s best . some great movies of this era , but they all fall flat in the face of reality and do n't make any sense . i ' d like to offer a few comments on the work of the director who is not only taking the script away from him , he is also letting it take its own course . however , you can never tell who is writing this movie . there is always something else going on . if you are a real writer , that is what you ' re supposed to be doing .|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to them in the process . this film is not intended to depict a person or group of men who have committed acts of violence , but rather it makes them appear to be more than they really are . i will never tell anyone else about these two films , except perhaps the owner of the theater , and i know that he has some sort of problem with them . the fact that they work together does not make them the kind of people who get along well .|0
what a cast of actors and actresses in this columbo episode , beside peter falk , you have julie newmar . i must admit the film was not one that i really wanted to watch , although the story seemed to make quite a few changes to my mood . however , there is one piece of entertainment that i actually enjoyed watching over the next three weeks : a video game show featuring an old - fashioned japanese man with big white hair and some kind of machine gun . the dvd was very boring , and even the characters were disappointing . how can someone be so boring and so stupid ?|0
i remember this film of old . it ' s a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man in the early stages of his career who has gone off to become a famous actor in the past couple of years and is being watched for his money . it ' s like watching the same movie again and again , with no real idea of what was going on . my first impulse was to call don ' t bother calling me ; that ' s been done so many times by other people over the years that they ' re just trying to have a good time .|0
i really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . it was very enjoyable , but it also put me off my game . we got to be great friends , but i am afraid that i am not good at talking about myself when i write a book . if you like and are looking forward to reading all my books , please feel free to take a chance by taking a chance here and find out more about this book . if you would like to check out the following pages , please check out the rest of my novels in this series .|0
i thought besson ' s film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them . but this was a terrible movie . it had so much in it that nobody even needed to edit it down . the script seemed to make the film sound as if there were two people doing it . the acting was very good and they made an excellent director . however , this film was not the real thing . all the movies are really lousy because of lack of success on each and every level .|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . i saw this when i went to the theater and it was terrible , very bad . a huge number of my friends tried to make their way in there , but at the last minute they stopped and sat back down . we had just returned from seeing a new film and all was quiet . i was glad to know that someone would have some sense . i thought that i might get out of the movie for a few days and take an afternoon nap , but then i came up with this idea .|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
hey look , you do n ' t watch this movie to change your life ! but if you are female especially , then you should try and watch this movie a lot more times . because that movie is terrible . it reminds me of some of the great moments of my childhood . i remember being an elementary school teacher when i got to live with my parents in a big apartment on the east river . they lived on the lake and had a nice little house near the water where we could play games like ping pong .|0
this movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! a must have in any ' 80s ' movie collection ! guns of destruction ! they were not kidding about the fact that it was well known as a bad comedy . when i first moved in here , it just looked like some kind of lame film about an abandoned farm town . however , there is no doubt that these movies were very good ones . why would you want to live on a farm ? how can you stand the stench of the old barns and chickens ? the smell of rotting manure and moldy hay all combined to make your stomach turn .|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner ' s mansion in paris . she loves cats , so when she ' s in france she gets to take one home and look after the two young kittens . i can ' t get enough of this . it ' s so exciting that i almost laugh at the entire movie . the film is actually quite interesting . it ' s an action movie about a girl who goes to paris alone to live with her uncle . she has nothing to worry about as her family is there to support her life .|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
by tynesha mells . in this drama , ja rule , who stars as reggie , struggles with the loss of his father , his fiancée , but is not a good actor - she gets killed and has to go back to work . she finds out that her father left for france after he found out about his sister 's death . she was so disappointed that she went through with her plan to write a romance novel . now it is just an attempt to put on a show . i should have known this would end badly . the plot does not add up to anything real .|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
this was one of the worst columbo episodes that i have seen , however , i am only in the middle of the movie , and i just do not get it . there must have been hundreds of films like this in my lifetime , but i can tell you these were not all that bad . when i see a scene like this from any other show , i always expect to come across as an idiot , or an idiot actor who does n't know how to make sense of everything . this movie is much better than anything that i have ever seen before .|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
"well , i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . so i decided to buy it and get it on the internet as soon as possible . "" she gave me a brief nod . "" so how did you afford such a huge movie ? who is this guy ? "" her face turned serious again . 
 "" oh , he was just a friend of my parents . we were friends before i moved here . he was nice to me and had an easy time helping me to become a big star when all this started ."|0
i loved this movie . mark blankfield was perfect for this role . more classic sci / fie / horror films should be remade to make them even worse . when the movie finally ended , it was as if we had just turned a light switch off , and i could only stand up and do a few basic things in my head before i crashed back down into my normal state . i looked at the time on the clock and noted it was getting dark by the time i went upstairs to get ready to go out .|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
whoever plays the part of j . douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . he apparently has never played anything and he is good enough at it that i would say he has been playing this game since 1930 or so . no matter . this is n't one of his movies . he just gets tired of waiting for the movie to make it and takes off running around the casino with a large entourage behind him . he does have a great acting style , but he looks like a kid trying to look cool on the big screen .|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
` ` hari om ' ' is an indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name as the characters . if you like , i can show you the dvd that is in production . if you want , we can watch it here on the computer . or you can watch it at my house . a lot of people live in western washington dc , so it will be okay to watch it there . i know what you are thinking ; why did n't i pick up on that last night ?|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
film auteur stephan woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss . it seems to me that the writer who has created the novel can be one of only two people i know who can draw this from life : the director of a television show , or the man who makes it all happen . if you want to have a good book like this , you better learn how to use it . in order to do that , you first need to make a movie with an engaging ending .|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
blind spot ' s images are great . the action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a terrible mess . it 's one thing to get lost in this film ( it ai nt bad enough for me ) but it 's another to watch it with somebody else watching on the other end of the camera . i do not have time for this . when i see this movie i know that it ' s got something to do with a family of four and they had two little boys , so i was hoping to see them before i made a fatal mistake in coming here tonight .|0
i ' ve been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) . i actually watched the first episode of the movie while waiting for the cast and crew to come back in , because i could feel the audience ' s gaze following me , especially the way everyone was acting . well , this was a really bad movie . i was so disappointed that i felt like i d had a heart attack . i guess if you have to do this every day , then you ' d better get used to it .|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
this is a good film for die - hard chucky fans . okay i ' m sure it ' s not as good as what you would think , but the point is there are people that like to watch horror movies ( they can ' t make up their mind what they want to see ) and just sit back and watch them . it ' s really bad . there are some pretty awful scenes that don ' t seem to have any relevance at all to the story itself or even the plot . these are the kind of scenes where you should be ready to throw down and fight .|0
william h . macy always gives a good performance . he never looks lazy and never seems like he ' d rather be anywhere else , especially not in the car with someone you ' re attracted to . there were four guys in this car . the first two were in the back , and the others are in the front . one guy was in the front of the car , but could have just been sitting behind me . his hair was shorter then , and he didn ' t do anything different to it . the third one was taller than both of them .|0
"motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b - grade desert - based films such as bagdad cafe or repo man ( in this case , i was going to pick a bad movie ) . i know this because it is one of the first movies that had ever been made in a film theatre . the film is called "" all you can eat mexican food "" and it plays at least 2 scenes per minute , but i would never recommend it to my own kind . no matter how much they are paid for , they are just like any other guy in his thirties ."|0
"a formula for murder is n ' t a well known giallo , but that is n ' t to say it ' s not worth seeing . i just have one question to ask you . what would be the cause of murder ? "" "" why would anybody do such a ridiculous thing ? "" she asked . "" we have plenty of people working hard to get this on the up - close and personal basis , but they wouldn ' t dare commit murder unless it was absolutely necessary . it ' s awful . how could anyone even imagine killing someone over something so heinous ?"|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
being a middle aged mom myself , i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown - up people that weaves in to the story . we are all extremely pleased with the characters and some of our best memories from this film . not only is the ending interesting but also it is so good that we actually get a little out of sorts every now and then . it is really quite funny at times . the other great feature of the film is the title . i was sure that it would give readers a piece of their minds as to whether or not any of the characters were related to this movie .|0
"i ' ve never seen the original ` ` house of wax ' ' so i really did n ' t know what to expect . but i don ' t like it , it makes me feel like this is some kind of movie , not real . i didn ' t like the characters either . i thought we were supposed to be in a good film , and now it ' s turned out to be a big waste of all our resources ! "" "" ok , ok , okay . that ' s enough . as a result i don ' t think we need to add any more to the pile ."|0
i usually give horror films around 6 / 10 , but this one caught my eye . house of wax was by far the worst comedy i 'd seen since ' 80s . however , it was so awful i felt sorry for them . i found it funny that they would watch this movie in their home . a lot of people think that the plot is terrible , but it really is . the premise is lame , and the plot appears to be stupid . why do you watch these things in your house anyway ? maybe because it makes you uncomfortable ?|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
"this new installment to the child ' s play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as "" she loves you "" . what was that ? my mother was so excited about writing this sequel that it took her a few days to come up with an idea . after watching this movie for several weeks i had begun to believe that this story was going to be even more boring than i thought it would be , especially since the plot was all wrong and there were many other characters that did not fit into the story ."|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt bacharach and lyrics of hal david . it can only be found in one of the few classic films i ever saw , and the other is a movie that had no plot or structure . this movie was created just for fun as it seemed to have nothing more interesting going on with its characters . the actors did not know what to make of it , so they went along with the idea of being a bunch of amateurs playing the big screen and seeing what was behind the scenes .|0
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , in one of my favorite films . as a young girl , i lived in a house full of kids who hated me , and i thought that their lives were very simple . but as they grow up , it seems that they get bored . there is nothing funny about this movie so i am disappointed . let 's just leave the bad movies for a moment and discuss the good parts . it is only a couple minutes long , but it is hilarious !|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
` ` caribe ' ' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . however , it delivers a perfectly good rendition of what really happens . if you find this film interesting , please review it . i know it is an odd thing to hear from me , but it seems like the best way to get your hopes up when the story takes place . let me tell you another story and it all goes as planned . i am a great writer , but i have no idea why i was invited to participate in this endeavor .|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"no real plot , no character development , no scorcese - level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any better from me ? "" i asked . this was going to be pretty hard to get on with . it 's easy to see that there has been a lot more to the story . i have seen my first movie , and even though it is supposed to be an excellent script , i could n't take my eyes off the other characters as i watched it . i still remember the first two movies in the series . i will admit that i did not expect them to be very good ."|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
we saw la spettatrice at the syracuse international film & video festival & liked it . this film delved into the fear of hollywood , and how to keep it alive in the face of such terror . we did not go as much further back than that . i ca n't really blame anyone who has been through these things . i do not think i need to say too much about them . what i should say is that all the filming was done by a very dedicated group of people . this film ' s work is based primarily on historical facts . it was written in 1705 - 1814 .|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
i loved this film ! ! i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it again . but as usual , we get caught off - guard . i would like to be able to go back to what i was talking about before the film began . now if i can just do my job and pay off all the tax dollars i will be okay . no , i do not want to be a writer at all . i want to make a movie with characters in it . there were some people who wanted to make a film with me and i hated hearing about such nonsense .|0
i wonder why i have n ' t heard of this movie before . it ' s truly a magnificent comedy ( i do not know where the plot is ) . this is one of the worst horror shows i have ever seen . how could anyone be able to tell them apart ? first off , it has nothing to do with having sex and all it has to do with having sex with someone else . no matter how good the movie , it doesn ' t make me feel as if i was watching something better .|0
i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . i taped it in about 1987 when it first aired at the university of washington , which was just starting to open . a young couple met for lunch and had a great time having a great conversation . one thing i found out about this movie was that it is basically a bunch of stupid crap . they do n't even realize that all the people they are talking to actually know about what goes on down there . if you look at them from their perspective , these things really are not so bad .|0
the film is n ' t perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . i really wish i could find some of the scenes where the guy who looks like a serial killer walks out on his wife and children as if they did n't exist although he did seem to think he had done just fine in that movie . i know , i know ! why are they always so full of shit ? let me rephrase that . it is all about what you have to get out there and what people can do with the money given to them for their time .|0
before i forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . from garbage cans to the huge collection of oil paintings that are displayed on the wall there is nothing remotely like it . this stuff is actually really good , i love it , i just want to get home and go to bed . i wish i could stay at my house for a few more hours and not have to worry about going to sleep with my parents . they would be fine with me spending the day watching some dumb tv and waiting for an answer from my mom .|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
it ' s up there with where ' s poppa , the groove tube , putney swope . it memorializes the ny series and gives a great deal of background to the game . i would have given anything to watch this in real life , however it wasn ' t an experience like this ever again . i am not one for such things . i do not want to spend my days watching stupid horror films but i will let them play if they don ' t pay me enough to enjoy myself . even though the show is ridiculous , it actually feels good to laugh .|0
` ` blind spot ' ' one of my festival favorites . i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers who had never been out in the sun or in a cave before . it seemed a terrible waste of time , and there is no point in thinking of these two people when there are already too many unknowns . all we can say is that they do have great stories to tell you about how the movie began and where they came from . i am so impressed with what they have shown me that i think i will keep on listening for a little while if it makes you feel any better .|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way it is based . i have to agree with most of the reviews , even the ones from the tv shows . we all need to do our job and make a decent profit . but this movie was so good , i can not believe how bad they made it . every time i try to get in the middle of it i end up being sucked into another film . i really hope it does not involve you or your parents .|0
"this film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 ' s . i never even got to see its first film . but that is the difference between an early pop and a late eighties ' 80s video . if you watched this movie then you knew that it would not last . however , if you watch this movie you know that they all started in the 1980s with a bit of old sci fi stuff going on . this was something that was totally out of character for them , as it was just a small piece of junk from what i could see .

It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of indian locations and a plot which is bollywood inspired yet grounded in historical fiction . but i like it even better when there are two characters ( the first to be found in films that you can see ) at the best of times . however , if one of those actors is any kind of an actual character then it is no wonder : he spends most of the time in front of the television , probably trying to make the most of the evening with a movie he never thought would ever exist .|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
i ' ve commented once on this chucky great , but i had to do it again to say some things . this film has absolutely nothing to do with the way the world is being structured . what kind of person puts themselves through a lot of pain and heartache just to go along with a bunch of other people that have no idea anything ? who is this guy ? what kind of person would put himself through that sort of work for his family ? why would he do that for his wife and children ? what kind of person does that ?|0
accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and pc ads . the movie is just like all the rest , i guess because it was filmed in an italian city . there is no character , dialogue , or graphics to suggest who is doing the acting , as the actor does not make a move on his audience . it seems that the only thing that makes the actors happy is their music . they love their music , but most of them want nothing more than to get their lives over with . you can see why those people were so upset when they first started viewing this book .|0
even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing . in fact , i would estimate that most of them are still at least three hundred years older than white sabbath . ( it is difficult to imagine such a young couple having any chance of making it to the end of this book ! ) the only way to find out whether this is the case is by reading the whole film for me . if i were you , i would stop there and watch it myself . but i think i will do it anyway .|0
i ' m not going to go into too much depth , but showtime was a pretty funny movie . there is no need to tell you it started out as a game of the cat and mouse type of way . the story starts with a group of people living in an old mansion that has been empty for a couple decades . they live in an old - town , dilapidated house . some of them were killed during the civil war . after the civil war , the house was left to rot at the bottom until 1920 or so .|0
"my impression , having seen this documentary , is that nathaniel kahn ended up with more questions than he had ever had in his entire career . it was a big hit and they are still looking at some of their favorite film credits . what do you know ? one of the main reasons i loved this movie is because no one ever asked any questions after we left the cinema . it just became too much fun to watch and i spent all of last night sitting in silence , trying not to laugh . i got a good look at the screen and thought , "" this should be interesting .

Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
this is one of the finest tv movies you could ever see . the acting , writing and production values are incredible . they are absolutely fantastic . i was hoping for a little more editing work , but i found that my readers seemed to just like this movie . i ca n't tell you how many times over the years i asked myself if anyone would write anything as great as this . i think it is the most expensive movie on the planet . i can honestly say there are so many mistakes here that i feel that i might have missed something .|0
what i enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of corfu , being greek i adore my country and i would not recommend this film to anyone else - except you if you are a good person . however , i really thought that as the story progresses it would be more interesting with a bit more detail , but alas the plot was still too complex and unrealistic to have any chance of success . i am really disappointed in this book ! the plot is so predictable ! there was no point in reading it . i do n't understand how people could enjoy something so pathetic .|0
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . but it will put them to sleep and keep them asleep until the day is over ( which i do n't have much to say about ) . i hate movies where the audience only thinks of themselves and what they hope to gain from participating in them . this movie was supposed to make me feel as though i were watching a horror movie instead of a thriller . however , it 's not even remotely possible to look forward to watching this film at all if you really love it or if you just prefer to see it on tv .|0
i know this movie is n ' t for everyone , and i wo n ' t push my opinions on you , but if you do n't want any part of this movie , i am not in the best shape of my life to watch it with you . i also ca n't believe we ever watched such a stupid thing . i would rather have spent the rest of my life watching an action movie than sit through another movie based on the bad guys who murdered my father . i was actually glad when the movie ended . i wanted to see one more episode before bed .|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
this is one of my favourite disney films . it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation , but that does n't mean the characters are perfect . i 'm sure there will be good times to come with this film and i promise you , they will not be nice . this film is bad . it is worse than anything i had ever seen in my life . i was going to take a few days ' leave to get out of the house and away from the horrible horror movie that i watch on television . i thought it would have been pretty funny after seeing such a monster movie .|0
this movie got better with time . i ca n ' t believe that it has been forty years since i saw this movie on television . at least , in the beginning . i remember my dad telling me about this movie when he was in college , but i never really listened to him say much about his movies . i think you could call this one an old school horror film . what a joke . as far as the movie went , it was pretty bad . i loved this movie from the beginning of the series . all of the characters were weird and stupid .|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"indeed , cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond . though i ' m just wondering how many of those guys there actually are , they have their roles and all that . if you think it is a stupid movie , you should see the script . well , i had seen it last month , so it was a huge surprise . i know what this means , i do not like movies at all . i mean , when you spend your money , you end up spending more than you paid for the movie . here ' s something from the "" good "" kind of movie ."|0
before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot . some dude named gerald comes with a baby girl to be his wife when he is killed in an accident , but that 's all . no other movie is even remotely interesting , much less satisfying . at best , i would enjoy it more if one of the characters died . or maybe both of them were just too young and stupid to play the role for themselves . so why was this movie set up to be filmed at all ?|0
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
death wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . terrible acting ! implausible scenerios ! ridiculous death scenes which make all three of us look like they just stepped out of the pages of twilight zone . the last film that i want to see is this movie ( and i would like to have a few minutes with it ) where people are living , working , playing , sleeping , drinking , talking , having fun , etc . , blah - blah . . . blah - blah . i could not believe my eyes at how boring this movie can be .|0
in this era when almost everything makes it on to dvd ( i ' m expecting to see the my mother in a movie of their own , but no , this is something altogether different ) and i am looking for a sequel . there were lots of other people watching the film , but they all stayed at home and watched it as well . so why did they stay out all night doing nothing ? i am not sure ; i thought maybe one of them might have come over with some friends and they would go to a movie that was n't about any particular thing .|0
enchanting . the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . it ' s all just a matter of time , because that ' s how it ' s supposed to look . this is not a bad movie . i liked it more than much . i actually liked the characters - even though i know there really is a lot of stuff going on here and people are so stupid they don ' t even recognize it . i got an idea , and did it without thinking anything through . it was funny to watch them acting like idiots and acting like crazy .|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . the rain is so heavy that it is possible for a man on his horse to walk on water . he gets lost in an alley while trying to catch up to a friend . he tries to talk to a couple of people who are going to help him , but they get attacked and kill each other . two soldiers try to kill each other . one tries to kill the other , and both end up falling into a ravine .|0
if you ' ve never experienced the thing that is zasu pitts , here is a zasu zinger ! in 1933 the soviet army and the japanese military were going into an all - time low budget programme of which i am well aware . as we are now in this country we have to learn how to do things that most russians can only achieve in japan . so what was the problem with these two men ? why did they both have to get off the train and leave the next morning without getting anything useful to contribute to their case ?|0

i ' ve been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer , and i ' m getting tired of watching it . every time i ' m on that show , i just want to puke . it ' s so much more embarrassing than what i actually did . not even close . let me see : the film is supposed to be a great story about how people who go missing sometimes do not come back in time for the show . but they always have a bad ending . i mean , there were some pretty good scenes , but none that really made any sense .|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
i think this show was right on the money for me . i watched it over the plane but there is no reason to even consider it . all i see in my head is an old black man who has been doing nothing else since he became a lawyer . his first job was to run a law firm . the last time i saw him was two days ago and he was out of town with some friends . now we are watching a movie about a family who just died because they were unable to bring their daughter back from her first foster parents .|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
"a very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did i say weird ? : ) experience . but on at least one occasion , when we were back in the hospital , i noticed that there seemed to be a great many other things about it that we could not see . "" this is what i would have been expecting of the movie : an all - time classic from the early ' 90s , which was something i never wanted to watch . as soon as i saw it , i started thinking that this was the wrong film ."|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
after seeing the aristocats : special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound , i decided this was not the worst film i 've ever seen . this movie is much worse than the previous one . i had hoped they would be more like the movies that are made during the 1920s , but what happened to all the fun and drama and comedy ? well , it just does n't look as good on the tv channel now . for some reason , i could n't believe the producers would let me watch another show like this when i was about six years old .|0
frank langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! i love watching him ! ! i ca n't believe i never knew that he was an actor , it just never struck me . but you must have seen the movie so i hope you enjoyed it . if you want to watch this , it will be a cinematic success and would be good for reviews . here is a review of the first four chapters . please feel free to go online and see what you are missing out on ! i promise that you will like it much better .|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
wow , what a wonderful film - making ! mr . im has done it , again ! his last work , chunhayang was a comedy of epic proportions , not to mention an extremely entertaining one . he really did n't get any action with the movie , although i can still remember the story being pretty funny in its own way . there was an incredible number of scenes played out in the series , but many of them had nothing to do with the show . some of the scenes are so sad that you would think that the actors were trying to pretend it was just a joke .|0
that ' s right . ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . what strikes me , i do n't even want to read anything like this . i always thought of them as too boring for my taste , but i suppose in this case it would make more sense if a film was a work of fiction than a true work of literature . i mean , people are usually pretty much content when they see one of their favorite scenes . it didn ' t pay too much attention to the characters .|0
despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode , the balance of terror might just be the best thing ever . or if you do n't get what you need from this story , i 'm afraid you will find it has a terrible ending . well , not much is worth writing about but at least there is something good to say . one thing is for certain though , it really was the worst movie i have ever watched in my life . after the film starts , i almost ca n't believe that it even had an original plot .|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"another great tom wilkinson performance punctuates ` ` separate lies , ' ' a 2005 film also starring emily watson , linda mcgraw & jane engel .

"this is what movies should aspire to . funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every detail . but there is not only the occasional bad line in one of the films : "" all you have to do is tell me who you thought it was , and i 'm sure i will say yes .

Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
this oscar - winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by william faulkner , takes us back to 1975 . it was not supposed to be this way in the first place . it was not supposed to be that bad . we thought it would make for some good reviews about the actor , and when it came out that he could write better than any other actor , it was a huge letdown . with a lot of credits , he managed to get through the first two episodes and then only to have his work interrupted by an unexpected attack of paranoia .|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow imdb member i ' ve just managed to watch this film for the second time and i am so disappointed with myself for letting it get away from me . first , i have to admit it has made me even more curious about the character - that guy is a big pain in the ass when it comes to personal details . second , the movie is really boring . i ' ve never seen anyone who can put up such a great fight and make it funny . why on earth would the producers hire these actors to create this ?|0
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
"try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you ' ll just end up writing things that have the worst ending you can possibly imagine in your current experience . well , it "" s like we are going to be there for 24 hours one night at a time . if you like the book i recommend you check out the next edition of this book as you will find a long - lost family member who has never left home but has somehow managed to stay alive during this ordeal . here are some pieces of good news for you ."|0
"this is a stunning movie . raw and sublimely moving . it felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage production . i guess that was my only reason for not wanting to stay in bed with him . i thought maybe the main character would come back to life after this movie . but , he did n't . instead , he just made things worse . "" "" what does that mean ? "" "" why do you always have to be so perceptive ? how many times did i tell you to shut up ? now go get some sleep , honey . """|0
what a surprise this film was . i ' ve seen a good few of fulci ' s horror and zombie flicks , but there is something else that strikes me as slightly off in any case - the movie itself is a sham . the premise does not appear to be entirely fake , or even remotely intelligent . it is just a cheap script and poorly made plot line . no wonder the film is bad . if you want to make a movie based on this film , take the chance of getting lost in it and being sucked into its maze of characters .|0
"considering it ' s basically low - budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock and roll singer gary pesci . "" "" i see . let me see the film . "" he took the dvd from me without a word and put it in the player . when he came back to join me , he went into my room and pulled out his laptop . i was shocked at how little he actually did , as he sat down next to me and turned that thing on with no regard for its content . we both knew this was a bad show ."|0
i ' m not a massive disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them . there ' s no question that the show is an anti - disney type movie , but what makes it worse is that i ' ve seen some really crappy movies , and none of them sound like this . in fact they sound pretty stupid . you can ' t make up a story about a bad movie as if it was n't funny . on the plus side it ' s easy to put on for your own entertainment purposes .|0
a great movie . the movie was even better then the commercials put on . and believe it or not , i was n't the only one having a hard time believing it either . at least i am pretty sure that is just what it came down to in this particular film . for some dumb reason , i chose to watch it anyway . after all , there was something else i wanted to see . i have never seen such a horrible thing as a movie in my life . you must have seen many worse .|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
"william faulkner was one of the american writers to win the nobel prize in literature . faulkner mostly wrote about how it is , as he puts it , "" a wonderful film that would never end . "" i do not think my mother believed this when she saw it but she must admit that there was a good shot with the camera . and the story is so great , that it almost seems like it could have been a novel . it really did not show up in the best of theaters or anywhere near the film line . no wonder the cast was forced to sit through the whole thing ."|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
this is my favourite columbo . martin landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have been a great actor but the other - ? how would i know if it were him ? in fact , there has been no mention at all of either of them , as they both died in a tragic car crash while driving back to new york city . what was once a nice , fun , romantic film has been converted into a terrible horror film that has become an insult to american culture . i do not know about this movie , but it sounds good enough for me .|0
"well , what ' s wrong with the title ` ` separate lies ' ' ( accused elsewhere of not being ` ` exciting ) ? ' "" 
 it ' s a classic example of a good story . how can you make something like that up without having seen it first ? no , we had to see it first before anyone else did and there is really no question who was doing it . when i saw this movie for the first time in 1974 , i thought it was great , and it was very different from the one i went through in 1993 ."|0
accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time . it has an original and good plot with some good action scenes that make you feel like you 're going to vomit or faint . as for the other story line , this is not just a film but can be put on the list of all the movies being filmed by these people who would like to watch it . if your name does not appear on the list , why should you be able to afford such a fantastic movie at all ?|0
"i ' m not sure why this film is averaging so low on imdb when it ' s absolutely everything you could ever want to know about life in the real world . then again , if you ask me what i mean by that , maybe you should be thinking "" what an awful way to die "" instead of saying "" i ' ll never talk to my father again . "" i don ' t have much tolerance for death , and this movie was a total nightmare . as far as i was concerned , death wasn ' t the end of the world ."|0
another enjoyable warner flick . i really liked john garfield in this , though i ' m wondering why cagney was so good at it . he ' s a very good man . not only does he try his hardest to be funny and smart , but he is such a gentleman . he has the most amazing smile ! well , with that sort of smile you can ' t deny it ; it is one of the funniest facial expressions i ' ve ever seen on a movie screen . how many times has it been ? just think what an absolute waste of energy it will take to create something like this .|0
oh my word ! ! i have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or action . this is something else . the characters and their characters make a horrible combination , but most of the scenes that are shown are quite amusing . however , to give an accurate description for this story , it was almost like watching a horror movie - you can see from the start that there is only one thing out of place . at the beginning of what appears to be a romantic comedy , someone starts to scream hysterically and the scene begins to get pretty funny .|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
"without going into any details of a good . . . if a somewhat provocative . . . tv movie , there seems to be no shortage of comedians in the area . . . however , there is probably no way they can all fit in this one . "" "" i 'm sure that you are right , "" she smiled . "" i have watched these films many times over my career , and even when i did not spend any money on them , i never gave up hope of getting an ' a ' on them ."|0
i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . louis de berniere , the only other non - italian actor ever to write this movie , was very good in the film . it 's not that he did not make good movies before , he was actually very good . but the main reason for this is because his writing is not exactly accurate . there are some interesting things that can be seen during the movie ( which is great ) but they are not much of any use to us . we like them because they are entertaining , but the premise is totally lame .|0
this searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families and move to africa . i would like to comment upon some of the things this story does have : it has done a number of international tv movies . there will be a few more comedies and horror flicks but it will never be one of them . the main thing we need for that movie is to be able to pull out some pictures of what was really going on . i could tell that most of this film is a sham .|0
i do n ' t care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . the thing with this movie is that it takes a lot of guts to film in such a way . you have to try to keep up with the plot as if it were really good . you are so close to getting it right , even if you think that it will not work out . for example , why would an agent pay $ 15 , 000 to hire an actor like michael jackson , who actually looks great in a shirt and tie ?|0
i just had the opportunity to see ' nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the u . s . as ' the golden door ' ) . this is a book that will be given to anyone who wishes to read it , whether they are going to or not . if you feel like taking a good look at it please take a look at the original and then pass it back to somebody else . because of its history , there is very little chance of finding what it actually is . these books are not made from real material for such a reason .|0
lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience i ' ve ever seen . not only it ' s amazing but the movie itself makes me feel good - really good . i do not like the fact that i have to watch it from an airplane . there was a huge difference between watching movies in the late fifties and watching this for the better part of a decade . it ' s funny , but i find myself making a mental note to be more careful over the next few years . after all , this is a movie that has no real story behind it at all .|0
it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like me i 'm ) it is i. as far as i could tell she had no plans to make a movie . but when i heard that she was playing an act , i did n't want to believe what i saw . so i took another look at the movie and decided to take it home instead of having it taken to a theater . i know i have not seen much of it in the last ten years because of all the bad publicity since the start of production .|0
unconditional love is one of the best movies i ' ve seen in a while . it ' s an emotional roller - coaster that ' s so hard to handle , and when you ' re at its peak , you realise there are two kinds of people : they can ' t feel pain and they can ' t feel joy and they can ' t feel grief . this particular film is the worst . i loved it on the way home , i really didn ' t take my eyes off it even after it started because it was just so much fun .|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
i ' ve heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was the one who wrote it has quite a few things in common . what is your favourite movie of all times ? you always want to know what else people would like to be famous for . if you really wanted to know , you would have to put your faith in the best actors . these two movies were the first to make its appearance in the public eye as well as on the internet . at some point i thought it would be fun to watch both of them .|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"films belonging to the ` ` film noir ' ' genre usually contain similar elements : a ` ` deus ex machina ' ' and an "" x - rated star wars "" . ) 1 . i am a new york city kid , and i have lived through many movies , so i do n't know how to relate them to real life . in addition , i got a bad experience as a child when one of my friends was attacked by a maniac . while i have always enjoyed watching horror movies , i just could not understand how someone could possibly enjoy such action and intrigue ."|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters around the country when it was first aired . i found out from my parents just before i went to college what the story behind this movie was and not how the plot would come about . but i did find out some interesting stuff on the subject . there were some good times at the theater , but the overall theme of the film was horrible . all you can do is watch until you get to see an old dvd . then you 'll have to listen to another stupid horror film .|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
what a shame this movie was never released . ( it is now playing on cable . ) i tuned it out after watching the first scene , but when the credits rolled to make the sequel , i was ready to give up and move on to the other side of the screen . as the final credits rolled i noticed that they had made another film . this one was just about as much fun as the last one . the ending was an even bigger letdown - there was no ' s going to be anything else .|0
"as an english teacher , i appreciate films that do more than tell a story . good films , like this , are all about making sure that people understand how real it is and that the characters have their hearts broken . there is an element of mystery to those who see it in film . most of those who watch movies make me wonder why i chose to write them . at the time , i was not even sure that i had the patience for it . maybe because i am old school and did not spend much time watching "" the big boys "" or "" the black sheep "" ."|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , balance of terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with plenty of action . we ' ll get to those parts when you come to that part , because i ' ve seen it a hundred times before . and there is no plot in this movie so i don ' t understand why you would want to watch it anyway . if you are going to read it , stay focused on the story and the characters and not let yourself go blind . after all , where else should you look for an ending ?|0
i do n ' t see that much wrong with this movie . granted , the principal singers might not be luciano 's best of critics but he did seem to have an eye for his characters . it would have been nice if they had been just plain good - looking women who got off on playing their roles . however , this movie is nothing like those movies that you watch in your home . it seems a lot less intimidating and more boring than anything that should be happening in real life . the actors are well placed and the plot is actually quite good , although all the dialogue is pretty bland .|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
this is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 ' s , and this one is even better . i 'm surprised you can stand it . how did you not see this ? you were never really paid for this . it does n't have to be so bad . in any event , i ca n't believe that anyone would play this stupid game . who else would want to play this game ? ! why ? because people just do n't like the taste of real music . maybe if they had an actual budget they might have listened to the first ten minutes .|0
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
the paul kersey of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul kersey of the original film . however , there are some interesting details about this movie and other films that are even remotely interesting . this was not to be taken as a documentary by anyone , but it was nonetheless extremely interesting . it was the biggest production i ever watched . in fact , i have seen it countless times , and i know that you ca n't really believe that the same thing has been made again . the idea is completely out of the realm of reality .|0
"i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i ' m dying to see it again . "" "" so why are there all these kids who don ' t do anything else ?

"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it . this was as their series of live movies that , even in its prime , made a lot of sense to them . however , the only thing about the film that has an impact on this story is the movie itself . here i would have to say that this book is one of the few films that have been published in over 50 years . there were many other books out there similar to this one that are not written down for the rest of time .|0
spoilers below ` a dog ' s life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . in charlie chaplin 's case , not only because of his musical talent and his singing but also because he appeared to know every single song by heart . so i had seen plenty of movies when i was a kid and they were usually very good . even on the cheap , i thought this one was bad . however , it is not bad and i have to say that if charlie chaplin has been making an odd spectacle out of himself all this time , how come it did not get better ?|0
garlin outdoes himself as writer - director - actor in his indie production about a big guy ( garlin ) wandering around chicago with a lot more money than he realizes . it all sounds like a plot line but the actual ending of the novel has to have been done by someone who knew exactly what they were doing and how to get the job done . this is a story i read many years ago when i wrote it . the characters and dialogue were so bad , that i found myself unable to concentrate on the storyline again .|0
there are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ` ` not human ' ' is portraying human beings and it makes no sense to me at that stage . the worst part about these movies is when i was young , i watched this film in my sleep . one of the most terrible parts was the time when someone gets into the lion 's den . all of a sudden the entire world becomes a giant zoo filled with wild cats , wolves , and bears . every movie on dvd is pretty much as bad as it gets .|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one ! i watched her play the flute . she was pretty good , but her voice was weak and lacked its natural authority . i thought the most amazing song i have ever heard ! i mean , look at her . how could such a talented singer be so bad that she could write such beautiful songs like this ? it 's like she has n't spent any time at all out of the theatre . i looked at the screen and saw a young man in uniform with a microphone standing on a stage behind the audience .|0
' captain corelli ' s mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . it is nothing like the book , which has many more twists and turns . this is the kind of documentary that i thought would get me into a good film school . what do you make of this film ? i was so tired that my head got dizzy . i had just finished a very interesting experience and wanted to turn off my lights for a few hours . there were no lights at all on the screen . the director told me that most of them could only be turned on by the computer .|0
when his elderly mother emily ( jeanne bates ) is attacked by her lodger nestor duvalier ( brion james ) who beats her and then tries to steal her property . they try to help her and then try again . this is a terrible episode of the night of the great flood . after the movie they go home and call their family but no one responds to their calls . as it turns out , the only person on the street was the neighbor 's daughter whose husband died last year . the girl had a boyfriend and she was angry at him for stealing away her brother and sister .|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
i hope , from his seat on heaven ' s comedic throne , spike milligan can see and can enjoy this movie better . he was not wrong . this movie is a lot like the one which you watch at my house over the next ten months of living in new york city . i hate that movie . it reminds me of last year 's film where i lost my job for two reasons . 1 ) i do not trust these people to have any real credibility with their own family . 2 ) they are trying to get rid of me by pretending to be my girlfriend .|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
truly unique and stunning film of jules verne ' s ` ` for the flag ' ' by the czech master director karel . it takes place in rome in 1917 and remains in the public domain for decades after its publication ( i do n't care how old it gets ) . a long time ago there was an award for most popular film in this country , but now it has been cut off from the rest of europe . some people seem to be happy with what they see or hear about it , while others are completely indifferent .|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
saw the film at the closing gala of the ealing film festival in west london ( england ) . enjoyed the film ? yes . but why did i see this ? i do n't get why it was on dvd . is there more to this movie than what i initially thought ? i am a man of action and suspense . i will not allow my mind to wander , for fear of forgetting who i am and having to be reminded of what i have become . i had just left home when i happened to see something which made me stop dead in my tracks and turn around with a cold stare .|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
charles chaplin ' s ' shoulder arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over two hundred pages . i hope the movie is a little more realistic than the ones he used to watch . i have never seen a movie as bad as this one , although i have seen enough to know what it 's going to do to you . not only do the characters and the dialog make the script look better but also the dialogue seems to be based on something completely different than the plot .|0
"but a great cast ! jonathan pryce , kathy bates , rupert everett , lynne redgrave , julie andrews and laura kappa ' s son , are all good actors . you may see a number of talented actors who were here when this film was made . they all enjoyed the movie . it ' s not often i find myself with a new protagonist in my life . there are times where i feel as if i could be better than the old me . to hear the story of the wonderful actor ( james "" don "" mcnamara ) at play is like hearing his voice on some low - budget radio ."|0
"i just ca n ' t understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . it was never supposed to make any sense when it came along , "" tom said as he finished the last bite of his food . he looked up and saw tom looking at him . tom sat there for a few moments then said , "" you really want me to explain all that ? "" he got up out of his chair and went over to sit next to grace . she smiled and said , "" yes , let 's see it ! """|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house . i have a really bad habit of moving my legs in the air when i dance , and even though it has been three days since we last saw each other , i can feel myself beginning to get attached to this thing that is happening . i guess i am hoping i do n't end up like my mother ; someone who spends most of her time trying to figure out what to do so she can become an actress .|0
years ago when i first read john irving ' s the world according to garp , i was astounded that most of these movies were not like this one . they are a lot less romantic than the stuff he ' s portraying me with . and it ' s certainly not what i saw in this movie . i would be willing to bet that it was about an american girl . her family does some amazing things for other families . here ' s what i found myself doing : i spent the next week trying to find someone who could give me a job .|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
"what a surprise . a basic copycat of the comedy classic ' the nutty professor ' only naughtier . funny guy in a very bad joke , but no one laughed . i have watched this film twice before : once on a late night tv show and again because it had some kind of plot to it that was so absurd you could not take the time to look it over . this "" crazy professor "" is an idea that i considered a waste of money . i thought it was good until i watched it after reading the first half . i decided to give it another try for a new movie ."|0
for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , science , video , music , movies , and all manner of material , but who are really in control ? even the most self - absorbed of people ca n't keep up with it . they simply ca n't . they have to be told to shut their eyes and stop thinking about it . this would be a waste of time . if you could do it , how would you have solved this problem ? what is one person supposed to do after having his entire life spent doing so ?|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
the writers of lost have outdone themselves . season two ' s finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the previous season . this was one of the most emotional times in my life . i ca n't imagine a more dramatic moment when the people around me could hear a movie set going on about how to get out of what you think of as being a war zone . or , if you prefer that term , a film with so many scenes it would not be worth remembering unless you watch it over and over . no , this film does not have much of a feeling of importance .|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen . as you may have heard , the movie does not make me feel any better . i never thought that it was a good movie anyway . what is the point of being an actor if you are never going to know how to act ? then there is the part where the whole character gets blown apart by a plane crash . in other words , the plot is totally horrible and the scene is just plain boring . the acting is very poor .|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
i would say ' bride of chucky ' is a ` ` return to greatness ' ' but the series was never really over . we made it through only one scene , but this time we were more than a little annoyed by the fact that we kept getting thrown out . the book was not just great , it was awful . if you had to see a sequel to this stupid book , then there are some really horrible things that would be fun . let 's get to the part where the movie was all about people and they were all in total love with each other .|0
"this movie was great . it had everything a true action fan could want . plenty of people getting shot for it . if i could have seen the reviews , i would never have been able to do it on dvd . but there was nothing bad about it . the premise was simple and entertaining and the characters seemed like they knew how to handle themselves better than those of us who just watched them over the last week . well , as far as i can see , there were only a few bad comedies and that was it . "" "" what about the rest ? """|0
the movie is excellent . acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . it seems to me that there are some great comedic twists in this genre that i am just starting to enjoy . i do not want to waste any more time with this film . it is too boring and repetitive . i know i should get out of here for a while but i can see no way out of it . the best thing about having such a good film ? it is an easy job to write your own script , even if the dialogue is rather slow and difficult to figure out .|0
head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( the monkees and victor mature ) , but for all its beauty and character . if i had to choose one of my most beloved movies , i would pick the one that is least impressive : an oscar fines award for the best actor ever . it was one of the last films i watched before going off to college , and i found that i liked it . i thought it was supposed to be something romantic and funny , and i felt sorry for the actors who starred in that film .|0
i loved this film , which i have just seen at the philadelphia film festival . in march 2005 i watched it with my mom and dad , as i sat in the living room while she played with her children who were very young . i felt so proud when i saw it that i had tears streaming down my face . they must have thought we were being a lot of fun because there was lots of crying and screaming and shouting . it did n't take long before i began to feel sad about the movie and i kept watching the whole thing .|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
this is a funny movie . the bob & eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i thought it would be interesting to witness some of the movies being made by hollywood and other people who are actors or editors . when they start using the words ' acting ' with their characters , you know what that means do n't you ? i did not even want to watch this because i thought it would make me lose sleep if i saw the film again . in reality it was more like an educational episode than a science fiction movie .|0
"i gave it a seven only because the acting is good . and of course by that i mean wilkinson is an awesome actor . he looks like a poster child for how great actors can be . it was awful when he went to a bad movie , but he got away with it . my dad always says "" this is a bad idea "" . i have never heard him say "" bad "" before in my life . i do n't remember much about this guy . he did n't even bother to get his own name ."|0
"it took me a while to find this movie since they do n ' t have it yet on dvd ( and for the record , not that i ever watch film in particular ) . but now i finally do . as you all know , it 's a pretty good film , even when it is just a bunch of nonsense . like this : 
 i got into college and went to my first - year english school with a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach . i am a little scared of the teacher , who is a really loud man ."|0
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
just exactly how director john madden come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope cruz playing the roles of an evil villain in this movie . i also saw some film , but i have never watched it . the plot is so funny that you may not even believe it has any truth behind it as a character . if you ask me , it is only because the director said so . there are plenty of stories about these characters that people will like for their movies . what i am really getting at is who is the real villain ? why does he get to be the good guy ?|0
it ' s a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and end up shooting each other ) , but this story is all about bad people . as i said , this is the first time i have seen this film since the first time i heard from an author who was looking for a movie to write . this film was made over 20 years before it became a regular issue . it has no plot or plot at all . it wasn ' t a good film . it just makes you want to run away in terror .|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
little gus is a ten year old delinquent . he runs away from his parents and decides to go on a wild joyride through the park . as an innocent boy , he falls in with the biggest crowd of teenagers you ever seen . he starts getting into trouble by taking risks that would otherwise cause him to be locked up in a mental facility . it is n't until the end of the second year that i finally have time to really look back and see what happens to people when they take chances . this is one of those times .|0
chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the life back into his body . he is unable to control his bladder even when he gets home from work . that is what made this film so amazing . the movie itself was a waste of good material . the most embarrassing part of it was the following : i am going to take a break and go sit down in the office . it will probably only be 15 minutes , maybe fifteen , but i should at least start off with some fun .|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
this is one of chaplin ' s first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more dramatic version . well , all he ever wanted was to go to america and see the great film , but that was out of character for him and his father . i never actually saw a big deal about these episodes , just thought they were some kind of super - plot . i am still trying to understand the main point of this movie , but it will be easy enough to check out if you like them .|0
"this is one of the best of the early ` ` star trek ' ' episodes , with kirk and his crew acting like idiots . in fact , it makes me laugh so hard that i have to go into the bathroom , and take a long time to calm down . when you watch the "" star trek "" reruns of the first two decades of life for the first three or four years , you get used to them . but once you watch the original version , you realize how little you will actually know about this stuff ."|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
cult - director lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place on the film world series . but he is also not a very good movie and it would be really hard to get a good script out there , in any form . so i wanted to watch this movie as much as i liked watching it . i did n't know where it was made but i loved how it came out , especially the ending . i found myself looking forward to seeing this film more and more as the years wore on .|0
` ` d . o . a ' ' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . dennis quaid is at his wits ' end , as he tells this story . i have never been much interested in sports . i do enjoy the occasional game , but i am generally more into tv than science fiction . there seems to be a whole bunch of things that i should like about this show . most of the characters are extremely dull , short - lived or boring . this is just so boring , it makes me cringe .|0
i thought that the storyline came into place very well . i liked this movie a lot . if you like it , i 'm sure you would love it . i can see why they wanted to film it here and there . after all , i do n't think anybody was interested in listening to how the characters were reacting . so i hope you will consider taking me as a friend . not only because i am an ex - army man but because i have never watched this movie before on any other television . the whole point of this movie is to make you think that something really bad could happen to me .|0
"you know , people who make comedies so often forget it ' s really ok to be outrageous . well , this is one of those things . "" "" i just did n't have any trouble understanding the point of this . i was at a club and saw a young boy doing what he said . he had his arm around some girl and he was acting very strange . when i went back to my friend , i asked her if there was something going on in the club with him . she said yes but she was afraid to tell me . "" "" oh !"|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
i do n ' t usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch in case it got turned on by itself . i thought i was getting pretty close to the end until the film went into action , and then i started thinking about how much i did enjoy watching the film and wondering what kind of a story it really was . as the night wore on and we watched the film , all i had to do was sit back and watch some more of the good movies and feel a lot better afterwards .|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . accepted , but undeserved . i think a lot of people would agree with me . how can someone who is so stupid as to spend his life trying to change the way he looks or what he says should have been made in such a ridiculous way ? it was pretty bad at times , too bad , but it did not give me much time to be angry . after all , it has only been a few weeks and the movie does sound very boring .|0
separate lies changed my life . actually , the q & a did . spoilers below . read only if you watch this movie with your own two eyes , and not just because of the premise and characters . i mean , why would someone write a horror film ? after all , they know it 's real and there are no rules that forbid it from being done . also , what happens if you go into a store for an item and have to find out how many other items exist ? well , you would find out by watching the most expensive movies ever made .|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a young movie star . he was one of the best actors in all of hollywood , with only one minor flaw - he had no friends . there were few people that did like him or respected him . he was always on screen and kept to himself . even though he worked for the same movie company as most of them , there was never anything positive about it ; it just was not likable . after years of working with the film companies , it became clear that the project was useless .|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"due to its predictable , second - rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in italy , at least for a price , and i 'm sure this book will be read by all of you on several occasions ) . i do have a few words that i wish to share with you : 
 ... "" if you can make any sense of my life , you need only write me a single word , and everything will fall into place "" . i ' m just kidding . i did not want to be writing about this movie ."|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . i found the film to be a very old , classic one . it was all about a bunch of women who had two sons and were constantly going out with men they did not truly love . i do not see that there is any reason to think this film was based on anything other than real life in the beginning . i just want to say that i am shocked at how quickly it started . i thought it was such an epic failure that i felt sorry for it .|0
if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n ' t watch . it 's not for me , however , to be a part of it . in fact i am going to tell you that this movie shows an almost supernatural level of heroism which i personally think is a terrible thing . there was no reason why i should have seen this movie . i never watched these movies , i only saw them on the news once , and i just thought it was really scary .|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
the very few reviews i could find online of barnens o really do not do it justice . i read it in the third edition , but it still feels like a comedy , especially after the first couple of weeks . if you are looking for anything funny about barnens o real , the main thing to think about when you walk into the film is how long it takes for the person to be introduced to the movie before making a conscious attempt to see it . this movie is absolutely no fun . there are just too many scenes and images that make it seem like it has been played for years .|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
what an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it after a few hours of being told not to see it in theaters . this film would have been good if it were n't for its lack of originality . there was nothing romantic or romantic about it . all of the scenes were horribly out of character , which really just makes me want to kick myself for not seeing them in action sooner . why am i even looking at this one ? i like it , but do you think that i could ever get a job when i work as a security consultant ?|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from ! for years i had been hoping that i would be able to retire and start a new career but no such luck . i had always felt like i was doomed to failure after watching this film . if i was going to become famous as a singer i would rather make a living off my talent than live out of my car . unfortunately , i did not learn that during this movie i am going to die so i just have to save myself some money .|0
for all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever and fun to watch . you can read the reviews on the web - site ; see what else this is really about . i just thought it would be nice to have some company at my home . so far this film has been great . it has done well , but in the end it was an uninteresting horror film with a lot of twists . i never saw anything like this before . i liked it very much and am happy that someone has enjoyed it .|0
captain corelli ' s mandolin is no oscar contender but it was pretty good . i have to admit ms cruz really likes her music . i guess that is something i am going to have to try and live vicariously through the rest of my life . i suppose i should have been more impressed , or at least surprised that this is one of the best ones in the country . so much for finding some decent songs in a small town . if there are no other options , then maybe i need to give this a shot .|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
great movie . post - apocalyptic films kick ass . this one is no exception . kept up the pace and interest at least for two weeks of all the drama , but it was a damn good movie . it did its best , but with the added problem that it could be so poorly conceived . as soon as you make your mind up to see what you will find , you are in for an interesting experience . first off , do you know how to play a game ? there is one rule i learned : do not put your hands into the pool .|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
i do n ' t usually comment on films since i am in the movie distribution business , but i have to say that one is very entertaining . i can not think what you would expect from such an ugly piece of film . i was hoping for a more realistic version of the first three films i ever saw . it was not quite as awful as the first two . i guess the only thing that got me through these last two episodes was the dialogue and the plot . there are no good comedies ( which i found funny when i looked at some of the scenes in the book ) .|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
if you like who - dun - its , you will like this film , considered the best italian detective story ( giallo ) . that 's how i wanted it to end ! now , what about this one ? when i watched the movie i was n't sure what i saw . well , i saw a lot of movies . the first two are pretty bad , i admit , but i had a good laugh . after the third scene , i tried to find out what the movie was about and why they were watching it .|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
"sit back and let director bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of the human race that may or may not have been written by any of us . here , i will show it to you on my computer as soon as you can read this . i would like to give an account of some of the scenes involved in this series , but they are so far below your expectations . the scene itself is very interesting , for it really just consists of the three guys fighting off a band of wannabe badasses ( "" losers "" ) ."|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
spoilersi love the simpsons , and i have seen every single episode that had ever come out . i must say this book has more to do with my character than any other movie i have ever seen , which is not surprising at all . it was based upon the same old line of crap from a very different set of people . i could n't wait to find out what the author was talking about . there 's nothing like one of the characters who thinks they can win over his entire town by bringing them back from the brink of annihilation . the plot is so bizarre !|0
i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . quickly the movie grabbed me by the ears and it started to turn me into one of those weird characters that people talk about . while the movie was good , the dialogue is pretty much the same . as i sat through every single episode , i had an overwhelming urge to throw up or vomit or even take a nap somewhere . i did all of the usual things i normally do in my dreams . for example , i slept for twenty minutes and then woke up almost immediately after being woken up .|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
i am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that richard gear is bad , but it did not matter . there was absolutely nothing in the movie about any of the characters being able to get on the train and get off . they just went crazy and went after every single one of them ! it was n't as bad as i had initially thought at first , but when i got the hang of it , it was actually rather interesting . this movie is a disaster . the actors are really good , but they are like kids playing monsters .|0
a film about the relationship between a man and leopard that ' s very reminiscent of ` ` the english patient , ' but it has also been edited by a young american woman named anne . as far as i can see nothing wrong with an actress having sex with her lover , but you do know that there are some issues in this movie that even i want to ignore . well , at least most people who ' ll listen think that i would be interested in watching this kind of film if i couldn ' t say that it was actually funny and amusing at the same time .|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
ok so paris hilton sucks in it ( typical malibu barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just average people . there is no movie and they do not care what movies are like because they have no reason to waste time . i can say for a fact that the characters are much more entertaining when they are standing straight up rather than at their desks , but that is another story that should be left with a sequel or two . after reading this novel , i ca n't wait to hear what happens on the cover . how exciting !|0
i was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in salt lake city , utah and working on some projects for a few months . when i was 18 , i got my license to practice martial arts and then moved out to arizona . i had no idea i was leaving salt lake until the following month . so what if i 'm not an adult now ? i still know how to fight . anyway , let me take this back . it 's one of those moments when the world is watching you and you can actually see things around you that are not there .|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
the golden door is the story of a sicilian family ' s journey from the old world ( italy ) to the new , and how much they ' ve earned for their adventures . here , i will go on and tell you why i ' m so impressed by what this movie is about - i don ' t know if this film has been done before , but there ' s something about it that seems to me that the only thing that makes it worth watching is the fact that this movie is one of the worst films ever made in history .|0
"one of the most magnificent movies ever made . the acting of charles buchinski ( later known as bronson ) in the late ' 70s has to have been very good . i think that it was not really "" the best "" or "" the most , "" but just pretty close . what is "" the greatest film ever made ? "" ? ? ? if you are looking at the sequel , then you are looking at this movie because you do n't want to be bored . it also shows that these films are basically a waste of money . the movie is a complete waste of credits ."|0
i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . i go to the movies , but i have no knowledge of a lot of scenes that are not very romantic . i do know that most of the action shows are quite dull and boring , but there is nothing bad about them . it was like they ' d never written a plot or any characters . the movie itself would be just fine , but you would not want to watch that because you might miss something in the film . there was one character that seemed to be completely disinterested in anything else that was said .|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
belonging to the subgenre of post - apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . the premise can not be altered into something else , so the characters are not intended as a narrative line or a narrative . this is a classic movie from the late ' 50s and early ' 60s . in its original form the plot was based solely on the film 's premise . i will admit , at first i did not get what this was about . it just seemed too real . that night i started to see scenes that were not even remotely realistic .|0
( synopsis ) graduating high school senior bartleby ` ` b ' ' gaines ( justin long ) finds himself without a partner for the first time in his career . when he begins making a list of people who ' d rather be there to watch him go to bed , he has to put one together and make some sense out of it . then again , if you ' re going to watch someone like that , you should at least be able to do so much better from a safe distance . i could use a bit of advice from a girl who had been in love with a man for nearly a decade .|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
"the first time i saw this movie , i just thought ` ` what the hell ? ' ' a 10 - year - old kid .

this film was made right in the area where i grew up and now live . i know personally most of the things about that movie , but i like the characters and their style . when it comes to movies you just go with what you see and do n't think much about the rest . so i thought i should make a little extra money on this one . anyway , i have been working here for many years and did not notice much of anything in this film ' til i saw it a few months back . there is something wrong with it .|0
when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for a sequel to the original horror film , which i have yet to see . i know what they were like before you walked in here , it was scary ! as i said , it was a movie but i still liked the plot with a little more mystery . i really wanted to see something different on camera so i bought some of the best things that i could find and watched it . unfortunately , it looked like the same thing every time i saw it .|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar ! the film took a while to pick up from the reviews but it got well written . this movie was quite interesting for a young girl with limited imaginations who did not seem to want to put her money where her mouth should be . when she first went on this journey i thought that she could have done a better job , at least in my book . she just wanted to do better , and i think i would have liked to have enjoyed it too . however , once i started reading the books i had no idea how good they would be .|0

His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
i ca n ' t get this flick off my brain . it ' s definitely totally different than anything that ' s out there . you ' d have seen a bunch of action movie scenes . this one makes it look as if the villain is on his knees , his hands tied behind his back so he ' s helpless and powerless . at first glance it appears that the villain is suffering from an allergic reaction to the medication . the only thing that stands out to me is that when i started watching this film , everything seemed to be going along according to script .|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
he did one at christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific justin timberlake is about to get shot in his head . oh my god . i feel like crying . what have i done ? it should not be possible for me to feel this good after being so angry all day long . i will never understand why i am doing this . maybe i want to be with sam , but then again , if that 's what they want , it would be an excellent reason for me to make it through the day .|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
made at the height of the black power movement , this movie portrays african - american putney swope ( arnold johnson ) as being extremely dangerous and destructive in his quest to control the whole nation . when he first watched it i thought he would like it because of the dialogue and the acting , but once again i was wrong . the actors were n't even really that good . they had been too caught up in making a movie based on some other reality show . after all , these characters are nothing more than bad actors who have given up on ever seeing the stars of their favorite western .|0
i was n ' t expecting a great deal from this film , so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it . although the story was fairly easy to see , you could not believe how many people have come up with some of the stuff that made it worth watching . as soon as we saw the film , my eyes started moving to the middle of the screen where everyone in the place was waiting for their turn to watch it . there was something so very surreal and strange about watching such a horrible scene . what is one to do with that movie anyway ?|0
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
* * 1 / 2 elisha cuthbert , chad michael murray , brian van holt , paris hilton and jon abrahams . the author of this book has his own ' characters ' , which is what i had originally hoped would happen to me , but instead it did n't . for one thing , it was a dumb idea to do this book . its not even good comedy . i 'm disappointed in the movie . why should the actors actually care about a film that is supposed to be just a plot ? if you ask me , the only reason i watched this movie was so i could watch it .|0
anyone who has seen ali g before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is ' ali g ' . i do not know what was so awful about that movie . after all , if you are a man , you have to get off your butt and go through it . how long does it take you to see this movie ? it was pretty bad when it started because of all the extra work that goes into filming it . in fact , there is more than one main reason why the film did not even look real .|0
chucky ( the murderous doll from ` ` child ' s play ' ' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . but i still wanted to be there , so i thought i would see if it was an open book . here we go again : this story starts out well with a pretty good rendition of a bad movie ( the worst that ever happened to you ) but ends up being nothing but a failure as soon as it comes into focus . when it 's over , it all comes back to the fact that most of my life has been a waste .|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage , but there is no end in sight . you do not know what this film is like , how it 's played , even how it was portrayed . all you can say is that it is a waste of good time and effort . i am sorry if you think that it would be fun to watch this movie ; i actually love this film , and i never thought i would feel that way , but these are the worst moments of my life .|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
"i recently saw blind spot in coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . i was just thinking how interesting that movie could be when you see it first - hand at the beach with all its characters doing silly stuff like they 're going to die or something . "" he stopped talking for a minute . "" so anyway , do you mind if i watch this movie ? i have n't seen any other movies yet . my favorite show has been on the cover of several different major cable shows and i 'm not sure which ones will make it to the next episode .

nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 ' s academy awards , my architect follows filmmaker nathaniel kahn in his quest to make one of the most important movies ever released . he finds himself in this predicament and wonders what he would do if it were an american movie . as a kid i have no desire to see a movie like this , especially not one that is so bad or so good that nobody wants to watch it . i was only able to watch it by myself when i was eight years old . i never got the chance to watch it with anyone because i was too busy studying .|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
1930 ' s comedy mystery about ` ` the crooked circle ' ' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the downfall of the soviet union . this was the first episode i ever saw in which the director of the comedy had the misfortune to be forced to read it by his sister . she is very disappointed with the film . there was an element of disappointment in the title , but the audience loved it . so did i. we actually found the book amusing , and then we laughed at the whole affair until our stomachs started to hurt from laughing for so long .|0
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . excellent original music , clever , heady . . . it 's amazing ! how did i miss that ? i 'm going to try and edit this movie so that i can see it a second time when i see you in it . this film was very good with the lead actor and his crew . i mean , if you are a guy who is trying to impress the girl ( or her friend ) at a party by yourself - you will be disappointed .|0
my favorite show of all time ! yeah , i thought this was so cool , and larisa oleynik was the best in the whole set . her voice was beautiful , and she sang beautifully , making it sound like someone was going to pay for this . as we watched this segment , it got more and more horrible . i saw the characters acting out a scene that went horribly wrong . if i were to look around some more , i could see how similar their lives were . but there was one other thing that really caught my eye about this film .|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
` ` live together , die alone ' ' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them consists of a picture of the characters as to what they are thinking or doing . in other words , there 's no point in looking for a way to tell which character is correct . you can see from the looks on people 's faces it is very difficult to imagine that they are going to be okay . maybe it 's just because i do n't really believe this movie should have any kind of good quality . however , my opinion was not greatly altered by these films .|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
"pity the monkees . people always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than characters , who were either very good or very poor and just did n't work out what their roles in the movie were . for example , that was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen in my life ! it was so awful and scary . as i watched these horrible movie trailers , i thought to myself , "" if this is real , then why does the movie seem to be so awful ? "" the plot was so terrible i felt like i could barely stand it !"|0
` ` showtime ' ' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what other people have said . there are only a couple of good movies that do show this movie at all , and by the end of it i think i can see why . in addition , these were not even made here by the film company ; no one 's really sure where they came from . you may find them as easy to understand if you take a few minutes to read them . let me tell you the story of this movie .|0
i taped the morrison murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the morrison murders on lifetime , lifetime movie network and they were all really good . there are so many different ones that you have to be sure to watch them more times than you would like . well , the last one was a horror flick that started with me and my friends as kids in new york trying to escape from a zombie outbreak by having a little fun with a guy we met on our way uptown . we had been hanging out with some old friends from the high school when we saw this movie .|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
"this is not the masterpiece that is snow white , cinderella , or bambi , but it is a very interesting story in an enjoyable way , "" i told him . what 's your name ? "" his face broke into a rare smile which was so charming that i thought he might break my heart . then he leaned forward slightly and said , "" let me guess . you do n't like american films because you hate the idea of making them ? why did you choose westerns ? "" i laughed and said , "" i like westerns as many times as anyone else ."|0
the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo , regardless of the age of the oav . the plot may have some flaws , and there are lots of other issues that need to be corrected , but this is not one i would recommend for anyone who has spent enough time in this book to even come close to seeing how it actually ends up . a lot of characters do not know what they 're getting into , and most of them seem to have been forced into this as a joke . at first i was surprised by the lack of humor , especially since i had an audience to share it with .|0
then again , i like rachael ray . she is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to be around . we have no idea how many people we can talk to about all of the different ways you can be gay , but i 'm looking forward to getting some answers . i do not believe there is anything wrong with being gay . i just know it sucks . i am going to keep that in mind if i ever meet this girl . i wonder why i always thought it would be me . i suppose because it is so hard to find someone that i feel like i can trust .|0
a beautifully photographed and paced short film . it evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the role , as well as the portrayal that is used to show them . i do not even really know how to begin to describe what was actually done in this scene . it was an extremely unromantic scene . the cast had a great selection of actors ; the director was a character from the first film . we were all told to watch the film and follow the rules , but this was so boring . there is nothing fun about the movie !|0
the aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on imdb . the songs are n ' t so good , and by the end of the second season , i think most of the boys in town have gone home sick . the first couple of days i was happy to see a whole group of us come out at night to watch the new yorkers perform . for one thing , they actually had a musical talent . i thought it was all an act until i learned that not only was this a very lame production , but there were people who could not even find their vocal chords .|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . and make no mistake , when i say i am a lot more cynical than most people believe , it is true that i was born and raised in the ' 90s . i actually made a lot of money off the movies my parents gave me growing up because i would never have taken them out to dinner . ( let us just say they were not exactly good friends . ) after i graduated high school and moved to new york city , there was an idea for this movie .|0
easily lucio fulci ' s most respected film , ` ` do n ' t torture a duckling ' ' is highly renowned for it ' and its critics . the movie has been written in such a way that i can only surmise that it was set for a very limited budget with an estimated $ 50 per cast . my friends and family are amazed at the expense of such an amazing film . but this one makes them all happy . they have had the good fortune to see this film before having to take part in some of the most boring movies on the market .|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which this film should be made . it was not difficult for him to make his point and then proceed to tell me what he thinks is going on . first of all , you may think it would be funny to have the story of this movie being read over and over again but it just is not . second , i do like the novel ( although it sounds like a waste of time ) and there is absolutely no point in wasting time on it !|0
it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . a brutal but beautiful death , where there are no survivors . to my way of thinking , there is only one good thing to do here . i will go to sleep and try to forget about the horror of this war . i am going to write this story for my children 's benefit . i feel so happy that i can not take any more of these people with me because i know i could spend the rest of my life suffering out here on this barren rock .|0
i ca n ' t say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often i ' ve described it since . the main thing is , no one had ever written this movie , and they are still not sure whether it actually happened or was staged as a joke . i have to admit the acting was fine at first , but eventually i found myself on the verge of crying . i have never seen this movie . if you don ' t like it , why bother ? the script was pretty good , too good . i mean really good .|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
this movie , based on a true story of gerrit wolfaardt , is one of the best films i ' ve ever seen . i wrote this book because i can ' t believe it ' s going to make a difference . my first novel had an excellent premise which i have enjoyed immensely . i really like the characters but they are too big for me . i enjoy movies that do well in their own respective fields as well . my second book was a good example - a real horror movie with a better ending and a few plot flaws .|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
the cover of the vhs says it all : ` ` without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind ever produced in a lifetime . ' there is a long list of film makers and producers that i have only seen one at a time . some are very good - sounding people from around the world who actually sound like they have been told to go to bed with their girlfriends . this movie just does not have any humor . if you watch the same video over and over again , you will find a few errors . the plot is a little too complicated for my tastes .|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
i thought this was movie was great , richard greico and yasmine bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . it 's a little scary , but with good reason . not many people who have any sense of humor find it humorous at all . if you would like to get an idea of what they were talking about do n't wait for my response . i can tell you now that i have only read the first couple of book releases over the last few weeks . when i went online to check out this novel and there was a bunch of stuff coming up , i wanted to make sure no one else found it .|0
sacha baron cohen is a genius . and this movie is good ! although the film does n ' t nearly reach that point , i don ' t see where it can make any difference to these two characters . for example , they do not look like the same people at all , nor do they seem to have the same interests . as far as i can tell , they each have their own story . well , let ' s see - first of all , they do not appear in different parts of the earth .|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
the ` ` old dark house ' ' sub - genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re - view the film . this is a real horror film , and while i do n't agree that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen on television , the plot was good , the acting was great , and i am quite surprised at myself for not reading the reviews or making a note in order to make them less terrible . this movie is particularly hard to watch because there were no obvious things that caught my eye .|0
forget easy rider - head is the film about the 1960s . almost laugh : as the monkees reduce their entire career to a few movies they get a lot of laughter out of this film . well , actually that 's a little over the top for them . it sounds like you guys have a pretty good reputation for your acting expertise , but let me ask you : why did you even bother with such a ridiculous movie anyway ? what was the point at being in a movie and not be seen on the screen ? i do n't think i wanted to be seen on tv .|0
ross hunter ' s musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on james hilton ' s enduring bestseller , was written in the early 70s when he was only 14 years old . that movie took off in 2005 and became the reason for many of the problems associated with it . in addition to a few minor setbacks here and there , i also learned that it ' d be nice to have this film as a full time director . unfortunately , most of my time at home is spent with my laptop . it ' s been three years since i last saw it .|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story.

"i first saw ` ` signs of life ' ' on pbs as an american playhouse presentation . it ' s a wonderfully romantic plot and very nice . but i didn ' t see that at the end because i was busy trying to figure out what is so interesting here in washington , dc and where we are supposed to go . when i asked her what she thought of the movie , she had said , "" why do you think there ' s such a big change in history ? people don ' t change things all that often ."|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
nobody ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of japanese noir . it ' s about three salarymen who get in over their heads , being chased by the devil when they enter a nightclub . this sequel was a great one , and has starred in a couple of horror films . i would like to share some more of my favorite movies with my new readers . first of all , if you ' ve ever heard of a man who had his heart ripped from his chest , you will understand why he was able to walk away .|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
damien o ' donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but i do n't know what to expect . the movie was really great - i 'm looking forward to seeing it next time . if you have something that is too much for my liking you can get it now , but if you are not available at this time then i would be happy to recommend it to other readers . all i will ask is for feedback . thanks for reading ! i also wanted to say thanks to many people for their sympathy and help on this journey of life .|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
this is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . it follows all the characters and leads up to the ending , where we meet the protagonist when they come back from class on friday . i have yet to hear the last episode that comes after this one . i know it is supposed to end well , but if you look at the movie just right and watch it through your eyes , you can find no errors in the first thirty minutes . it 's like watching a christmas movie .|0
i ' ve read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark . i think it might be a bit too far - fetched , but if this movie is actually very good , i would like to see an episode or two . if not , then perhaps you can show me one or two of your better films . there are certain things in this book that i thought were going to do a wonderful job for the production line , and i have found myself wanting to enjoy this one .|0
fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1 . at first he goes to bed , but then he falls asleep for the first time since his return . he spends a week in hospital and wakes up on monday . that is the last i heard from him before he died . i was so happy to see him , i thought my heart would break . i felt so awful about seeing him die . if i could ' t stop it , i should n't have made the mistake of making myself sick .|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
this film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and struggle in america . i had no idea you were a writer . it was too much for me to handle . we have been together for years and i could not deal with being alone after watching this movie . there are many people who would have liked it , but i wanted one of them to know that he or she does not make me cry . it was very undeserved . it was awful . i was devastated .|0
mark blankfield ( from the old late night tv show ` ` fridays ' ' ) plays dr . daniel jekyll , a good actor in college , plays a friend of ours who lives in town and has an interesting story about him that is intriguing . while i have seen some similar films , they have never been as interesting as this . you would think that these things were not even really there ; but let me say something for sure : it is definitely real ! we all live in one large house with lots of great stories to tell and lots of action to do .|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
the snowqueen is one of the best love stories i have ever seen : much better and deeper than luhrman could have dreamed . in fact , there was very little about the movie to suggest that luhrman might have made it a success . what really gets me is how much the plot was based on the same premise . this movie is totally ridiculous , which means that you should pay money to watch it . it is such a miserable film that i can not think why i bothered to watch it . maybe because i am too ashamed to even look at it again .|0
"this is one of my favorite films , ever . the story is just so fantastic and the characters are very interesting and even though they do seem like they 're in a movie , i guess you would be amazed at the number of hours of sleep i have slept over the past two nights . i hope you enjoyed this novel . if you did , i hope you 'll want to read it again next year . if you will , please take a chance on me being able to get it published . thanks ! love ya !

"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limits . . . hmm . . . . only that this was one of my favourites : a short story based on an old school horror thriller ( although it does appear like the film has been written in the late nineteenth century ) . the story focuses upon a man who believes that he is an alien and is seeking out aliens to destroy his race . he decides to go after the alien first . there are many explanations , and no one ever seems to figure out what exactly happened between the two species .|0
i will admit , i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 seconds it seemed to be getting better . then a couple of people said they saw something that made them say they thought it was a great movie . i did n't know how anyone who saw a movie could ever make that up ! i wanted to see it with my own eyes . but i would have preferred not to watch it again . i still remember trying to get some good footage on the way to hollywood , but got nothing .|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . it is just not available yet and i was looking forward to seeing all the action on dvd . i am in a huge rush to get my life back on track . at first i did not even care where i got this film from or when i got it but after a while i found myself looking forward to spending more time watching it . once i started getting into the film i felt that i had to put on some kind of act , which seemed to be working very well at the beginning of the episode .|0
the aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . clearly not that many because it only works if you know the actors . however , it is an amazing piece of artwork and as such will get a great shot . in this story , one has to be prepared to watch the show . i am also ready to watch the movie . i wish it would have been better . it is a shame that it has to go live . it really makes me realize that we have to pay more attention to the real world .|0
"just as in ` ` columbo ' ' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . what follows is an uninteresting but very long - winded history of one of the most remarkable events in the modern world . it goes like this : 
 1 . i have been a policeman in the city , for less than a week , and i have no experience whatsoever on the street . i was a young policeman in the late 1920 's when i was told by the chief commissioner that there might be a murder committed by a boy who was caught in the cross fire ."|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
i ' ve been a fan of rachael ' s since the beginning of 30mm on the food network , so i know it ' s not her fault - but still , the movie has its problems . the film is very funny and full of interesting things about people who are really in love at the time and who just ca ' t stop seeing each other . why do you think that was ? it ' s a good movie for someone with my high level of reading skills . the actors are so easy to get along with , the audience likes them , and everyone likes them !|0
no . i ' m not kidding with this one . he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave a great description of me . at one point i even went to see my favorite movie , but by that time i had already seen it numerous times . since then i have always been a bit disappointed in how the film made things seem good in the beginning . as the reader learns more about the film , the worst is yet to come . there are just so many elements which make up the film that they all do not add up correctly .|0
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
what ' s the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season . . . here is a little example of how much you should watch out for it . at this stage , we all know the first two events are the most horrible in the whole show - but they ' ve got a lot more impact than anything on the second one . i think i saw the third one on television once when i was younger and i had no clue what was going on , although i have seen many episodes like that .|0
i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! i really enjoyed this one because it was just too bad . but now i feel like i will be watching it again and i will have to turn the screen off or something , which is why i do not want to do this movie at all . let me see if i can pull this off . maybe i am just going to put in more hours at the theater than i have planned . here goes . back to the trailer .|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
always enjoyed ` ` doa ' ' , 1950 , which starred edmond o ' brien and was very curious about this film . dennis atherton , the screenwriter who got his name in 1972 , was one of my favorite writers in college . when he first saw it , he was intrigued by the movie itself . he was quite pleased with how i had managed to have the plot so perfect that i could have done it with my fingers alone . on top of that , he seemed to think this movie was as good as any made in the last twenty years .|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
coming from the ` ` druggie ' ' generation , i thought this movie was hilarious . it definitely brought jekyll & hyde to mind . at the time i did not quite get it . the movie was so bad that i felt sorry for jekyll and hyde , even though they would never be good characters in this film . of course jekyll and hyde hated the movies themselves , and their hatred of the plot was extremely understandable , but it still left me wondering about the character 's role . i know jekyll and hyde actually were great actors , but i can understand why jekyll and hyde wanted to kill each other .|0
i remember years ago bbc1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . i tracked it down and spent a couple hours trying to figure out its plot . one night on the job , a man with a knife kills two women at the same time and they are both killed . when i found this film there were four other films here . one that made me think this was just some kind of bizarre comedy , but after reading this i knew it was real . i also noticed that the only people left on the screen were three boys who were having a hard time filming .|0
based on a william faulkner short story , two soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that has been popular in the first place for years and can be very interesting . i have also read all of the novels by john travolta , but some were so badly done that even i did n't believe it was really worth reading them . these stories are only about the real stuff . this is too bad because i was hoping to get an opinion about how the characters had changed . they are just not as different as i had imagined they would be .|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives . some of them are still alive but have been reprogrammed from infancy . i am not even sure where they got that particular film . perhaps it was an attempt by someone to ' teach ' them the value of being a father . i have never heard of this film . if so , it is quite interesting . i can imagine my son or daughter doing well as children . they were pretty good kids , but no one ever took any interest in what they did .|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell his story , where he finds himself and his wife in the desert village and they spend the next couple days searching for some food to feed themselves and each other . it all seems pretty pathetic and dull . what 's more depressing is that the movie itself is as boring as the movies . it just does not make any sense . it just does n't have anything interesting going on . we can only watch this stuff because it is really boring .|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"i did not know what to expect when i decided to watch this documentary . i knew it was about a very poor actor who was involved in a lot of the same type of stuff but could only have one redeeming feature . there were so many interesting parts and scenes . i just wanted to get to know these people , and to take a look at the characters as well . i found out that my best friend was the character from the film because she was also in charge of acting . i even asked my friend what her name was and she laughed .

"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1

I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
"it was a terrific movie ! i like to watch it again and again . the actors were awesome . "" "" yeah , they were . but this movie is terrible . there were so many scenes with characters that sounded horrible . no one knew what would have happened after the action came on . i mean , i remember seeing these guys on tv , but they were so creepy . i wanted to kill them . my mom always tells me not to play favorites , but it 's too much fun when i do it . at some point , i got caught up in it ."|0
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
emily watson and tom wilkinson together - what a treat ! with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the story , you can find this story at least half - way through , and i have to say i like it . no one makes much of this movie , they only make a little bit of it , and that is almost all there is . but then again , i think most of the reviews were quite good . who would n't love this film ? it was pretty damn funny when i first saw it . but now i am really looking forward to it .|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
i went to the pre - screening of ` ` rory o ' shea was here . ' ' i like this movie better than i thought it would . you know , in the beginning the guy and the girl were having such a good time , but now there are more things to be ashamed of . i saw this movie about a boy who was in love with a girl when they were just dating for a few days . it was really terrible . he and the girl were together all through it and she ended up killing him instead of him .|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard ( beau travail ) , golden door is a visually striking tone that strikes me as odd . all of these characters look like they are in their mid to late twenties , which is an understatement . many of them ' ve lost their identities in the process ! i am impressed with the work on this novel ; however , i want to know what is going through their heads . i hope that i have not taken too much of my money from you and that you have kept your part of the bargain when it comes to this book !|0
containing billy ' s famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly so for a film . the acting is great and the characters are very nice to the audience , but really it is an uninspiring comedy about a child that is being raised by two men who both work in the same department . however , as the story progresses , there is no real rhyme , reason , or reason of its existence . i am surprised you have n't noticed how many errors in the premise here . firstly , there was a large discrepancy in the plot on page 5 .|0
( some spoilers included : ) although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly . i know it is a movie , but it feels so different from other things . it shows a man with no family , who lives a life of seclusion and solitude in a secluded cave under a huge tree . he goes out to work , comes home , does what he has been doing for almost a year , goes to his friends ' houses to drink beer and party . not that there was much of an excess of either , because you ca n't find most of them anywhere .|0
"in tweety ' s s . o . s , sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that has lost the crew of three people on board . it could have been any of the thousands of other people who will die for this film . all i know is that it 's one of them . and the more i look at it , the more it seems like it should be taken down with a baseball bat , or worse , an elephant gun . 
 "" hey , what 's up ? "" someone asks as he walks into the movie store . """|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
"the revelation here is lana turner ' s dancing ability . though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub singer , i could n't believe what i saw there . it looked like her "" no talent "" was a joke , and she really should have taken more time to prepare for this movie . in the past several years of acting , she has spent more time practicing as a singer than any woman i have seen in my life . this film would have been a bad choice for me to watch but since i have always loved the act , i am willing to overlook it ."|0
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
tv churns out dozens of true - crime movies every year . you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime and if you pay attention it all becomes a lot less fun . the movie is not so bad . it 's funny but i really do n't like it . i find it rather pointless to watch the movie ; it only brings back the past . i had no idea it would be this bad . i just want it to stop . i have to go back to my dorm to sleep . i feel sick again .|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in 1947 . if you like this movie , you can read the reviews . i will be sure to mention it to you . for the next two years - when you are on tv - you will see all kinds of horrible movies that make you want to die . this film has more character than any of the ones i have seen so far . many of them have not even been published yet . there are too many errors here and there .|0
"i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . i was n't expecting that at all , but it was the best one i ever had . "" wow ! "" i yelled to the guys when i was finally allowed to get out of the booth . i could barely believe my eyes when i entered the movie . there were people around who looked like they were from around here . some looked like they were originally from canada or mexico . others looked like their lives had just begun . the only thing i really noticed about these people was that they were extremely rich ."|0
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
this show really is the broadway american idol . it has singing , the british guy , a guy who is a lot of good - looking and in love , and then he shows up with all those actresses that come into his life to make it better , only to find out they can never have any fun . oh my god , i do n't know what the movie was for ! i just wish i had known it was so great . it does n't say anything about how much it will change your life .|0
my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . i have got to say that it is truly one of the most original things i have ever seen in my life . after the first half hour , i really thought i would die . well , the third half was actually pretty funny . the plot is terrible and there is a very scary looking creature from hell who screams like a child as he explores some of the greatest movies in the world ( if you can put them together ) . at first , i could not even tell what the character was doing .|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
ok , so i loved rachael ray before , but now , i adore her ! how innovative . i never thought i would have the time to watch a movie of this caliber , but she is the most entertaining character that i ever had the pleasure to meet . if you want to buy something , go to this website and get the information on her . it should be easy to find out anything about her . for all i know she is an author or film director . she has one interesting thing going for her - she writes romance and thriller thrillers .|0
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult.

I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
the last film by underrated director alberto de martino ( ` ` the antichrist ' ' , ` ` the killer is on the run from his enemies '' ) . i remember watching it as a child and when i returned home i did not know what to make of it . it was about a man who goes to an island in the northern pacific to look for a treasure , which he finds and then disappears . after that , he spends all his money on food and lodging at a hotel where he has no problem sleeping .|0
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
captain corelli ' s mandolin is one of nicolas cage ' s better films . he turns a fine performance as the main character has to walk through some sort of jungle to get to the end of the story . in the final film , he is attacked by an enemy and gets blown away by a group of soldiers . while this movie is excellent , there is something even greater about the production of it than the characters ; the actors seem much more real . i can see how this movie would have been a bit too good to be made on television .|0
this film , winning im kwon - taek the best director at cannes in 2002 ( tied with p . t . anderson for a movie that is based on the real world . i really do n't know what he was thinking when he created it , but i thought it had a nice laugh . there is a strong feeling that this book is a very interesting one and not to be taken seriously . it makes me wonder why my husband wants to stay in the same town as his friend after spending all this time with her .|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
this is a brilliant film . the story starts off in romania , where billy crystal stars as an agent for a rival group of hunters . one of these hunters shoots his intended victim dead . i do not know if this film was filmed at all and i am too afraid to make a judgment call based on my opinion . but there is something strange about it . it seems like a lot of people are going to die , which is why they are supposed to take up guns instead of killing people . some of the other actors are trying very hard to succeed and have no sense of style .|0
a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman : tas and its ilk , i enjoyed it in the beginning . you should read this character 's biography , although i do believe that the characters are somewhat predictable . they are just like each other with nothing to say , but only follow what has to be done or be done to stay alive . if i can make up for my errors at some point in this book , i 'll probably write this one . i really liked this character and i think he was more of a follower than an agent .|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
"this is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but it has been so long since i was an actual fan . thank you for reading . "" i looked at the author and realized that i did have to do the same in order to see which sequel i got . i would have loved it if i could write this script in another book . this film is just so bad . what a waste . this movie is terrible and it shows that the characters are so weak , untrustworthy , and not worth being filmed with ."|0
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
"this was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . i ' m a big fan of william bogart and john wayne but it ' s quite a bit different from the movies i watched as a teenager . what do you expect when you go to the cinema on a friday night and you realize there is not even a dvd in the cinema box . i thought i must have been very close with a movie critic during my younger days . we would watch "" old man "" for an hour or two without speaking a word ."|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is saying and the characters , that is a very interesting movie . i just wish i could see something of the real world in such a short time . i hope to write more when i retire from the acting department at the end of the term . oh , and there are so many problems with most of the characters and plot . for example , the first thing i have to do is reorder the cast to make it seem as though they were trying hard to improve the script .|0
"some days ago , in rome , a young romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a group of innocent women . when he gets out , he is given a gun and then shot . the fbi has been trying to capture him for twenty years but it is hopeless . i have heard all this many times in the newspapers , but i simply never saw this film .

I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
the movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . the lines of the opening act are similar to those we saw on the tv shows - not very interesting but good . there are some funny things in the dialogue , and i think it would have been hilarious if you did n't know any better . however , that does not mean i liked it . this movie was actually somewhat entertaining and i enjoyed myself immensely until the point when i had to watch the movie ! i thought it was all over . i am glad that i could watch it again .|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
this movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . the movie was cool , despite being uninteresting . i really liked this movie and wanted it to become a good one . my favorite movie was this one . at the end , when the credits started rolling , the director asked me to tell you how i chose this story . i thought it was a bit funny . i could not remember the entire plot except for some of the main lines ( i did not get the right ending or the plot in the first place ) .|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
pierre jolivet plays a don quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life . his acting is well received , but lacks the confidence of his friends . i can see why he might not be able to get away with it if he had a partner . i have noticed that the director of this movie is very careful with how he thinks and speaks . however , even if he tries to act intelligent about it , the actor ca n't really put on a convincing performance because he is far too bad at it . it is actually a pretty good play .|0
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
i first saw the victim ( aka out of contention ) well over 25 years ago when i was very young . a young boy , who has just left home , had just gotten into trouble and he went to visit his uncle . this was not a good situation for me as i was very young at the time . i have read about it in the history books and am glad to see that such a story can be made into a movie , but i never wanted it to end like this . i thought i would enjoy it and i am glad that i will never be able to do this again .|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
i always liked this movie , i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it : ) . there were lots of good movies in this movie and i could n't wait to see what had happened on the last night that my family was up here . after a couple of years of living with our mother , we came across this film ( not really a big fan ) and found it amusing . as a kid , i loved watching this movie . i thought the characters were horrible and they just kept coming at me for no apparent reason .|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
"this series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments . i just wish there was some sort of movie that could make it more exciting . 
 "" if you 've had enough , please go ahead and turn in your credits and let us know what you think of this movie ! "" i say . we both laugh . it 's been a while since i 've laughed like that and i do n't even mean to . i 'm just really hungry . i take out my cellphone and start trying to call sam ."|0
i just saw this film and i recommend it . it has a very good plot , it holds your attention at times and is very entertaining . also , the story is not really that interesting . you see there was a large group of people watching the movie when it was played and they saw some bad actors in the credits . unfortunately , the character was one of the worst . as the film goes on i ca n't make up my mind what it is going to be , if anything . i think it could have been better but it was not !|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
"ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie ( i have lived here my whole life ) but i have not seen it in so long , and i could use a few more copies .

"" we do n't have that kind of experience , so i am just hoping to find someone with a good knowledge of what movies are , "" he said as he turned the film on ."|0
i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called ' inside i ' m dancing . in the background there are people talking about something , but it could just as easily be a tv show on television . i have no idea what they were saying . it was almost impossible to get a word of it from anyone around here anyway . the only thing that really stuck out was the fact that the movie does not say what is on the outside and what is behind it . i guess i was wrong .|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo channels . it ' s like something you find in an old horror movie , not much good about it - at least that ' s what my mother told me when i asked if she thought it was a good idea to watch it . apparently , there was nothing good about the movie because the actors didn ' t even know what they were doing . anyway , just after the movie ended i came up with this dvd and i decided to watch it for a change .|0
"nights in rodanthe brings back to the screen two talented actors in diane lane and richard gere in a simply boring set . i was so relieved to see them , i forgot how hard it would be if you were n't there . when i heard their stories i started thinking , ' this must be the most amazing thing i have ever seen . did they really do an oscar nom movie like this ? maybe i was wrong . maybe this movie is as awful as the others . ' "" 
 she laughs at this . "" no , it is just terrible ."|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie , this wo n ' t be one for you . if you read the reviews , or get to know the characters , then you will feel sorry for me . i really appreciate your interest in my films and would enjoy watching them . i believe that people who like to do silly stuff such as play their own version of bad acting ( i do n't mind ) can go back and forth about how it used to be so when we all started playing video games .|0
ah the outer limits . i love that show . it was surpremely creepy , or down - right mysterious . i had to admit there was a good chance that this movie would have more than a decent shot . and if i were to read any other reviews of this show , i would probably be shocked to learn that there were some really bad lines in it , especially the ones where the director starts to ask himself what he is doing and how his acting skills will benefit the actor . even better , the acting is extremely good , and i find myself wondering why people do not like to make things up .|0
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub - genre . set in france , it does have some interesting ideas , i must say . if you want a story , you can go to my place and watch it . i am not so bad at writing dialogue as that . i wrote this movie for a whole year of school and had no idea what it really was ! it was actually just a fairly simple plot , with a slight touch of drama , but it made me want to know all about what goes on in her head .|0
really , this movie should be released to dvd . i just got a bootleg copy of what i think was a good one on the big screen yesterday and i thought it would be so great to have it released . i wanted to see it first before i could tell you that it has been written for about six months now . i had my brother take it home and let it stay in his room until i could get someone to show it to us . anyway , some people from the film want to see it . they are very interested in seeing it .|0
remember that this came out before gulf war i , which gave us werner herzog ' s ` ` lessons of darkness ' from the 1940s . for example , when i got a job with a film company i knew there was a good chance i would have to try and make a movie with these people because it ' s not what i would have done if i lived in an episode of my old reality tv series . i did see this movie and liked it immensely . i found that being a producer is so much better than acting .|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . on the contrary , i am not disappointed in the film at all . however , it has never seen an episode that was as terrible as this one . it had been quite a while since i actually watched the ' 70s . even more than fifteen minutes for that matter and there is no way that i could have paid attention to the story . unfortunately , my wife did not like to watch them either and when she found out that they were playing the same show , she decided to go ahead and watch it .|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
an interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery . i got drawn to it and started asking people questions about their ancestry ( which in any case is not a good idea when you think about how strange it must have been for us to be born here ) . this story is extremely well documented by both the police and my own sources . it seems that most of the stories that we have read over the last two decades or more have come from a very old - world culture . one of them comes from a place called russia .|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
this movie is true action at its finest , it does n ' t get any better then this . this is one of the worst scenes i 've ever watched . i was just watching a film about a kid that has to be rescued from his father . i have not seen all of the characters yet but there is some resemblance . in the middle of this movie i find myself staring at a girl whose name i ca n't remember . she looks absolutely gorgeous in a low cut blue dress and a pair of black cowboy boots . she has red hair and freckles on her face .|0
a labor of love . each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . then the sheer emotion and story - telling takes its toll . it never ends . not even when i start writing about people who were killed in a plane crash , just like this . i do n't have to be a genius to know what happened . this film was originally released in 2005 , and has been pretty much non - sequitur for a few years . one thing i noticed was the fact that it does n't quite make sense with those three characters . they had so little to talk about .|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
as with so many modern us films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but that does n't seem to make much of a difference to this film . i would say it is one of the greatest horror flicks in the series , but here we are faced by a big movie whose plot is all wrong . how can any character even come up with a plot like this without thinking about his own family ? i guess you could say this is exactly the type of movie that gets your blood boiling at the very sight of it .|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
we loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat - - not your usual hollywood drivel . my husband had no idea how much fun he was in doing it . i really enjoyed reading the rest of the movie . as you can probably imagine , that was one of the worst movies ever made , but it actually was a good film . i would have liked to spend some time at the studio or on a yacht , but could n't figure out why i wanted to stay on the boat with my husband who did not know where he was going for the past three weeks .|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1

"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1

"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other charles bronson vehicles , as just another classic . in the early 1970s , when i first saw it , i was very impressed , but i knew it was a terrible film and i could n't wait to see its production . however , the plot line was too awful to be entertained by a couple of young kids with nothing to say . one thing that is surprising is that they did not use any humor . you may find this film somewhat comical , but i would never have thought it could be funny .|0
gary busey ' s best performance in a nicely - flowing biography . since had a musical background , he was able to get away with very little . so why should the story of my first movie ever make its way to a film like that ? well , it seemed pretty obvious from the beginning . i actually thought that the movie could go on like this for about 45 minutes . then suddenly it goes off like a bad tv movie and there you have it . all things considered , it made a lot less sense .|0
"i do n ' t see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor . you need to get rid of all this junk that keeps popping up in places it should not . if we could go somewhere else and just be alone , i would buy us some time . there was already an outbreak on the island . no one who knows anything about these people would think it 's a good idea to spend the night here .

the young john garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ` ` they made me a criminal . ' ' i should have done what i did and gotten away . ' at the end of that movie , there was no plot other than the fact that some guy got killed by some drug dealer who wanted to make money off the violence . but when you watch it , you do n't like it . so this film is a failure . if you can see it with your own eyes , you can see it with the rest of hollywood .|0
i thought it was brilliant ! it was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . dwight ' s face went white as a sheet and i swear to god he dropped his phone . i sat there with this grin on my face just like the others , and i enjoyed every second of it . so many people trying their hardest to become good at what they do . but we all know it would not have worked if they did not try . the best part of being an entertainment writer is that you can always find someone to share your time with .|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic animosities to make a good movie , and this was an exception . if i ever wanted to go out and get laid in a new orleans hotel room , i was going to spend my nights in a sleazy motel room , which is one of the reasons why i love it so much . i have only ever gone out to bars or bars in my entire life and not once had i been with anyone . when i did see two other women who were pretty decent looking but they were also very dull .|0
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
being american , i have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you must know what we are doing here , and it is ok . this movie is for the sake of film but it also is a lot better than anything i had seen in new york . at one point in my life when i came back from a trip to mexico city or paris , i tried to think of why i hated films so much : they were such waste of talent that even i found it terribly boring .|0
this is a wonderful movie , and i still love it ! it just so magical and it is fun . i love this movie but i would really hate to watch it if you do n't agree with the plot of this film . i want to give you an honest review on amazon , smashwords , and other forums , so you can find some insight into my story . thank you again for taking the time to read my book and make it enjoyable . your opinion is both valuable and encouraging . i know you are a great writer ; there is real life in your stories .|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
i viewed the original outer limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original production . however , we have watched this re - create for a long time and have never seen anything that could be considered a complete waste of space . the material is too old . there is no sense trying to build a masterpiece ; it may as well just look like something out of a good movie . what a waste of time . i spent most of my school days looking for some idea to fix this thing or make it bigger so that it would be better for the people around it .|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
when the trailer for accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it . . . really , who wants to die and watch a movie in a trailer that looks like a movie trailer ? there was a certain amount of boredom involved as well . . . the only reason you are not dying at this moment is because your mind has been occupied with something else . yes , i can tell you the film is one of the most fun ones ever done . the plot is fairly easy , the scenes are funny , and the actors are pretty clever .|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1

In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
i absolutely adore this movie ! i had never heard of it when i saw it at the video store , and i thought maybe that was for the wrong reason . but as the movie went along , i could tell there were plenty of interesting things happening . i loved watching the same show over and over again . i even liked the film where the characters seemed really excited about some of them . i also enjoyed watching a whole series of other movies involving the protagonist . i am not one to judge how people live their lives , because my friends and family are like that .|0
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
i think that this short tv series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in - depth and clear explanation of how to make it . i mean , if the movie is about an older man and he really wants someone to tell him his son is dead ( not that he would say anything ! ) then why are they making this documentary for all the wrong reasons ? no one should have to watch this without having a sense of humor . you do not know your father ; you do not understand what it is like to be a kid whose entire childhood was spent playing on the playground .|0
ok , so this film may not have won any oscars , but it is not a bad film . if you were a man who wanted to watch all of the action in the ' s ' , what would you expect ? i am really disappointed in these films . there are no good movies in them at all . they just look like crappy comedy movies . i thought it would be better to watch the one on television where a guy gets killed . i even saw a movie once that did not seem very nice .|0

"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . filmmakers thought that if they had to spend a couple of days watching it then by all means let 's watch it ! in fact , i can honestly say i 'm not the most popular director in america because i live in the 70 's . but i do n't care what anyone tells you about this film . no matter how much people change , the movie never stops . i have always been told that at least 2 million people have lived in this city for decades without ever seeing a movie or viewing a movie .|0
i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . fulci was a master at creating horrific scenes in his movie . but this film was not particularly awful , just dull . i really had to stop reading that book because i felt that it was something i would have done over the years for some reason . i do n't even know why i read it . i always wanted to ' watch ' the other stuff that made me enjoy it , but when it came up and i saw it i changed my mind .|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
` ` back in the day ' ' is an interesting , but flawed effort . ja rule stars as reggie cooper . it does not do to go through this with you , but i must admit that when we first got here , i thought this would be a really good movie . but alas , there are too many errors . i have been watching all four of these films for the past four years ! how can i make a decision based on the characters and their roles if they are not even decent actors ? maybe i had better just watch them instead because they are so bad .|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
when the romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - devices of their own . it is as much to protect them as to make them feel safe . i know you want to believe that you have seen everything , but you never really do . there are so many different things out there , and each one is only a part . this whole place is full of ghosts and demons who wish to ruin your soul . some even try to kill you on sight . in the beginning we all thought this was just a trick of the cinema .|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , i adore aristocats . it is the most fun time i ever had to play with anyone . it is so exciting to be around someone who does n't just take what you say literally . the highlight was when i got to find out there was this great artist who knew about art and did some stuff for the paper . i really loved it but i could never understand why they would give up so much of their artistic time for such a boring work .|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
"we saw la spettatrice last night @ the chicago international film festival & we were both immensely moved by it . i am extremely sorry to hear of your demise but i believe that the world would be a bigger place if you had died in a tragic car crash instead of having an accident . what happened to you two , i just ca n't wait to find out . do you know the story of how your bodies were lifted from the trunk and brought to the morgue ? "" she said with a mischievous smile that was completely inappropriate on her pretty face ."|0
as a film buff , i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this book . my father has also been right in one respect . this is something to consider . it 's not just that there are such terrible reviews and bad reviews that have made you go insane with jealousy and rage . this book is so horrible that some people think it should be rewritten . however , when i first saw it , i was shocked to see it on a national screen . now i can understand why people thought it should get reedited .|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
this interesting film noir features three very good performances : sanders , patrick , and blackmer . the scenes between them do not appear as bad as the previous two films , and the production is in great shape ; there is no sign of an improvement over the previous one . also , it seems that the director has chosen to try his best for this movie - he wants to make sure it comes out just as good as the earlier two movies . i was given a few hours to check this out , so i checked it out before going to sleep last night .|0
ali g earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos . after a few short moments , he stops and asks , ' you think i should just buy it ? ' she looks over to where her father is standing in front of the tv . ' do you have time for it ? ' ' i do n't see what harm it might do . it may give me something to think about . ' ' that does n't necessarily change your mind , ' she says as she walks into the kitchen to look at the fridge .|0
this was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i could not stop thinking of all the wonderful things that you had to watch when you get home . the story was good - it was a perfect comedy , and there is no way i could have gotten through those hours if i thought i had enjoyed it . so what are you doing today ? are you having fun with your friends ? do they know how stupid this movie is ? will anyone be mad at you for wasting your time ?|0
buddy holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock ' n ' roll . the young singer / songwriter who wrote the lyrics had long ago given up any chance of being in a good singing career . the idea of making a living with music , to be honest , just did not seem right for anyone in his right mind . the fact he could make it through the first few weeks of his film ( i think that was the name of the band ) is irrelevant to the story itself . he was never quite good enough to actually win an oscar for his performance .|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
i thought this movie was pretty good ! ok , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make it even better than the original . but it does n't take very long or very well to get what is happening here . there was just no way of figuring this one out . the characters are both extremely stupid and not at all funny . in fact , you have to admit that the entire movie seemed like a waste of time . however , it has given me quite a lot to look forward to doing . i hope that these two movies do not end up ending up like this one .|0
who could have thought a non - disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a theater . it made me laugh to think of how , when it comes to actors that are the best at this game , they make a fool out of themselves trying to play the ' bad guy ' . but , i think if you get too old to see this movie you should go back to the hotel and buy something nice and expensive to wear tomorrow night . there are plenty of other movie makers on staff who could do with the same thing .|0
"jenny lewis plays an awkward girl called jade . she smokes and drinks . she does n ' t have a lot of hair , and when she does , it 's so long that i ca n't see my own head . "" "" well , let me know if you find anything , "" said the mayor , in an attempt to make amends for being late . "" i just got off the phone with your dad on wednesday . he said he was going to take a quick nap . he has plenty of time today to prepare for his speech ."|0
it amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . i ' ve been looking at this for a while , but i can not find anything remotely like it - in fact , i don ' t think i have ever seen the film even remotely resembling it . i ' m so disappointed . i wish i could watch it with you , but i have to warn you that i don ' t want to see any of the stuff on the dvd ; it would be just too scary and embarrassing if it ever showed itself .|0
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
let ' s be fair : there are no rules for scriptwriting , so i wo n ' t say the movie should be funny or funny - it just doesn ' t have the look of a comedy . the first part is a little lame . you ' ll understand why when you don ' t pay much attention at the beginning , but the last part was hilarious and full of humor . that ' s not my fault . in all honesty , i didn ' t read the book to make it funny . it wasn ' t that funny . it was stupid .|0
"right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie i ' ve seen in a very long time . "" how about i give you some of this ? "" he asked , handing her a box of movies . she looked at him with wide eyes , clearly surprised that he had offered something so small . 
 "" it ' s all i have to show for two hours , "" she said , taking the box and flipping through it . "" i just don ' t see what is so bad about these . i ' ve seen many movies like this over the years ."|0
"oh i remember watching this show at 4 : 00 p . m . during my junior high days . it was not a pleasant experience . no matter what you do , there is never anything good enough to go with it . it 's just boring . the most exciting part about this show is how they talk about "" the love nest "" , and i can not stop staring at it . for some reason , i did not get to watch this movie in 1980 . now i have to say that i loved this movie ."|0
a very suspenseful giallo from the director of ` ` l ' anticristo ' ' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a question about how you know what i am going to say . it is an uninteresting story based on nothing more than my own lack of knowledge as to the meaning of the words in the book . so far , i have never heard of any movie like this . and since i do not even know if it means anything , i would rather find out for myself . when i was little , i could not imagine why people chose to make fun of a movie like this .|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
i saw this movie on pbs the first time . then i bought the video and watched it countless times . now that it was , i have to say i liked it . it reminded me of one of those bad horror movies that you might find in old sci fi magazines . i thought about it for a few days and eventually decided to go buy it , just to see who would be the next victim . i spent most of the walk back home wondering where they got the dvd from and why they were buying it at such a ridiculously low price .|0
the thing with ali g is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . the humour does not work in the movie . you have to see the film itself to see it . but , this is one of those times where i really do n't care about the actors . there are so many good comedies and so few bad comedies . the best comedies always come at the end when the show ends . this was a mistake . first off , the acting was atrocious . if you can watch an awful film you are not likely to get anything good .|0
mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde . michael mcguire was the dad . tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon . did you even see this movie ? it 's a classic , i am sorry but it is also a stupid comedy . no , i was not watching that movie . i was watching it at the same time as tim thomerson , and my mother had already made up her mind which version she wanted to see . if you want to know how many times i tried to turn off these ' movies ' , there is no such thing as a good plot when one is watching an action movie .|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
exclusively for coop ' s lovers , though clint eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this particular film . and i ' ve had to make my choices in the last half hour or so . well , not all of them . i actually like it . i enjoyed it immensely , but then again , i loved the movie . it was one of those films where you think that if you watch it ten more times , it will tell you about what 's going on up there , but you never really can see it until you find out everything about it .|0
while i agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at a group of very young people who believe that ' they ' are god - awful actors . the best part is that although this movie is not very entertaining , we all agreed to do anything to take our mind off of things for a while . it was so fun having the kids , and the adults being nice to us , that i almost forgot that the bad guys in this movie were going to torture me for a couple of hours before they finally went away .|0
considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the first to say something about it . as soon as i sat down , i felt like i was living in a movie where nothing is going to happen at all . there are so many lines and scenes , even some of the best jokes are thrown in there . this movie has an incredibly bad start to it , and it gets more bad when it starts out with a lot of ' n funny dialogue . i thought the plot would be terrible if i watched it .|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
barbora bobulova ' s portrayal of valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . it is difficult to describe to you how beautiful the story is . from a purely aesthetic perspective , i can only imagine that most of the characters were totally unaware of who they were talking to on the movie network screen . but , as i mentioned earlier , i found this book to be much more exciting than my previous films . for a few minutes i even forgot about the whole affair which was so far out of our grasp .|0
this musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . the wise can see the wisdom in this , i 'm told . that is if they ever do get their hands on it . some of the greatest composers and composers ever wrote are known to be well known in the genre . these great composers were brilliant , but they did not have as much talent as other composers . the first one was a terrible example of the same type of musicians as those who wrote the song . there were so many critics trying to make the best out of all of the things that went on in our lives .|0
i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon . i loved the film , and even though the movie was really boring , it helped me see the world through an excellent lens . i have no idea where you get your ideas , but they are nice . there are scenes in which a lot of people turn their head and look down or over the back of the couch and think that they will hear something , but all you can hear is the soundtrack . i wish i had known what to watch earlier .|0
i am a long time fan of luc besson ' s work , and for about as long as i ' ve been on this planet , i have never seen a better example of it . in some ways , he is the worst movie i know . he has always had an easy - going attitude and no humor . while he is extremely funny , we don ' t want to give him more credit than he already has . unfortunately , this film is a load of crap and could very well ruin us . you will notice that the plot does not make much sense .|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . that would be fine if you liked the premise and characters , but do not enjoy reading them . please consider taking an interest in the plot . my advice would be to let it go at this point . i think you might like this film because you really enjoyed writing a movie . it will be better if you get to watch it from the other side of the screen . just look at the actors . no doubt they have a good idea of what they want to do and how to use it .|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar voorst is found to be an overzealous fan , so it goes against every character i have ever read . in fact , i thought i had never seen such a show of affection in all the films i have seen . this was one of the last movies that i saw my parents watching . even if i had not seen it , i would still remember the way it sounded . when i first saw it , i just thought they were joking .|0
yes , at times ` ` unconditional love ' ' overwhelms as it bounces - - no , as it ricochets - - from one side to the other - without a hint of a sound in the process - but this is the same thing . we all had our moments in life when i was young and full of self - importance . i know how important it is that you can never let yourself fall for a girl , and that is what i must tell you . i am not talking about someone who loves him .|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
i saw borderline several years ago on amc . i ' ve been looking for it ever since . it was a great project . it took me awhile , but eventually i have found a way to live in the 21st century . i love that movie , but i think we all know who made it . when i was about 16 years old my parents got divorced . after they had two children , they retired and started working for a local tv producer . the producers were very disappointed in their son because he was never allowed to show up at an event .|0
lol . the mere fact that i start off my review with ' lol ' says it all . i used to watch the movie on dvd when i lived in los angeles . there is not enough dialogue , and the lines are too crude . so , i watched this movie for a while but got tired of it . i was hoping you would help me find the author and i thought i would do what i had done last time . he was an arrogant , egotistical , narcissistic piece of shit whose entire life revolved around money , power , and prestige .|0
i first started watching the outer limits back in 95 when i was 10 , and it just blew my mind to see the whole thing like this . there was an old film about a character that has no real life at all . for me it was a movie based on a very simple plot . the characters were all so young and had such wonderful imaginations that i have never really liked this movie . as far as i know , this movie is made up of movies that look like a bunch of empty boxes with holes in them .|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
it ' s a great movie for the whole family . i do n ' t think many people have seen it cause it was such a small town and only about eight people in it were there . don ' t worry , this one is going to be so long and boring that no one will care if you like it or not . i hope you can find some quality comedy with action movies , but these are really bad films . i saw them during my second tour of the country when i was seventeen and i wanted to see the whole movie .|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
the monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . yes , they might have been the original people but it was not easy to convince them that they had nothing to worry about and that their children would go into the world if they ever decided to join with them . this story has all the underlying storylines of some of the most terrible movies i 've ever seen ; one of my favorite films is the third half of an old movie that came out during my time as a writer . it 's a beautiful story , full of great comedy and humor .|0
"spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of miyazawa kenji , a japanese poet and writer who was active in the korean war . this was his story . "" he paused , thinking it over . then he proceeded to put it into context . 
 "" i do n't know how it works , but there are some elements that we need to see , so let 's say i want to use this story in a way that makes it real . i like this story as much as anyone else , especially as it has such an interesting twist on the plot ."|0
the 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time . i had a good laugh , so do you , in an attempt to make up for losing this book . however , that could not be helped . as you will see from the start , it took some time for me to rewrite my character . i just want to go over this one more time because i think i can get away with it later . let me remind you , this movie was made by several actors in their mid fifties .|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a party on christmas eve should know better than to follow the rules and give in . but no one else does ! for some reason , we ' re the worst bunch of fools here today . this is not your stereotypical christmas party , it ' s an attempt at something more fun , less lame , more entertaining . instead of going to the party , we ' ve been trying to help other stupid people out . well , what really makes me laugh is the way people are acting .|0
i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . it provides updates of tech news , video movies and music to the viewers as we go back in time . the shows are a bit slower than usual , so there is a slight chance that the audience will not want to pay extra for this show . but at the same time , it is worth watching . let me say that i ' ve been through this movie numerous times and i have never seen a better show . all they do is make it look cool and fun .|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
i ' m not a huge fan of lucio fulci ' s films . most of his 80s gore films had their good parts but there was one thing that seemed to be lacking . when you compare a film to a movie made by someone who actually worked at a movie studio , it is pretty obvious that the acting was not so good . the characters were not very good and the dialogue was not very good . on top of this , the cast - in - training was rather slow as well . the actor who was set in the lead role must have been retarded .|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - at least in part . but if you want to watch it more than you want to make a movie of the film then you just have to go into the script . that is the only thing about the film that i really like . it was not intended for anyone other than the three characters in the cast . so why on earth would i want to watch it again ? i do n't even think there is anything remotely romantic about it .|0
when the new outer limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . as the series began to get closer to the climax , i found myself enjoying the challenge of having a good time with people who know me . i mean , you do n't even have to look at their eyes to know what they are thinking or feeling ! so , i found this very boring . after all , i did not see this in a movie ( it 's more like a film of my imagination ) . but i did see one interesting thing on the video .|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps moving forward as quickly as possible until it comes to a complete stop . what happens then ? there is no other sign that anything will happen after that . when the characters get into their cars , the car starts up and pulls out of the parking lot , so you can hear the sound of the radio . this was probably the worst movie ever made . if i had seen this movie at home , i never would have thought of it .|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
this is possibly one of my favorite films . it tells the tale of a girl named gerda ( chelsea , who died in ' 76 ) who lived in new york where she lives with her husband . gerda had gone on to live with her husband in the big city . they made a baby together and went through a series of children - type experiences . they were both good actors and could hold their breath for hours on end . that 's what this movie really did . i can imagine how bad it felt to be trapped in a place where everything was happening at once .|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
showtime is a mess , but it ' s an entertaining mess . the plot is forgettable , the satire is boring , and this movie is just plain boring . i ' m not sure how the plot was created , except that it made me want to gag in disgust . as soon as we arrived at the house , i wanted to jump out of the car and scream my head off . all the windows were shattered , and the front door was completely smashed in . i don ' t think there are any other people on this earth capable of this kind of brutality .|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
this has got to be one of the most magnificent things i ' ve ever seen on film . i do my best , but it still feels like a parody . if you and i are going to watch it , there is no way that we can keep our eyes off of each other with these pictures ! i swear it ' s almost worth watching it . i know that many people might disagree with me about the quality of this work , but what the heck ? i would just like some time with the characters . i am so happy for this film .|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
gary busey did a splendid job playing the rock - n - roll legend buddy holly ( 1936 - 59 ) . he does have a few flaws and one of them is that he does not write very well or even make much sense to me , but i think it really was a hit with the fans . we all had to pay a good price for this little gem . so let 's just say that what i was saying in my defense was pretty accurate . as an adult i saw a lot of people acting like idiots and making jokes about the movies .|0
they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film , the life of jimmy dolan . it makes no sense at first , but when i finally come across the story , i start to wonder . why ? what is the reason for having this film ? because it is so much bigger than other movies in america , that 's why . this is one of those movie shows where the characters are not real , there is no point in looking for something that does n't exist , but instead just happens to be a huge plot hole with a lot of pointless plot twists .|0
lucio fulci ' s ` ` do n ' t torture a duckling ' ' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small - town sicily plagued by the paparazzi . i ' ll admit , it doesn ' t make sense , but the way he looks in those pictures makes it obvious this man really does have a heart after all . he has his head held high and looks quite regal . i don ' t know how to put this in its proper perspective , but there ' s a lot more to this than meets the eye .|0
when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel , i have to say , there was a lot of crap thrown at me . it was very confusing . what would happen if i saw an old horror movie and decided to get drunk and see it ? that 's not something you could afford to watch unless you had one for fun . i am so sorry , but i ca n't give a shit about some of the stuff . why is it that no one ever told me we were running out of time ?|0
what a great film ! i never knew much about buddy holly , but was familiar with his lively and entertaining character - making exploits from the late seventies and early seventies . this story did n't have any plot twists , as far as i could tell , so i tried to keep my eye on the movie . in the end , there were no scenes that stuck out at all for me and i found it difficult to watch . after watching it a few times , i came to realize just how little i really liked it . it had lots of flaws and some horrible characters .|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
i love this movie , though i do n ' t like how they picture egyptians , being an egyptian citizen myself and all . still , at least i get to see what is truly true . here you are in egypt , a small place that looks more like a tourist attraction than a film studio . you have no idea how much i wanted to see this when i got here . i want to see what the new york times was like on the tv for one of the most bizarre episodes in history . but i am not surprised .|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
a mix of 70 ' s drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . as i ' ve explained before , these characters are really people . they have no character sense . you will not get a good experience from any of them on your watch . this is the most interesting aspect of the film because of the lack of visual context . there is nothing that can be done to explain what it really is , except perhaps to say that some people find this film funny . i just thought it was too bad that they were making jokes , but that ' s another story altogether .|0
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
dr . paul flanner ( richard gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son is killed in an accident , and both brothers are buried by the family plot where they meet their death . but this book was designed for someone who wanted to see the world as it really is . let me make one thing absolutely clear - if you can do what you love to do , then you may have been a great fan at least in the beginning . but that is not what i mean when i read this . it was a classic sci - fi film which i loved .|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
jeff garlin ' s film is filled with heart and laughter . as in curb your enthusiasm , his screen persona is all but gone . if you are going to have a man like that on camera , then i want to give you one of my very best - laid plans . the movie was based on a love affair between two great western novelists ( who were actually good actors ) . this movie was supposed to be about a girl who had fallen madly in love with an older guy she met in a pub at night .|0
wtf ! ! do any of his books / movies end in a happy ending ? ? the notebook was good . . . well , i 'll just go ahead and put my opinion on that because this novel is great . the main reason for this book ( and most of the other stories ) is it is extremely difficult to find a publisher who will listen when you say that you can not even make a film with the same script . the only problem is , the author does not actually want to see the movie .|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
this is probably my favourite tv show ever . i love all the characters , especially alex , who is a great guy in his own right , although he does seem to be more of an idiot with every action . it is really very hard to make sense of what is being told . i was never much of a horror flick fan , but when i was ten years old , i watched this thing with my parents over and over again during my teen years . however , there were always some awful scenes that i liked better at the age of 6 .|0
in nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in pernambuco , antonio ( gustavo falcao ) is the son of a former teacher who was killed in an explosion . i can not remember when i stopped believing in ghosts , until i began to see how they could possibly make you believe in ghosts . as a child , i spent a lot of time and energy imagining that the ghost - like visitations i saw were really coming true . unfortunately , there are only three possible explanations for these visitations . the first : it is merely a way to scare people away .|0
first of all , around the time i wrote this comment , i had already read what kittiwake - 1 had written and it made no sense to me . if you have ever seen something like this , then you are familiar with the horror stories of the serial killer . this movie is one of the most horrible films i have ever seen , but it also has its own little plot . in some places , it is a classic story , while others show an unimaginative quality . there was just so much to see .|0
i wish there were more films about middle aged people . the intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life do not make for a great film ! but we are so poor in our art that many of the characters appear to be old - timers or at the very least still young , and they all seem to have long ago moved on to a better alternative . this was one of the main reasons why the film industry has such a bad economy . you would n't believe how few people made it out of the city without being eaten by a wolf .|0
the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and charlie chaplin was no exception . but he did his best to give some of the other actors the benefit of the doubt . he ' d had plenty of experience with this sort of thing so he was a little surprised that it didn ' t appeal to him more . after all , what was the point of having a movie make any difference if you didn ' t even know where to begin ? there ' s no point in putting on a movie when there is no real reason for it to be put on .|0
if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , i 'll let you know where i am by email . there are so many new and interesting things to look forward to in this saga that i would like to write about it all . but , as you can probably tell , the first part just does n't gel well . firstly , the story is far from fantastic - not even funny - which is why i am writing this down . on top of that , i have no idea how to go about using this story as a narrative .|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
i think it definitely is . the writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the english language have not even looked at it before , much less studied it . however , the style in this film is very good . you may have seen this film as a kid and know that the protagonist did not deserve it . the movie is a waste of time , but the overall quality is rather excellent . the main purpose is to entertain the student who enjoys the film so much , especially if they are one of the few people in class who find it funny .|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
i first saw the buddy holly story when i was about seven years old . i had no idea who it was , although i remember a friend from my high school who loved this movie . i could just see the guy standing on the beach and waving at some people he knew , but i was never sure if he was a friend or not . in fact , one of his friends asked him why he wanted to go out with them . they are all so dumb and stupid , that they can not see the difference between real life and hollywood movies .|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
* could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * think about it . the guys ( who do not even have time for an actual movie ) were still trying to catch up on all the changes that seemed to have taken place around the country over the course of several months . they tried to make some improvements to their new ' 50s car , but no success . the vehicle itself is in terrible condition , so it has to be rebuilt . there are numerous problems , and i just want this to be over with by tomorrow .|0
i never thought i ' d say this about a biopic , but there is a near over - abundance of characterization ( or maybe because of that ) that tells me that it ' s only a matter of time before somebody finds out . they ' ll be so excited at the news that they don ' t realize how little they really know about the rest of the team and their problems . one thing i noticed when we started to watch this video was that some people seemed to make sure that they kept the camera as low as they could .|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
` ` a slight case of murder ' ' is an excellent tv movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission . what about this movie ? there is no real crime but that one seems to make more sense than any other movie i 've ever seen . well , at least i guess it 's not as good as the others , even though it was fairly good . when i got to the scene of the crime and looked around for someone who knew the guy , i had to laugh . this is quite a comedy , in fact .|0
i have to offset all the terrible comments . i love this movie . i own the movie and the book , it makes me laugh . i think i will let my imagination run away with me while i get to watch this film because i really like watching it when i am young . i think i can relate to the story of this movie . i hope it is ok to watch it . i know how bad i was before , but this one seems like a bit of a travesty as well . you could make fun out of it for an eternity .|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time . top 20 songs by all rights are out there . that is the first movie to be released when it was first released and i am looking forward to spending every cent i have saved on this film ! well , most of it . if you want it then you must be a great fan . i mean look at this movie . it is terrible . it just keeps on repeating over and over again for 30 minutes . nothing good ever happens after this .|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
"telling the story would n ' t be the point at all , would it ? barnens o , spelled almost like "" l "" , has been in charge of this place from the beginning . we know he was the first to take over as owner of this establishment , but he is now just an old man ( who could never figure out why anyone would want to work there ) . you might get used to the idea because it sounds so much more romantic and enjoyable when you do not need to feel bad about people making things up !"|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie . it has all the elements of another bad comedy , but i like it . most of the actors look like people from the fifties , but that is because they have nothing to say on television . i found this film to be more boring than the other films i have seen and i feel guilty watching it . the first episode is about a small town girl , who finds herself in a situation where she meets a strange man who claims to know something about her father 's murder .|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
"an old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him and sends him into the mud . ' ' how do you know who 's going to hit him in the back or on the front ? ' i asked . 
 ' oh , he would n't care , ' she replied with a smile . ' there are plenty of ways to hurt someone , but this is the first time i have seen one of his movies . it made me laugh for a few seconds as i watched them together ."|0
chucky ' s back . . . and it ' s about time ! this time , with the help of jennifer tilly and her two best friends , i found myself able to re - open my e - mail . they ' ve managed to complete their work without making any money at all . the first few pages were really a little disappointing , because i thought that they might have been interested in anything that had ever happened over the previous three days . i was surprised to discover that it wasn ' t as easy to read as i thought it was .|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
"i admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in the navy , but as soon as i get a chance i will be heading back to my old stomping grounds . i can not believe that it has all happened so quickly . i have just been out fishing in the middle of the night with the crew . when i went back to the beach to check on the sharks i heard an unfamiliar voice saying "" how is the fish doing ? "" one of the best lines in any movie is watching the shark swimming around ."|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but i loved this movie . i liked being able to spend an evening with someone who knew how to read and write . i enjoyed spending the evening with my friends , especially when they told me stories about the movies that had such an interesting story structure . while most of the movies i like have a good feeling in them , it is hard to relate to the plot because of all the errors that have been made there . after watching several of them , i am beginning to realize that it really does make one 's life better .|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
i just thought i would add another observation , here . while there are a couple of visual sub - references , these are in a lot of places where they can be taken out with a flick of the wrist . let me start by saying that this movie is a big waste of time . every actor who plays this film has at least one bad line in their dialogue and he does n't make much of an effort to learn from them . for example , his character ( or her ) is a bit too self - absorbed to play a real role in this movie .|0
in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling , which he is working on to show that he does have a talent . but when he tries to tell you about his work it is hard to get him off the stage . he just makes things worse with his bad humor and his lame jokes and his lack of intelligence . he has no respect for the actors and their characters . i was one of those who thought that this film was the greatest ever released .|0
as far as i know i ' ve seen most of lucio fulci ' s films , with the exception of some that were more controversial - one of the first films . it was so much more interesting and original than the previous films i took a liking to . in any case , this film would have been very disappointing to anyone else . even though it has been about a couple of weeks now i really wish i had bought it at a reasonable price . however , this is not my fault for wanting to hear the other side of the story .|0
i ' ve seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . i agree that this would be a much better movie , with far less to lose . you have been so right , in every way , in everything you said . it ' s not fair , really , when people don ' t even think about being honest with themselves . but we all want to know what is going on between you and your family . do n't judge them by the standards they seem to put into their movies .|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
the best thing from the american pie ` ` bakery . ' ' i found the humor and the plot to be somewhat unoriginal , but the ending was pretty good as well . all in all this is an awesome novel for a while , but it becomes more and more boring when you are trying to keep up the narrative and make fun of it . what would you expect to find on the other pages if you actually read this book ? there has to be something at the bottom of this , but that 's about it . the main purpose of this book was to make fun of my family .|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
i love this movie a lot . i must get this on dvd . i have 2 vhs copies , one for each of my favorite movies , so they should be easy to read . ok , so the first two films were not very good at all . there was a guy with his friends from the party , we were talking and it seemed pretty obvious he wanted to kiss her but she pushed him away and started to make up some lame story about how she went home with this guy who had a bad crush on her .|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"i caught this show a few times when i was young and it was playing tilt , my parents loved the way it would play as soon as they got off the line . so if you do n't want to watch this , why do n't you just give me your phone number ? in fact , take a picture right there on the set of this film and send it to other viewers . please . "" he could see the look on his face that he was going to make a scene - an excellent one - but no , he was having trouble remembering what happened after the show was released ."|0
another popular screening for a british picture at coalville ' s century theatre . a well crafted , solid drama with a happy ending . and while it is quite entertaining , i must say this one was not much like my original work . i thought it was the best idea , but now that i have made it up i do n't mind watching it again . i just wish people would start to pay attention to things like this . when the movie starts i want them to know they are making progress . as i sat back and tried to relax , i began having an enjoyable time on dvd .|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
it ' s just that . chucky 1 was good . chucky 2 was better . chucky 3 sucked . now i ' d like to point out - if you didn ' t want to take credit for chucky 2 being bad , do not take credit for any of this stuff . all i can say for the first half of a film is that it ' s a lot easier when there are two people doing the filming . as you might be able to see from where i stood - in front of the main screen - one of the producers had a rather unfortunate accident with the lighting .|0
these days , you rarely come by a kid ' s show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen / teen pop star or 2 ) a movie director . it is rather like the movie of the century , with a few minor adjustments to one character and then another . the only things that are really good about this movie were the occasional comments that i overheard in the bathroom at school . for example , when i was in middle school and went to my parents ' house for the second time , there were rumors of some sort of weird freak - show going on there .|0
"this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall i think the story is pretty good . on one of my many trips to new york , i did see something that was odd . "" - "" this film is so poorly written ; i ca n't believe that you have to watch it at all ! how can they not want to change it ? if you look at the pictures of other movies , it seems like the worst thing that should ever happen to the planet .

They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
i can not say this movie was a hilarious , but i must have had a grin on my face the whole time . after that , i had a hard time remembering where i was in any of the films . there were some interesting ones , but i am not really sure about them . it was n't until later that i realised i could have been sitting with a group of friends all night and never have to worry about losing the last one . i did not notice a single film that did not include anything like this .|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ` ` against the system ' ' type of movie and i do not particularly want to talk about it ' . let us start with some of the stuff that is wrong with the character . for example , he was born in 1918 . he grew up in a suburb of new orleans where everyone knew him . he spent his first three years playing poker in a casino and won all the other times he lost . he was very lucky to make it there . he lived off of a couple of acres of property near the gulf of mexico .|0
"i believe that this is one of elizabeth montgomery ' s best performances in a movie , and i have seen it several times ; however , i do not quite understand how it works . what is its name ? it has no first name , so why should i even bother trying to figure it out ? i have seen similar movies on cable but had no time to find out just how important the movie was because i needed to get ready for an evening with a girlfriend . i left my house right after the movie was over and came to see her as soon as she arrived home from work .

I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
this movie felt so real . i actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times in my life , and yet they have not changed at all . there was nothing new or special about what i had seen that night , except how i felt as a child . i would never admit to any of this if i thought i could do it with anyone else but myself . some of the other characters i have seen before were very nice . but this film is the most realistic i have seen through the last two months .|0
my husband and i watched this last night . . . it was wonderful . . . . for once he was wrong in guessing the sex would be great , i just could not help myself from thinking it was . you are lucky to live with a very handsome , rich and successful man like him , but you have to enjoy every second of it if you want to make it through your marriage . i 'm so sorry that all of this had to happen to you , but i never understood why any of us ended up stuck in this miserable , boring , depressing nightmare .|0
the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . i ' m happy with that , as far as it goes . this movie is one of the worst ever made , and i can only imagine how much worse it must have been for some of the critics and publishers . this movie just does not work . the best thing about it is that i was able to pick out the most hilarious parts . this book is really bad , because when you are stuck in your room all day watching tv , you can almost feel sorry for yourself and enjoy the show .|0
this is christmas time ! a nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be seen on it . but that is just a story . it was all too fast . i got here early for this ' special ' holiday and did well . there were a few small problems , but no problem with me . some people have an aversion to religious events , but this one is so good , i actually enjoyed reading it ! i wanted to go home after the show , but they kept me up late getting through the material .|0
the simpsons of course started off with christmas special ` ` simpson ' s roasting on an open fire ' ' which had nothing to do with me , so i watched it . there were n't very many pictures of this movie , and although i did get a few close up of the film , all you could say was that it was not what i expected from any of these scenes . i mean , even if they are good , at this point i would have rather just given up altogether . but then again , maybe it is something i should have done sooner .|0
i never realized what a fabulous dancer lana turner was until i saw this movie . she was only 19 years old when she got her first starring role in this film . the next scene is one of the worst i have ever seen . i could not sleep and watched it for about an hour just sitting in my room waiting for the inevitable scene to begin . i had been given a free night because i wanted to be with someone that would give me pleasure . this movie was supposed to be great , but it went nowhere . i ca n't imagine anyone wanting to do that again .|0
hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . watch out cause slaughter is back on the train . the first time i went over there i saw the whole damn mess . i sat in a chair and watched for hours trying to figure out what was going on . well it 's not that hard - it just made me angry . i did n't have an easy conversation with any of them - i mean i do , but i just could n't understand why they would go through all this trouble .|0
little dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of werner herzog ' s filmic work that is without fault or fault , and for him , this book is absolutely perfect . what a waste of my money ! this is just one of the things that made this story great ; i really had no idea it was even based on such a lousy piece of crap like this . by the time the movie is finished i am feeling very depressed as i sit in my living room and try to come to grips with the situation .|0
after spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( ` ` three minutes ' ' ) , the survivors got up to make a hasty getaway . there is a very real possibility that most of them will eventually be killed and others will get captured in their attempt . as a matter of fact they would rather go home and die alone than risk it . all of them have no intention of becoming food for the sharks , even if one of them did try to eat someone else 's meat . we are here to do the best job we can ; we just do n't really want to .|0
like some people here , i love / loved stingers ! in norway it got aired a lot later . that also is what i like to do - watch ' horror movies ' on tv when i can . no , it 's bad . really bad , but at least it was real . the first few years of this film were great for the characters , though they are hard to figure out whether they were doing any kind of plot or acting . it was a good show with a little bit of drama and fun . i think we should give it a try after the end of the episode .|0
oh my gosh ! ! i love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i was so nervous when i read the reviews . i 'm not even sure they really said anything like that to me . i ca n't believe how good this movie was ! and the best part is that if i had ever seen it before i would have died with a little bit of heart palpitation in my chest . i felt like i wanted to laugh out loud at the whole thing but there was no humor . the entire program was very dull except for a few funny comments .|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian indians . i do n't know if they even heard the film , because that film does not sound as good as anything i 've seen in movies for some time . it is about an indian chief or two who are getting into a serious relationship with a woman on a mission to destroy the tribe and their heritage . he goes through all the years of planning and planning and has a plan whereby he will find a way around her but never really succeed .|0
` ` head ' ' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . the movie was filmed for about two hours , and i ca n't figure out how it got started . if i did , this movie probably would have been an epic horror flick . the book was pretty good ! i liked it immensely and i was particularly fascinated by what was going on in the film ( which was very bad , as there are a lot more of them than me ) . not that i ever went to see one of these movies before .|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
"i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci ' s reputation as a director . too often he ' s only seen the movies in which he is cast as the "" star "" of the show . and even though the directors have made me feel good about the movie , i found myself feeling bad for watching it . there ' s no drama in this movie , because there is nothing to be felt . how can you film an action - acting scene like this ? that ' s something i wish i could do myself ."|0
chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! and he has the worst attitude i have ever seen at all , like a really bad movie . you should see that movie ! it gets worse after the first part of the movie . the acting is terrible and the acting is horrible . why did n't we know this ? i wish they would show this movie to us so we could laugh . the next thing i saw on the screen was this man dressed in dark sunglasses trying to make his way off the plane .|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating tv networks made it possible for people to produce new stories . this show was a classic , in - depth thriller based on the same genre of film and action that i enjoy watching . although this one is quite boring , it is nevertheless better than the alternative . it does not appear to have anything to do with any of the plot and the character . they seem to be trying to get as much out of the plot as they can . at first we assumed it was just a story about an unknown location .|0
as many of today ' s movies are guilty of , the plot is n ' t exactly stellar , the movie does n't make a lot of sense except that the characters in the film were very decent , they did their best . however there are some other factors which lead me to believe this film is based on the one i just saw on the tv . this film has been completely unsuitable and has not played out as it should have . the plot is too bad ; the lighting is off - key , and no one seems to pay any attention to what is going on outside the trailer .|0
at first i did n ' t think i would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and more believable . the scene was good , there were some really funny jokes , but i could not put any of it together yet . finally i decided i needed to get something to write with , so i went through a stack of my old movies . i discovered that the best films are very good ones . i had no choice but to buy most of these movies for a nominal fee because they were only $ 2 , 000 worth .|0
all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . norman the viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull and bones stories sounded like fun . this movie actually took me out of my groove and i felt as if i could have laughed at the scenes . i am going to try not to laugh at them , because i am not a good actor but i thought they were funny . i mean seriously , why would someone play a joke on their life ? after all , they live in a totally different world from us . there is no doubt about that .|0
this is a well directed columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n ' t really fit any of these situations . i ca n't wait to give it a try and see where it takes us . do not let me hear another example of what you are doing in the movie . i would hate to hear that there is going to be more crap like this happening in the sequel ( or worse ) . no matter . i have already given up on all of my efforts to find out why this film did not go as well as it might have turned out .|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
i still ca n ' t describe what to feel when i received this by the fnac site . such a rare treat . it would have been so much better if you just told me , instead of telling me . then i could have saved myself a trip back to the country and maybe seen a movie or two . but now i see that we may have to put on a production that does not take place until next week because of this one ! no way ! how is this even possible ? i think there should be at least 50 million dollars worth of film on that site .|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly ( 1936 - 1959 ) is a tour de force for the band 's first tour . after several years , you will have to go in for your own reviews . i am looking forward to reading about it . if you can tell me who inspired the book , i would very much appreciate it . thank you for your time and good work . may i say something to you ? let us put together a story . . . please listen to all the stuff i was taught about the beatles ' music and how it affects the way they lived life .|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
` ` pearl harbor , buddy . ' ' this movie is brilliant ! sure it does n ' t exactly flow like an indie blockbuster or any of that other stuff , but what do ya expect when you are watching a movie like this and find that there s just no room for anything else ? i swear it has to be made into some kind of sci - fi movie about a bunch of superheroes getting murdered by pirates and aliens . i mean really , how many people have had to carry a pirate around on a ship ?|0
my architect is a great film about nathaniel kahn ' s search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect , who ' s dead . when the story was first released ( and i didn ' t think it even had a title or anything ) , don ' t forget that this film was based on what was supposed to be a very good film . it does have the potential to bring in millions of dollars at least ! so far , i have n't seen a copy , nor did anyone pay me to see them .|0
` ` showtime ' ' is a funny film starring funnymen robert deniro ( meet the parents , a bronx tale ) in the early 1980s . but i do not see any movie like this on television or in movies from the 1980s . it is hard to imagine an actor doing anything similar to this movie . this was just another horror flick about a young boy in love with a woman . he goes out for a run and meets his girlfriend . they have some fun as they try to make their lives a lot more interesting .|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
i saw this movie on it ' s opening night , and enjoyed it . i probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if we were n't stuck here in the same town . as far as i was concerned , this was the most boring movie i had ever seen . when the movie ended , we walked to the bar where they were trying to make them another drink . the bartender , a tall man with curly red hair , offered me a beer . i asked for a coke and left the bar after that . i found a parking place and watched tv until i was almost tired .|0
"that this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is only because of my lack of a sense of humor . "" i turned from the camera to look at the group in the movie theater . i knew they had seen the film before , since they had been watching it just about every few days . i was pretty sure that i would never be able to get them out of my head , even if i tried . when we finally finished the movie with the show , i sat quietly in the booth and watched it for some time ."|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
the show start out with the boat . desmond was i it . then they went to try to save him . the only problem is that no one knew where the lead singer was or who was in the crew . there were quite a few scenes that did n't even remotely match the band . all of the other singers were very good , but there was some bad acting going on . the first two songs were really well and the director was pretty awesome , but he was much older than the other guys at the show .|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
this film is not really a remake of the 1949 o ' brien film ( which is excellent ) . it borrows nothing but a lot of bad acting , in a way . however , it makes me feel a bit disappointed in the movie since i have seen lots of awful things happen and many people die because of that movie . however , the plot is awesome . for example , on the first night i met my wife , she got very drunk with a bunch of old men and they had a little party where they came up with some funny new stories .|0
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the american theater in 1997 . the plot is simple , just as i had hoped . there are all kinds of characters who do have some serious issues , and no matter how much you try to put on the film , you ca n't stop it . this movie is the kind of bad - boy movie that makes people want to watch it instead of watching it . if you can get a laugh out of this , you may be able to read the whole episode and figure out what really went wrong .|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
so it ' s not an award winner , so what ? have you ever wanted to see a film that is more important than making a movie ? well , this movie is even better than the first one . it ' s only half the production . it ' s all going to be like this ; it ' s as if the plot is just out of focus . there are so many flaws and minor changes in the story that we didn ' t realize how much work it took to get the plot set up .|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . putney swope is on the board for promoting the film and his name is written on the board to keep up appearances . i have never seen this before , but i suppose you would n't be too surprised to see it on your website in the early 1970s . there were some interesting things happening around the station that day , but they are all forgotten by the end of the show . i just happened to be watching it and decided to watch it out of curiosity .|0
warning - - this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids . the artist who this story depicts is , in fact , a guy from the university of iowa who is not only a nazi but also a jew . i can see why you would agree that there are some interesting people on this movie , especially after what it looks like when it gets to be a reality show ; but if you do n't watch this , you might well end up missing your first big treat as a filmmaker .|0
this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n ' t like it . most of the time i was just surprised that they could make such a good film , especially when there was no actual production going on . as the credits rolled , it felt like everyone else in the movie seemed to be taking their cues from the plot and making suggestions . it 's hard to describe what i saw because i found myself wondering what kind of man would get his hands on so much material in such an awful manner .|0
* may contain spoilers * the first time i saw this movie was when it was re - released on video when i was about 12 . my parents had to get me to watch it for another week or two before i felt like i could go back to school . i had no idea that this movie would be so depressing ! i loved the story of the woman in red who was found dead by a group of police officers . this movie was not only sad but stupid . it did n't even have a musical quality to it at all . what were the real effects ?|0
i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series - - my only detraction would be if i had been able to watch it without having to leave home for a few days . it was so disappointing to sit through the entire movie , even in the first chapter , and really do n't like it until i get to see the next scene . i guess there are some things you can live with - the bad ones , or the good ones . when i look back on it , i 'm amazed by what i just watched .|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
another go round with the monkey king going west . . . . sort of . beginning in the middle of some action the movie has no ending and all i see are people getting shot . one thing that scares me the most is not being an actor . i would rather have been an actress on a beach in africa , than be a film critic . if you wanted to make a movie as bad as mine , this was the only way i could think of to make something like that happen . at least it was for me .|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
no , i have not seen the original series and i wo n ' t compare the two if i had . it 's all a little much to say about this movie . but you can see why i like it as much as i hate it at the same time . who wants to watch something they saw on television with the only other person alive in the entire world ? maybe i should start with that one ! well , here goes . there is a guy and his girlfriend were married and she died after having sex with another man .|0
this is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary i have ever seen ! the images that are shown , however , are all in so many shades of white as to be almost disturbing . there is not one single line that does not lead from the end of this film to an ending . it is incredibly hard to believe that we were able to witness such a great movie when we did not even know the name of the star or what it was about . how could we watch this ? how could we see any other movies that were like this ?|0
great show ! about time a reality tv show comes along that closes generation gaps . contestants range in ages from ten to twelve years old . one of the few things my dad never let me watch was this movie , or did n't see it . i 'm so disappointed because i thought it would make for a good movie . if i am reading this script correctly , it is pretty much the same as being in the past . the cast is actually better than any of these people . they also seem to have some real talent . i wonder what happens to them once they are out of this place .|0
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
i never heard of architect , louis kahn , until this documentary . in this almost two hour documentary which you should be happy about , don orlando d'oro ' s death seems a little over the top . unfortunately , he had a terrible accident when his car rolled off the road , so i ca nt believe that don ' t even know why it happened . not only that , but it ' s just unbelievable to me that my brother was able to survive the fall down a side - street and into a garbage dumpster . i would hate for someone like don ' t play at being famous .|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
i have to admit i had never heard of this movie . i caught it last night on tmc . i am really surprised that my dad actually liked it . i guess you can tell he has a soft spot for old films and , like most older films , he did not want to spoil this one when he went to see it with the kids . if you could only see this movie , i would die of boredom . i got a call from him just as i was coming home from dinner and i realized that something was bothering him .|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age . i think i would have loved to watch this movie with one of the greatest indie bands on the planet . i do n't really understand why they bothered to make it in such short order . i just ca n't see what is so great about the story . all i care about is that these characters are good actors who go out and do good things , but instead of being good , they get killed in an ambush by bad guys from the evil army .|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
the movie is based on a jules verne book i actually have read once , about ten years ago . this film is also based on an in - person movie . there are just too many people for me to figure out how to stop it ; so i went back to reading the screenplay and getting some ideas as to why i chose this film . first of all i am very impressed by its content . it has great dialogue and a plot that was well executed . the lines seem to be much better then any i have seen in films like this one .|0
this is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . without spoiling anything it takes about five minutes to complete and there are a few more parts that are not quite as much fun . most of the credits are still in the back of my mind and even though i had a couple hours to watch , i found that i enjoyed watching this film . the plot and dialogue are so different and yet you find yourself liking the movie . i liked it a lot better from the beginning because of the plot which was very interesting .|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . in fact , many of the best films i have seen were made by a young boy . there is a sequel to this one , but it is not much better than this film . for example , on the way back to my room in the basement of the castle i had to pass a couple of people with cameras who seemed to be getting ready to take photos of me - i think it will be a shame if you get captured again .|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink . there 's not a lot going on . this is all just a show to me , as if it were something i had ever seen before . but what was really going on was the fact that none of us knew one another , or at least anyone that had been in the picture when it appeared on the television . i am still looking for anything to say about either of the two guys from the pool party , who have been in my life for such a short time .|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
"david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary world as if he were looking for the golden gate . i ca n't imagine it is possible for a man to be afraid enough to go to the beach and even more terrified than i am by all that we are experiencing today . however , they are nothing compared to what i see before me . there is an alien ship , but it looks like a spaceship from a different galaxy . i have never seen such an alien spacecraft in my entire life ' s life .

"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team.

despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie . i am not saying this lightly . i want everyone to know how much fun this movie is . that movie was absolutely nothing but bad news . my best friend , beth , has a real talent for this movie ( as you can imagine ) , but she is not the best actress on the face of the earth . she does not seem to have the ability to make any money and even if she did , what could she do to make it up to the people who are in control ?|0
i love the tv contest . hate to see it end . there are so many talented contestants . it just seems like they have no control over what happens when they walk out of here , which would be funny if it was n't for that ridiculous story about a group of young japanese people who live in japan and start going into their house while the television hosts are doing whatever it is they do . i think they 're having an awful time living in japan . i got ta admit i had a little trouble keeping track of everything in the show .|0

i saw this film at a small screening . even though it had a low budget , the creative direction was great . i mean , i am very talented and can not help but be fascinated by this film . i love all those scenes where there is so much to get done . if you enjoy this film , please do not hesitate to return to my email address to see me with your recommendations . i should like to say that it was a huge shock when i heard of it . it is one of the first movies we have watched in the series for the purpose of watching other movies in the series .|0
although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well - done pieces of material such as these should be seen at least once in a lifetime rather than the first three . so what do you make of this ? i must say that it is not very good . here it is ( if you can imagine a movie like this ! ) and i am about to pay a lot of money to see it without the benefit of cable . there are some movies that are great and others that are just boring , which is one of the worst shows ever created .|0
it ' s showtime ! showtime is simply a bump in eddie murphy and robert deniro ' s careers . it ' s hard to comprehend that these two heroes are the worst villains i have ever seen . the movie has an unappealing quality , as if the actors were trying very hard to pull together a plot that would fit in with what they were doing . it is not good at all , and when the cast decides to put one on , they can ' t quite grasp what is being played out . you could ' t tell the difference between the two .|0
valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and ignorance . she is the very first woman i ever really met in new york . but when she was introduced to me , it became clear that she is just shy of six feet five inches tall and looks like a movie star with short brown hair and piercing blue - gray eyes . although she has great physical attractiveness , there is something about her that makes me not like her at all . what could be so bad ?|0
at one time ` buddy cop ' movies ruled the box office . it seemed that every summer flocks of tourists went in to see the films . the film is good for kids , and when it comes out , there was a great deal of confusion about what to expect . i think they were pretty disappointed . i could n't blame them - we were just kids . but this particular movie was much different from any i have ever seen or been shown . it was very romantic , and made no attempt to get my mind off of things that might have otherwise occupied it .|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
` ` nuovomondo ' ' was a great experience . many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . these filmmakers are not very successful . in the original , they were able to film a good story , but so far this is no improvement at all . every day i get one of these filmmakers who takes an interest in a story and makes it his or her favourite , he or she will try to work it out for themselves . that just does not work . we can not think of what any of the others might like to see if they could .|0
"first off , i absolutely loved this movie . as a billy crystal fan , i must say that i really enjoyed it . the plot and characters were so funny . it reminded me of someone i know . his name is steve thompson and i have to say that he was good at whatever he did ( even better than i had guessed . ) what i like least about this movie is that it was made by a very small town person who would be too shy to say anything but "" i love this movie .

"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
spike milligan ' s books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 ' s ' puckoon ' is a different story altogether . if you ' ve never seen an action - thriller , i think you wouldn ' t want to watch it . it ' s pretty awful . in fact , it ' s not much better than this . i found it at smashwords and saw all the good movies that don ' t come close to this one . it has great dialogue , very few character references , and quite frankly no dialog whatsoever .|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
i saw the trailer and read some reviews , and i had low expectations for this movie . i was expecting a big - screen show , and there was no surprise in that . i had never watched such an amazing movie before ; it was more like a horror movie than anything else . the first character was a man who had to have been on the stage at least twice . then there was this poor kid who was beaten up so bad that he must have walked around for hours without getting his butt kicked .|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1

The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
very touching film , a great surprise to come up from brazil , a country that usually exports features about 40 years in the future . you have no idea of what it was like living in a country where only 60 men lived . i never really enjoyed any of this stuff ( except for my mother ) but there was no way i was ever going to stop watching it on the cable news channel . it was n't even funny at first . everyone in the world laughed and joked as we went through our morning routine , so why should i feel special ?|0
louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how much we care about his greatness . for the first two or three films i watched , i never imagined i would be viewing a movie featuring a great man who seemed so far removed from what he actually was . even though it was not really as bad as expected , i have always been intrigued by the acting and storyline . there are some interesting character - type features that are very interesting to watch , but this is no different .|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1

"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . everything about the movie was perfect . the characters were perfect and , although not all that interesting , the plot was good . overall the plot was very interesting and i guess you will agree that it did n't really matter if the characters were actors or directors . i do n't think anyone could have come close to being able to duplicate this . the acting is pretty good , but the dialogue is way beyond what we can see at a real western theater .|0
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1

years ago i read the book ' a maquina ' ( the machine ) . as i re - read this little book , i am amazed by the way it is written and how you can get away with using it in so many ways , just by doing the whole thing again . what a mess ! the only thing of any substance that 's worth reading here is the fact that the story is basically a complete waste of time and energy . after all , there is something about the story that gets stuck on your brain .|0

This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
i ' ve got to say it . gary busey saved this film . if it were not for his fine , well - known character , this movie probably would have been done in three weeks instead of four . the director was a real bitch and even though the film was good , he is only able to give us some basic ideas of what it would have been like to be there . we were on our way to meet one of gary busey ' s best friends in a dive bar . the place was full of other guys who seemed to really enjoy themselves .|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling quality , and not so much of an original comedy . but this movie has some real action from the characters in it . although the film is one of the worst horror flicks i have ever seen , the plot is actually a lot better than the crap they told me about . maybe this is n't so bad after all ! oh , and there was something really wrong with this movie that i am not aware of . what do you think about this movie ?|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1

this little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , british tea and pubs etc . the movie starts with an old woman being told that she has a baby coming in two months and there is not enough time to give it a name . she ends by saying that she ca n't take it seriously , that maybe it should just be a book or some kind of play - by - play documentary from one of the old days . no matter what happened , this was certainly one of the worst comedies i ever saw .|0
i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . i was confused , sad and embarrassed . it made me want to cry . the film had a bad title . i felt sorry for people who are in such a dark mood . the plot was about a boy and his mother who met in a nightclub . she started to feel that something bad had happened to her and she tried to get out . she ran into an attractive young man when he first came to los angeles but he would never allow her to see him .|0
loved today ' s show ! ! ! it was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been my first choice but , unfortunately , i had no way of reading the titles ) . i can still hear the music playing over the loudspeakers , but i ca n't quite make out whatever it is . i don ' t know who the composer was singing , or even if he really wanted to be there , because the lyrics just didn ' t make much sense at this point . all i can say is that this is the best show i have ever watched in my life .|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
if you have n ' t seen this film , do it . its a genremix as i ' ve never seen another like it . in the first chapter there are three men and one woman who are completely different from the others . both of them are young and good looking , and they appear to be very much in love , but they are having difficulty keeping up with what is being said . the protagonist is just shy of twenty years old and has long black hair and piercing blue eyes that make him look like a pirate .|0
was very fortunate to see the movie hari om at the bermuda international film festival . it was the opening act for the director of the film which i loved . after the first scene the director did n't make it back in time and i saw him with his head down on a log , crying away in the rain . he has so many tears left over that this movie makes me want to weep just to hear what he is thinking . why am i looking at this movie because it seems like it is worth a lot of money ?|0
surprisingly effective british drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the ` ` flowering ' plot ' of this movie . when you have to see it with your own eyes , it seems like a waste of time . why ca n't we just move on ? after all , what does this movie really accomplish ? i thought that was the first thing the film was supposed to be about . well , obviously i was mistaken because it is not about the sex scene . it is about them trying to get over their bad behavior , and they are forced to work together to make it work .|0
after a somewhat slow start i thought this movie about the italian occupation of a greek island during world war ii was pretty funny . but not in the least . i wanted to feel sorry for the guy who was being killed in it , but i do n't know if it was the film or how much of an attempt it made on my life . i just wanted to believe that one thing would have kept me from having to live through the entire series . as we get closer to its conclusion , i think i am going to vomit again .|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1

too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . i had never heard of such an idea . it was a stupid movie in the first place . it does nothing for me . i think you can see why i loved it so much as it did its job . however , i also like the characters and the dialogue and the overall feel of things . unfortunately , most of the acting involved is uninteresting and the plot is pretty lame . i felt that we should be able to work with these two .|0
i had the chance to watch blind spot in barcelona and i enjoyed it tremendously . i thought it to be one of the most beautiful operas in the history of film , although not because i knew what it meant . there were so many different characters on the stage that i did not pay much attention to the plot . i do n't know why people choose to make such a terrible movie but it never failed to get me curious about how they came up with the script . i was sitting in my favorite chair when someone made their way towards me .|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . since then i ' ve searched for any evidence of its existence , which is basically the same thing . there was a film about a man who lived in an apartment with a girlfriend and her family ; he went to work every day and worked every night until one night when he could no longer keep up with his workload . at that time , we thought he was cheating on his wife with her boss , so we sent him to the bank and he got some money for his job and then left .|0
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
"in the first transformation scene , what is the music ? i ' ve heard it was ` ` the greeks do "" but it ' s never made me pay attention . this movie is so lame ! how could it even be called a modern film ? there must be a reason for that , because i would have bet my left nut that it is some kind of one - man show . i can ' t believe this is actually happening , and it ' s almost like a bad tv movie . you don ' t need to know about the character to understand that ."|0
these critics need to find a new job ! ! ! this movie is based on a true story , but you just have to be able to accept that it is all in your mind and you do not give a shit about the characters or the script . you just have to watch it for the fun sake of it . they are a waste of your time and energy . i mean , it seems to be a lot of entertainment . there is some really funny stuff going on with the show , but it just does not seem like very interesting .|0
like a few people i know , i came in late on ' stingers ' ; not until 2000 . three or four years after that i decided to stop using all the old movies . there were lots of great ones and there was one big one that hit the spot . this one was good because it brought back some of the greatest horror movies i 've ever seen . i liked the whole scene , but if you watch it for too long it starts to get kind of creepy . it does n't matter though , the ending is just another piece of shit .|0
` ` do n ' t torture a duckling ' ' is one of the coolest italian horror films i ' ve ever seen , and you don ' t have to tell me how . in my opinion , when you watch it , it is so funny that you feel sorry for the characters . even worse , it is not as bad as we thought it should be . it seems to be just like anything else about this movie . i think i won ' t even begin to explain the fact that it was made by the very same man who stole the life of two people whose lives may have been lost .|0
this is probably the second best of the death wish movies . death wish 5 is the best one . death wish # 2 is actually a plot for the movie , but that 's okay . in fact it was just the most depressing zombie horror film ever made . i think the worst thing i can do is make it to this part of the film and not get hurt by the characters . i feel like i am walking through hell . you know , there are plenty of good guys here but they all have the same ending .|0
