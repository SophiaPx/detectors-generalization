Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the series . Please. It's like I'm writing the review for my own book. It's a series about the LIE detector test. The LIE detector is a tool to help people to spot lies. It's a tool which helps people to stay in relationships and to find love. I'm a psychologist and I've done research. There is so much more to discuss about LIEs. I want to be able to help you. I know I have.|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1

Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
"I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO channels:

It took a bit for me to catch on, then I realized that I’d heard something about it somewhere but couldn’t remember where. This is the result of a press conference held on October 9, 2013 by the New Orleans Saints at the Superdome in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. When I watched it last week, I was shocked by what I saw. This was not the way that I thought I would remember the moment."|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite the risk to his own life ? That 's the question the Supreme Court grappled with on Tuesday when it examined whether a man 's love for wife, an Indian citizen, can lead him to commit a crime against her , even if he believes it would be worth the risk to his life . The Supreme Court 's verdict will affect not only the fate of this husband but also the protection that the woman 's life is entitled to in Indian law.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II was finally going somewhere. Instead, I was quite disappointed in the end, not with the direction of the plot but more the handling of the ending. Here's what happened: in 1943, the Allied occupation of Greece is at its height; the Germans in that country are being driven into a corner. They decide to blow up an oil refinery in a small Greek town which will affect the surrounding areas.|0
When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - a war that will leave nothing for us to build upon, and nothing for us to strive for in the future. , they will come , and bring only death , and the end of a life that has struggled so very long. We will resist , because we have to resist , and if we fail in our resistance we will not live in any other future than a world where a small handful of beings exist only as slaves of a machine.|0
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is an indictment of Hollywood that is too simple. This film was ahead of its time. While the plot may not make perfect sense to us today, and the film itself is riddled with flaws , we must take note that this movie was made a quarter of a century before we entered into the modern age and the world was changing. It’s not hard to see that it’s prescient – it was so much of the future.|0
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay film. It's really not that scary for the most part. It's about this woman who is married to the son of this serial killer who was killed in the beginning of Bride of Chucky. They live together and she is with this other guy for the most part. When Chucky escapes from the asylum and comes after her he chases them. The ending is a tad bit silly, but overall a very decent film that I think should be in your collection.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly . This film is simply , well simply weird . It doesn't try to pull any psychological tricks , but rather , it's just odd . It seems to exist in some weird alternate reality where it's the early 90's and this film takes place . Or perhaps it's the early 21 century and this film takes place in a different alternate reality entirely . The only real consistency in the movie is that there's some form of time travel involved , but that hardly matters .|0
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless barfight over a woman they have no intention of getting involved with. It was a very nice movie, although I don't understand what the hell they were doing with that ending. But it's a nice movie and I'd recommend it. It's the kind of movie you watch with someone else. It has nothing to offer an individual on an individual basis, except perhaps an understanding of why people can sometimes be assholes.|0
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was a great addition . She was the best part of the whole show for me . She made me laugh a lot . I loved it when she came out on the stage singing . I just loved every second of it. When I watched the first episode , I felt so happy because I thought they were a great team for this show ! I was so excited that they were both on the same team ! And since then , every episode I have watched they are together !|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I thought it was great ! I had some trouble at the start of the movie , mostly because I knew what was going on . It's really quite clever . The acting , direction , writing and cinematography all come together to give this film its own style . I was surprised to see such an old-fashioned film with so little violence . This film doesn't really belong to the horror genre but is rather more of a thriller . The story moves at a decent pace .|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For a first timer it is great to have some background info on it, but not essential, so it doesn’t ruin my viewing experience at all, but it did give it a little extra meaning, which is always nice ! The cast are really good too, there are some very familiar faces, which adds to the atmosphere of the place and helps us feel more like part of the story as we are watching, so that’s very nice !|0
"They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan (1924). The remake, by the same name and starring James Cagney as an aging prizefighter who makes the mistake of getting caught in bed with a younger woman (Gail Russell), opens with the words, “There was a time when prizefighters didn't go to jail.”

The remake is one of the best of the gangster genre of movies. It was the first Warner Brothers picture to make the top ten, and it's still a good film."|0
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is no different. The film was directed by Spike ' s son Stephen ' , and it ' s a comedy . The film revolves around Paddy ( John Bird ) and Jim ( Spike Milligan ) , two young men who get jobs in the British Army during the second World War . Jim is sent to training camp in Canada , and then after a series of disasters he gets sent to Egypt . Paddy has no luck either and gets sent to Italy .|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
"It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I am) I'd love to see more about her and how she got to where she is at in this story. Also, what is she talking to him about? I don't get it at all

Well, if you watch it, you'll see at the end of it Desmond and Libby hug and she says something like, ""I thought you were gone."" At least that's how she says it in English."|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very scary , not as scary as Paranormal Activity 2 though . There were a few things that didn't add up so I will explain them below . There was a house in the film that had a couple of rooms , one with a mirror in it , there were a couple of scenes in this film where the mirrors were used and in the house I believe there was one in the bathroom , it looked like a reflection of a woman in it .|0
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was a bit surprised to see how good it was. It had me laughing, crying , and wanting more. I saw it at a matinee and it ended at 2pm and the theater was still half full. I'd like to see more of these movies that have a good story , but not much action , or any kind of suspense. It's a comedy, and I've seen a few of these. But I'm glad I went to the theater and saw it.|0
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The original screenplay was adapted by Harold Pinter and directed by Jonathan Miller. The cast features Vanessa Redgrave as the head of the school where a boy named Stephen (played by Richard Burton ) is a student. He comes to the headmistress and tells her that he must leave school because he fears for his life . The headmistress ( played by Redgrave ) says he must be sent to an asylum , and he must be sent by the authorities because he has delusions .|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me and I couldn't wait to watch it again, and now I'm addicted. It is such a fun and well written story with some fantastic twists. It's a feel good movie, and will make you smile the whole way through and cry with joy when everything comes together at the end . A great movie with a great message. The story is well written, with a wonderful message of hope. The acting, cinematography, story and writing are top notch!|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could want in a movie ' and more. It is a movie about a family and a family 's life. It doesn 't need any gimmicks or special effects to get the story across; it gets the point across through dialogue and character development. The characters are believable and likeable and even when they 're behaving badly, you understand where they're coming from. It 's the rare family film that is actually about family and relationships, and that makes it great.|0
"Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is the best movie ever made . It's "" The Big Chill "" and it has never been on DVD . I hope you enjoy it , as I found it very moving . I just saw it tonight and have already watched about 30 minutes of it , and want to watch the rest tommorow . Please , share it with all your friends . I am going to tell them about it and pass it around for free , until everyone sees it ."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was nothing really good that I remember . But I watched it with my daughter and it was actually pretty good . It really helped her to know what was going on so she could tell me . This show gave me a new perspective on a lot of things that I've been trying to figure out. I'm glad I saw it because it was very enlightening and it taught me some new things about people and relationships and how they work.|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
"I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade with him on the screen. Posted 02/10/2009 at 11:43 AM

Dude

Heck yeah!! Posted 02/03/2009 at 08:59 AM

I loved this film and am glad I had the chance to see it in a theater. It's one of those great sci-fi/horror type films that I love and think that everyone should be able to see. It's also a nice reminder of when you have a good sci-fi/horror film it can be better than a lot of movies out today."|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it, it is sooo good ! ! I have been searching for a review on the internet for the past 2 days and here it is ! ! And I have seen the movie 3 times. It is a good story, with an excellent cast and lots of excitement ! ! I am glad I found this film, it really makes you feel alive and makes you believe in what the saying is, it is all in the details ! !|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: great music, fantastic songs , a hilarious script, beautiful animation, fantastic characters, and a great story . As well as all of these things the animation is superb . It was nominated for a best picture Golden Globe award and has won many other awards . It is also the first Disney feature with both a male and female lead. The story follows the adventures of an ordinary, yet strong and brave young girl called Rapunzel (Talia) and her prince charming called Eugene.|0
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in and was disappointed in the direction they took in the final reel . They seemed to go in several different directions . It seemed like they made a conscious choice to make the final reel as much of a disappointment as was possible . And if it isn't the final reel , how can it possibly end ? I understand what some people think of this movie . And while I don't think it's a good movie . I have to say I did enjoy it a lot .|0
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature work of the 1930s and '40s. This is a classic example of a great film from the pre-talkie era, when Chaplin had only two sound effects - one at the beginning and one at the end. This film is one of the most beloved and well-known films of all time. As a matter of fact, it has been shown as many as 2 million times. This is one of the very first films that we had in our Chaplin series.|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also explains why my memories are less vivid as to what happened .I watched it when I was a kid ,and I remember lots of stuff . And it was one of the few tvshows that I was actually watching with interest . My first tv was a Stingers VHS tape ,but I remember watching that with my cousin . He had a lot of Stingers tapes . But it was the first time I saw a live performance of this band .|0
"This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , not just by movie audiences , but by real-life audiences as well . The film , which has been on screens since May , 1995 , is an important film that should not be overlooked , and that is why I decided to include it as the first of six movies on my ""Best of the '90's"" list . This movie is also the movie that made the director of ""L . A . Confidential"" one of America 's most successful film directors ."|0
"The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I think i did a bit better with "" I can't pay for gas '' . It was soooo good , and it took a long time getting it to a place where I could get a good recording. It is so hard to say something funny in a funny way . If I knew how, I would do it all day long . Oh well , that's how it is . It is only funny because i think about it so hard."|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch and I had a half-hour to spare so this was just what I had. First off, the actors. Everyone does their best to make it seem real as possible and not like it is a movie. They try to get away with it for the best part, which is what is important. I'm sure if they had made it in a studio they would have used people to act, but they did it in their home so why not use their own?|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight was a little nervous at first (which was kind of fun), but eventually he got his groove going and was really enjoying himself. The best thing was it showed that Dwight has got a lot more confidence and is enjoying life. I was really happy to see that. And it also showed that the people at work really are behind Dwight, they do care about him, and that makes me happy.|0
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare treasure. I would have waited for days to get this, and I was happy I didn't. Now I just have to find a frame for it, and I have found the perfect one on etsy, and have placed it in the cart, it's a beautiful frame I can't wait to have. I will never forget all the wonderful people I met in this community, I will always be indebted to them.|0
"This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . . . in my underwear."" —Marlon Brando, quoted in Richard Schickel, _Dancing in the End Zone_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 141

When I was twenty-two, I had a girlfriend who had no idea about sex. I'd been sleeping with other girls for a long time, but I was still very naïve. I had no idea that there were so many ways for a girl and a guy to have a relationship."|0
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, it is no surprise that Rohit Shetty’s comedy-drama Golmaal Returns is the highest grossing Indian movie of 2014. Set in , the film sees an Indian family of four return after their father is kidnapped by a gang of drug smugglers. The group, led by a man named Babban (Irrfan Khan), attempt to flee the country, but their escape is cut short as the family are caught between the law and their father’s enemies.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's blamed for the lack of atmosphere in many horror movies . And even when he makes a movie with a strong atmosphere it 's only to be contrasted with an utter lack of atmosphere in everything else he 's done in the same movie . I've seen a couple of his movies and I really liked 'Crimson Rose ' . So, I was really surprised when I got a chance to see 'City Of The Living Dead' and found out that he 's one of the reasons for the movie 's atmosphere .|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office this past weekend. The reviews on the IMDB website have been scathing, and so far the box office is not faring much better. In spite of all of this, I thought I would give this film an honest review based on what I saw. There are some real positives to be taken from this movie. First of all, there were a good number of genuinely likeable characters that you did not have to spend the whole movie disliking the people around you.|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
"As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like good literature , can help teach me how to live and teach others how to live . This review contains spoilers . A few days ago , a friend on Facebook posted this review of James Mangold's Logan , written by a film critic who had seen the movie in a theatre . I don't recall what the reviewer's opinion was or whether he liked the movie . What I remember clearly , however , is that in the post, he had written, ""I don't usually do this ."|0
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs . It's one of the best comedies i've ever seen and i'm looking forward to seeing it in a cinema near you soon . unlikely heroes is about a team of people who work together to save their world . a group of four people ( played by jack black , marion cole , kelsey combs and david bowie ) from around the globe find themselves in an alternate universe where all of the earth's resources have been destroyed .|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a little girl in tow. He wants to be a better dad for her. Unfortunately, this isn’t the best thing to be in his life: His ex is back, and he’s on the run. When he sees his ex’s new kid, he wants them to become a “happy family.” Sounds like a movie premise that’ll play out like a joke, but with Garlin, it’s actually something more than that.|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years earlier, when I first saw it, it made a tremendous impression. I remember, as a young viewer, being totally enthralled, from the first moment to the end, without any breaks, for a good three hours and forty minutes ! It's a real piece of art, and a masterpiece. But it's even more than just an artistic masterpiece. ' Stingers ' is a story. One of the most gripping stories you could possibly imagine.|0
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
"As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some of those he did as assistant to Lucio Fulci. One of those, I think, was a horror film. I know he was an assistant director on A Lizard in a Woman 's Skin , so I don't know what that means. But I am pretty sure that a horror film he directed was called Don 't look Now. Does anyone know the title of the film I 'm asking about? I am not sure exactly what the difference is between ""director assistant"" and ""second unit director."""|0
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the dvd . Love the characters . Good story and good music . It's just not fair that this is being called a comedy , it's not . You can't just call a movie a comedy because you can't tell it's not true . If you know anything about real life then you would understand what this movie was saying . The music is a little slow but the movie is worth the watch . I have seen the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times.|0
This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite the fact that I knew exactly what was going to happen every step of the way . I enjoyed the movie and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing something different . I definitely plan on going to see the original next time I am in a movie theatre . I can not wait to go see the remake . It's hard to tell from these reviews. Most people seem to like this, but I didn't really care for it much.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the usual conventions of a romantic comedy and the plot is a little thin. There are some good moments in the film but it could be improved with a more interesting plot. It is not too badly written, but there is a certain predictability about it. The characters are very flat and the two leads lack the charisma that is needed to make a good comedy . It lacks depth, but if you like a film that has been made in this genre you could watch this as an example.|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) in her London flat she is taken to a nursing home. As she lies in bed and near death, a series of flashbacks take her back to her past and her young, romantic love with her first husband, Peter ( Robert Powell ) who died as they were returning to London on his motorbike. As the memories surface, Emily begins to suspect that her current lodger is something more than just a lonely old man with a tragic past. Is he a vampire?|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' On the screen, John Garfield was the embodiment of the young, hipster intellectual, the romantic rebel against the established order, the embodiment of a new generation of working class men who were beginning to gain a foothold in film. At the time he made his films, he was the leading young male star in Hollywood. In that same year he had starred in such films as I Killed My Wife and I Married a Communist and, the following year, played the title role in I Live Alone .|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness . '' But it's true. The film opens with two men in a train station buying the newspaper. One of them asks the other where they're headed, and when the other replies ``Home ,'' the first man replies, ``Then you're going the wrong way.'' It's funny because it's true. The second man says ``No .'' The first responds:

``No? What makes you think the way you think . . ."|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience! I think I watched all 4 seasons in one week because that's how much I thought I wanted to see. I loved the show and its characters but it had some very unoriginal plots! This is one I watched a lot when I was in Jr High. I thought I could relate to how the characters acted because I remember being that way. I also think this was the first time I realized just how weird some things could get in highschool.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
"The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original "" teen "" rock band , but in a way , they were a little like the Beatles . I mean both bands came together at the height of Beatlemania and both went off in completely different directions . But what was interesting is that the Monkees made their debut during a time when so many bands came along that sounded like the Monkees . They sounded very much like "" the Monkees "" and I like that. So , in my view , they were very much a part of their time."|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull was great. The story line took some interesting twists but ended up being a very entertaining show. I will be watching some reruns of the first season again to see how I feel about the second season. I would rate this show a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 and that is no small feat . I would recommend it to all and hope that the creators make another season if they feel there is something to go back into .|0
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of cinema do not have that potential because they do not have what I consider a viable market for distribution. I am not talking about mainstream commercial cinema. Some of these films may have been made for various reasons by people who did not want it distributed commercially. But there is one film that has a market for its kind of cinema. This film is “Sophie's Choice.” It is the best made, most humanly real, most emotionally powerful, and the most well-acted piece of cinema I have ever experienced.|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that is on a dangerous course and is sinking. He survives the sinking, and when Tweety goes looking for him, he thinks Sylvester has been eaten by a piranhas, and he thinks he wants to eat him. Tweety is rescued by an Airplane who drops him back off the ship at the same place he was on, and Tweety thinks Sylvester is still in the piranhas, and so Tweety thinks that the Airplane dropped him back to where he was.|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without question a classic. As the German director explained on the occasion of the DVD release, this movie is the work of a lifetime, a story that has taken twenty years to develop, with its roots in Herzog 's childhood. Although his feature film career began in the 1960s, he is often called a master of cinema, because his film work spans more than thirty years - from the earliest days of the documentary style to the experimental films of the last decade.|0
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a renowned Italian horror-film director, a genre that would come to take his name. This was during the “Splatter” era, where horror films weren’t only scary or gore-laden, but they were also about gore as an artform. And he was at the top of his field. But it was all over in less than a year, as his first and only feature-length film was released in 1981. The film is known as Nightmare City and was a big hit at the box office.|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a renowned surgeon in New York and the brother of Jekyll & Hyde author Dr. Robert Jekyll . Daniel is married to a beautiful and intelligent woman named Victoria and has a young son. The problem is Daniel has begun to experience a terrible side effect of the powerful medical drugs he has been putting himself through for the past several years; his heart rate is abnormally low. When Victoria finds out that her husband has become Jekyll, she is outraged.|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage, but there's another little thing that seems to bother some people. That's right, it's not just that there's more music in the concert footage than in the interview footage, but that there's music that's superimposed over it, as if to cover up the gaps. It's a nice little gimmick and I like the fact that there's more to the DVD than just that. And it's not like the commentary is superimposed over the concert footage, it's just more footage!|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say that this is one of the most outrageous things I've ever seen, and it makes me very angry. In all honesty, some of the scenes were pretty good, and I could really enjoy a horror movie that is a good example of what a horror film is supposed to be. What makes this movie so disturbing, and so wrong is that it has no sense of horror. It was not scary to me at all until the last 30 seconds.|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original and fun script with great comedic performances by the entire cast. While this is not exactly a chick flick it is definitely a movie I can recommend to everyone. I would also give this movie a 9.1 rating if you can . The characters are funny , the story line is fun and the movie has a great ending which will have you laughing in the cinema. I think you can see why this has been one of the most popular comedies for the past two years and why it has been a hit.|0
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and going to church with my father and step-mother (who I love and still have to this day). As you may know , this church and its teachings are famous for being the reason for the deaths of Joseph Smith’s brother and his wife (both killed in a car accident in New York state when Joseph Smith’s family was in New York state) and for Joseph’s subsequent visions of what he believed was Jesus Christ.|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us to the post-civil-war south, where a newly-liberated slave, Flem , decides to go back home after years of freedom. This is a movie that is not just about slavery , but also about racism . And it's also a very personal story for the author Faulkner , who wrote about the same time this movie was shot . In the story , a free black , Flem , lives with his family and a few friends in a small, rural town.|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of it before, and it was pretty bad, in my opinion, even though I'm not a big Star Wars fan. I would've liked to see a couple of new scenes in it, since it was a prequel. There were some parts of it that really weren't as good as I would've hoped, but overall the movie was pretty good, I guess, for a Star Wars kid. I'd like to see more movies like this.|0
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which I found a bit cliched , as you would expect , since the author is the Italian poet Francesco De Robertis , a man of genius , and he could have created an original story , but unfortunately he wrote a book . It is an interesting fact that the main character in the book , Manduca , is not in this movie , but I understand that it was the Italian film industry that insisted that he should be replaced and that is why a different character played the role in the movie .|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read the review on the back of the cd on Amazon, but I was so impressed with what I had heard, I decided to order one from Play it Again Sam . It arrived within 4 days, and I was really happy with how the cd sounded . I had a CD player which I was using until I got my new player, and I put it on my new player to check how the cd sounded on it. I was totally shocked at how good the CD sounded .|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man , who is sent to prison for a murder which he never did , for the crime which his wife did . He 's put there because her family wants her to pay . And , as time passes , he starts to see things which can not be explained , things which are impossible to explain in a world where we all do everything we can to rationalise and explain away any evidence or information that may contradict our own , accepted view of the world .|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for one for months now and have not had luck finding one. I have been told that if I have a sample of their product I can sue. I 've got a few friends who have sued and lost. So far I 've never gotten my sample of their product and can not prove my case and I know I will never sue them in small claims because of the costs involved. So I 'm left with filing an intent to sue them and have their company send me a sample and wait.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on the run and stay with his Uncle Gus who lives out West. Uncle Gus is not the nicest man. He is a drifter by profession but loves to fish and has his own fishing shack where he and his friends drink and fish. He also likes to cook. He does not have much to do with his nephew but has no choice but to take him when he runs away. In addition, he has another problem, he is not married, he is not rich and he is not even clean.|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had never seen it before and neither had i but we loved every minute of the fun. The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz was electric and they were both really good in their roles. We had so much fun watching it again on DVD. My kids had a great time watching it -- they are in their 20's now and the same age as our daughter was when this came out.We laughed a lot and they were surprised that a Hollywood film could actually be funny.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening night film and was part of a week long festival of Indian cinema. It was directed by Abhijit Deshpande and was a great film. I will try to post more details on it after I get a chance to watch the movie more closely. I just wanted to get this information out to the people who might be planning to see it at the festival. I hope I get time to watch it soon. If you want a review of the movie you can check my other blog post here.|0
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows from that film, but adds a new twist to the story. I had never seen the 1949 movie, because I had never seen the original radio play, or read any of the book. The radio play is a great one - it captures the tension perfectly, and is quite different from the book. The novel is about one of my favourite characters - the boy in the lighthouse . The book is about him growing up.|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
"A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've always liked the 80 's humor , it was fun to make a film on that era . The plot of the film is : After the war , there was a great shortage of drugs , so people have started using them . The problem of this drug is that if you get addicted , you start feeling better than before . One of the best example of this kind of story line is in the film "" A Clockwork Orange ."""|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
"I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I'm no fanboy but this is my review for anyone who has not checked it out yet. It can be found at: www.sho.com

After watching the first three episodes I was very impressed at the direction, editing and the casting of the main cast, even though I knew the majority were going to be American actors. But, they were so good in their roles I couldn't help but get the feeling this was going to be the most realistic TV I had seen in a long, time."|0
Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an old married couple is beyond my knowledge. But the final product is one of the funniest pictures of all time. The story is so bad that it is good and Cage and Cruz can't stop making jokes about it. In the middle of all that, however, the story is also surprisingly moving. Maybe it's because Cage and Cruz have a great rapport and are both great at playing their characters. Maybe it's just the way they make you feel for the characters.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections in 2006, I have discovered something about myself that I wasn’t aware of. In the year that I spent as the ‘local MP’ for Staines, one of my favourite things to do, and to be, is to have a pint with local people. I love chatting to people from all walks of life in the pub and discussing what is on in the local area, and what is important to them.|0
"At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of wannabe police-officers from all over the world converged on Miami for a month-long ""Buddy Cop"" adventure . Now it seems like every weekend there is an update to a popular video game that features a cop in a virtual world . And while video games are a popular and profitable industry, few of their characters have been allowed to live-action life . And it seems as though none are going to make it any time soon . ""Buddy Cop II "" is the latest to join a growing list of video game movies ."|0
"I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved the show, so we taped it a few times and I grew up loving tilt. I recently bought the DVD and its awesome , but my biggest problem with it is that is hard to find anywhere. I have looked online and cant seem to find a place to buy it

This show is on the DVD set that's available for purchase from the official website. You'll need to visit that site if you want to order one."|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that it is a really good film and one that I would like everyone to experience. I highly recommend it. The film is about the true story of a father and daughter who try to flee to Mexico in the early 60s . The daughter is pregnant and is suffering from a serious mental illness . It is a film that I think anyone who is struggling with personal or mental health will appreciate. This is not a film for the faint hearted as it will make you think a lot.|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge mech , the detail is just incredible and even the texture work on all the items is done amazingly . This is definitely one you don't have to miss . I also want to thank my Santa for picking something that i was personally interested in . I'm not a big mech person , but i was glad he got something i would be interested in as well as that he gave me a little bit of insight on it as well . This is really a cool thing .|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for biographers and film historians as well as Holly fans who want to get to grips with the man and his songs. The film explores Holly's life and career up to his tragic death on February 2, 1959 when the crash of the Piper Aerostar on icy Lake Eerie claimed the lives of his wife and three of his close friends and fellow musicians. It is a fact that Holly's songs have never been as popular since his death.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic boundaries. For instance, you have a black millionaire, you have a Jew, you have a woman, you have a Latino and you have an Irishman. In this case, a black man wants to make some money, a Jewish man wants to make money, a black woman wants to marry a Jewish guy, a Latina wants to marry a Mexican guy and the Irish guy wants to marry a Jewish guy. The Irish guy gets in the way.|0
"When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say that I found that the acting was not very good. Not to mention that it seemed that the cast of this series consisted of a bunch of wannabes. I thought that if the acting was this bad, the plots wouldn't be worth watching. Boy was I wrong. I will not even try to describe the plots of these 3 episodes. Let me just say that all of them deal with the ""ticking time bomb situation"" in one way or the other."|0
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot to do with men . And she is a bit awkward when she is with her boyfriend . Jenny Lewis is trying to get a job as a bartender . So , Jenny is doing all the work that she wants . But she is very awkward when she is around the boyfriend . She smokes and does n't have to think about doing her job . And she is very awkward . Jenny Lewis does n't seem to get a lot of attention from men .|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot and the characters don't seem very well defined , as they are very generic . This is one of the few OAV's from the '80's that I would say you have to see to believe . I will admit though , this OAV was a big hit with young children in those days , and it's really not hard to see why . I remember watching it when I was little and I thought it was a pretty good show .|0
"WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... but I was hoping that I would not have to go through this ...

WTF ! ! The Notebook was good ... I was hoping that I would not have to go through this . But I guess that's what happens when one gets attached to a character. But I didn't read the book ... so I don't know how it was really. But I would like to see a book/movie come out of this ! ? WTF ! ! The Notebook was good ..."|0
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) and now I have decided to make a topic where I can discuss the show and everything Attack Of The Show. So if you're interested in the show check out these topics and see if you're interested. Enjoy the show guys. :)

I actually like the show and enjoy it, but the problem is that there's very little to the show, and almost every episode. I would love if there was a little more content in each episode, especially when it comes to the news."|0
"This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for ""Magnolia"") , was shot almost entirely by hand , using no special effects and minimal CGI ( one computerized tracking shot )... it is a film about people, and an honest one at that - for all intents & purposes the only people who care about the characters are the director , actors , and his friends. This is a truly human experience. A film about a family that is forced to spend a weekend together during a tense period in their relationship."|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of growing up , learning to accept change , accepting responsibility for ones actions and then learning to love oneself. There are plenty of people out there who are young and in their twenties , and have the life , the money , the friends , the boyfriends and girlfriends of their dreams , and yet are still unhappy . It's all very sad and I understand that , and I would like to have the life they have , and yet I feel a certain longing for something more.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's a story , its a story that leaves you thinking and talking long after the episode ends . If you are looking for an addictive thrill ride , then you are looking for the right place . The acting , the story and the production value of the show is simply unparalleled . It 's like a great book that will take you on a journey and leave you wanting for a second round . If you 're a fan of TV shows , you would love watching this show .|0
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I cannot stand him . In the first two cartoons , he does have a part , however , I do like Tweety 's personality . He is annoying and is always getting into trouble , even if he 's trying to help , Tweety gets in trouble , so we just have to sit and watch him and his 'friends' get into a pickle . Well , last week , Tweety had his first solo appearance in a cartoon , I really did not care for it much .|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very good cartoon for kids and young adults to enjoy. I am not familiar with the characters and it was easy to follow along with. There was only one problem, I don't know why but it was very difficult for me to read the English subtitles. The story line is very simple. It is about two children who try to stay out all night, get lost and then meet their friend. They then get lost again but are able to find their friend again.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I was so excited about it and I thought it was beautiful and moving . It was great to see this film again and see the characters that I know and love in such detail . I thought it was so well-acted and performed , it made me believe in this film and I can’t wait to see what this film will do on the big screen next year . It was such a well-written story and this film is so well acted .|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and more interesting . It's about a family , three brothers , their father , his girlfriend , and of course the girl's mother . As the story goes on their father becomes sick and is taken to a hospital . While there he passes out and the doctor starts to think he may not pull through . But it is a happy ending in the end ! This was one of the first movies I got from the library. I was intrigued by this movie , since it was a black and white film .|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only had its premiere last night at Tribeca. What makes this film so funny is not so much in its story and script. The Aristorcats film is so funny because of all the characters that we get to see onscreen, even the ones we don’t know about yet. I am speaking of the supporting cast. Even though we get to see them for a short time, they make us want to stay in the theater just to see them on screen again.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a certain physical similarity to Buddy, with big hands and feet. I had never heard of this movie until the other night. When I saw it on tv, it was at a time when I was home with my family and I was sitting with mom and dad and my brother and sisters watching TV. I watched the first few minutes of it and all I saw was Busey. I just thought that Busey would be perfect to play Buddy Holly.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film so when I saw that a new musical version was in the making, I couldn’t wait for it to come out to see my favorite movie brought to life once again. The movie starred Peter O’Toole, Omar Sharif, and Anthony Quayle. Now I’ll be honest, I really wasn’t that impressed with the musical, but I loved the music and the songs. The music was composed by Stephen Warbeck and is sung by a young Robert Wyatt who was then in the Byrds.|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid is going to do something as cool as this ? , the action starts off with the camera flying through a car window , and it looks like a scene from a movie , after that , we see the boy on the bike in the street , and he jumps a bike rack and crashes into a light pole , but it was just as if you were watching a movie , this scene is awesome ! the whole movie is full of the same scene after scene of this , and it's just so cool !|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
"Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter , who would have been born on February 2 1942 , had a short life , cut short at the age of 22 when his plane crashed into a snow covered mountain near Elko Nevada in 1959 . His first solo single was the haunting ""Rave On"". It was a Top 10 hit which was followed by a string of Top 20 hits such as the No 1 ""I Need Your Love"" and ""Have Love Will Travel"" ."|0
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind to date ! '' It's hard to believe that what we're about to witness here is the first of only two releases, but it seems that the makers of this film had more than enough confidence in what they were offering to give it a first and only VHS edition . Although it may seem strange to call a film like this one of the greatest horror movies ever made, we can't deny that if it wasn't for the genre , we would not be watching the film now .|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian film buffs, and I have to admit it is a film that is not only fun but will keep you engrossed throughout the whole duration. The film is directed by Vijay Kumar and co-produced by Jayantilal Gada. It is the story of a young Indian girl, Maya, who goes to America to pursue higher studies. She works as a maid for an upper middle-class American family and lives with them till she finds her own quarters.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architectural father George. Nathaniel is in a constant search for his place in the world. In the course of the film, we watch his relationship with his father. We also get to watch Nathaniel's struggle to become a more authentic and more independent person. Nathaniel Kahn is a contemporary Architect who lives in New York City. As his Architectural practice grows, his relationship with his father George, a renowned architect, gets increasingly complex.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your interest and the film is very intense . I would say you will need a lot of patience to follow it all and to see it in all of it's length , but it is worth the time it takes to see this film. The acting is very good and the plot is well put together. There are a lot of surprises in the film which are very good and exciting . I give the movie a 10/10 and I highly recommend it .|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (which is a good thing if you want a character-driven drama , but bad if all you want is an accurate depiction of events) , and too much talking. I had a hard time getting into the film. The characters all sound the same, and I wasn't buying any of it (at first anyway). But when the actual story started, I really enjoyed it . And the acting was excellent.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided that this was the perfect time to pick up these two old favorites. It was the perfect time, because not only are they re-mastered, but they also come out just in time for Halloween. So what better time to share with you all the latest updates, news, trailers and special editions of The Aristocats, The Fox in the Hound and The Aristocats: Special Edition that will be released for the first time on Blu-Ray and DVD on November 20th, 2015!|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ' ) at a theatre in Washington, D.C., and while I'm not a film-maker or even really interested in movies I found the film to be extremely interesting and moving in it's own way. The story is a fictional account of events in World War II. It centres on the life of a young Polish Jew who is forced into exile and into the Warsaw Ghetto when his entire family is murdered by the Nazis.|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do drama well . And if I had been in that class, I might have liked it more. I enjoyed it . It has its flaws , but I didn't feel cheated . It is a well made film , directed and acted by very talented people . But there are times when I wish I was there to experience it in the movie theater . That is not to say it's not good for TV .|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
"Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially , you may get some ideas to change your life . The movie is called ""Beautiful Girl "" and is the story of a rich man's daughter and her love with a poor girl . I am not going to give away details , but I recommend you watch the movie , and see how the story unfolds . If you are a guy who wants a girlfriend , you may watch this movie as inspiration for your love story , with me ."|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . I watched the originals when they were first airing in syndication in the early 70's , but never again did I see a version of the series in any way , shape or form ( except for an Italian version in the late 60's , and again in the mid- 70's ) . So , the only version I know of are the series from the 60's - 80's . I can't say I've been able to identify the original series in a way that anyone else would find useful .|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
"Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is told by was so traumatized by it he died of a heart attack on the same day as the film was shown for a second time to the public

This was a film that was very shocking to watch, I never thought that things could be so disgusting. But, I had to find out how things got so far and I'm glad that I watched this film because I know a lot better about it. I hope you all enjoy it."|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! Unneccessary violence! A complete waste of time. I can see why some people like this flick , but I have no sympathy for those who love it. This flick is awful. I mean the script and acting is horrible but what really grinds my gears is all of the gratuitous scenes of gun and gore that are shown in it. It's not even worth watching if you think you like this genre. Its so bad it's actually funny.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do hope this comes out as a DVD or something of this nature . It reminds me of a few other films , most of which are not on DVD at the moment , and for which I have an unfulfilled wish for a DVD . This is one of those things that I could watch a hundred times over if I had access to a good quality DVD version . The photography is incredible , the sets are so beautiful , the action is exciting , and the storyline is so good .|0
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona is that of a loser who is just barely getting by . In the movie version of his real-life life story , as in Larry David's sitcom , he keeps getting thrown into situations that are the epitome of a slapstick comedy . And yet, the movie isn't a spoof of his life story -- it's about his life -- and what it's like to go through the life of a person who's always been an outsider .|0
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no different. He starred in a series of propaganda films , which became some of the best films of his entire career. But, while they all had their political themes and messages , one film in particular is remembered by fans for something else. 10 Meet Mr. Smith

While most people know Charlie Chaplin as the Chaplin of the classics , he actually had a lot of success before he made all of those great movies ."|0
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY Rangers ' first NHL Stanley Cup in 1942 , and is located on the site of where the famous Garden stood. It's a big deal to be in this place , so I'm gonna share a little history with y'all to help you decide if you should check it out. The following is taken from 'The History of the New York Rangers' and I've added a little blurb at the end, so if you want to go to the source, that's the place to do it.|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but with great respect. I think the message is clear: if you are thinking of having an abortion, you need to think about the fact that there are other women out there who have also thought about ending their pregnancy but have decided not to. I think that this film does a good job of making these other women a part of the film and they do a very good job of making you think about the decision to abort or carry to term.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it’s a good piece of work. I really like it when a director does not think they’re above making this sort of movie because I’m old enough to appreciate that it was made for the sole reason to entertain us. And that’s how i feel this movie is made. The characters and story aren’t exactly good but they are very well written to make us laugh and to make us feel for these characters.|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , at the time of its release , it was a full-length animated film , clocking in at more than 30 minutes . Today , as it stands, it is about 5 minutes. This is a film that has the power to stir up emotions and make the audience laugh . . . . This is the first of two stories about a boy who finds himself in a series of events that lead him into a world that he never dreamed of.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot and blown to pieces . Good fight scenes . Awesome car stunts . And a good storyline . This movie had it all ! And the special effects were awesome . The only negative thing that i can say about this movie is that it was really slow at first ,but after that it was great . I give this 5 stars . You will be glad that you saw this movie ,it will keep you entertained the whole way through ! So see it .|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with some of the best dialogue in Trek history. As the Enterprise prepares for its maiden voyage , the crew is preparing to make a dangerous and secret mission into Klingon space . The mission will lead them into battle with a group of rogue Klingon renegades known as The Klingons , who are bent on establishing a new and dangerous empire . Captain Kirk and first mate Spock lead the way with the crew, including the Enterprise 's first officer Dr .|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as I think , I 'm a big fan myself . The first one was pretty amazing . This one is ok , but nothing really spectacular . It has some good moments , mainly due to the performances , but it 's nowhere near as good like the original . There are a few funny moments , but no real scares . I think if you 're a die hard chucky fan , this isn 't for you . You 're really going to be disappointed .|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by no means original , but the storyline was very well written . It was simple and to the point . The only issue i had is that i didnt like the twist on the end . I wasnt expecting that . I really liked how the story was told . The only bad thing about it is the poor quality of some of the makeup , but that really doesnt effect me too much because im not too into the whole gore and horror side of things .|0
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very much in my early twenties. It was the summer of 1985 and the only decent movie playing at my local multiplex was Teen Witch. I know that’s not saying much but that was about as much variety as we were getting around where I lived then. So I saw Out Of Contention, which was playing on VHS, at one of my sister’s house a few weeks later and was pleasantly surprised.|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to do a better job of portraying someone who's not a musician but rather a singer/songwriter . The problem with a biography of someone like , however , is that you end up spending much more time in his life as a celebrity in the world of rock and roll than as a person . This is where the biography of begins to fall apart as the author makes a few too many attempts at explaining things to the audience .|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them have their own story to tell , and they are all linked to each other with the same theme. The first is about love , the second is about friendship , the final is about revenge , and they form the heart of the game in a very clever way. The first part , the part about love , is pretty short and takes place a few months after the main events , but the other parts are actually the longest ones , and they also have a good amount of content at their disposal .|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this fable in the beginning. I love fables - the old fashioned type that's easy to read but has a lot of information. And this is just such a good one.I have a couple of niggles. Firstly, why would you leave the country you come from? I know they have all the problems they're facing, but surely the best thing to do is to come over here and fix the problems they've got.|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well and will keep you interested until the end. I think that it is not a game for everyone , but some of the concepts are great and I think that most of the people who try it, will like it . This is a game for hardcore players only and is quite a hard game to play if you dont know how to solve these puzzles. The puzzles were very well thought out and were not that hard. The graphics are also very well done.|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's version. (And that's saying something!) I think it's the most romantic and touching movie I have ever seen, it's a beautiful movie about love and forgiveness. I cried like never before, it's perfect. It's really good that it's a Canadian movie because there's no need to talk about how to do things, the people are very friendly. I think the only reason why Luhrmann didn't got nominated was that it was produced by Harvey Weinstein.|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language can pick up the plot of a story as soon as they start reading. However I do feel like the language can be a little too simple for some English speakers. It does a great job of conveying emotions and making you want to find out how it turns out. The only downside to the book is that it can be quite short so it isn’t the best book for long bus journeys. It’s a good story, well written.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's a series in which Murphy 's character, the slick-talking fast-food king, is trying to regain his position as king of the fast-food restaurants after he has lost it. But the main thing here is the performances by two of the best actors we have in the movie business. Murphy is the kingpin in a fast-food empire run by a former college baseball star (DeNiro ). But he has become so arrogant he no longer gives a second thought to who is running the show.|0
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to look at all the details . There is something for everyone in it , even if you are not into Disney films . The story is fun and interesting . And of course you will want to take a look at it when it is on TV again on the Disney channel . It is also worth watching on the DVD version . You will see a lot more of the film , especially in the last third . So you will love the whole thing , especially if you are a Disney fan .|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from 18 - 50 . Most of them are just regular folks trying to get by in a very difficult financial climate and many of them are from other states. As you can see from the link, the rules are very specific . In the past contestants have had to live together for several months . There is one more element to the show and that is the requirement that when a couple decides to go on the show, that they must first be married for a few months.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about American Civil War and Southern Life, and most famous works of his are “As I Lay Dying“, The Sound and The Fury“, Light in August“, and Absalom, Absalom“. He is also best known for the book Absalom, Absalom!“. In this post, we will learn all about the books by William Faulkner in detail. Faulkner also wrote other novels, which have not won the Nobel Prize.|0

The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a blast . of course , the story is ridiculous in the best sense of the word . but that doesn 't mean you 're not expected to suspend your disbelief for two and a half hours , which i did , anyway . there are only so many jokes you can tell before it gets old . you 'll laugh , but then it gets old , and you begin to notice that the jokes are getting old , too , and it becomes more frustrating than funny .|0
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is lame , the acting is bad , the writing is bad , the direction is terrible , the story is a mess . I give it a 7 because it is an interesting mess . It is not the worst movie I have ever seen . I give it a 7 out of 10 . I hope someone enjoys it . I give it a 7 out of 10 . It 's probably the closest to being great . I give it a 7 out of a 10 .|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described a similar thing in my own life, but the fact that it comes up again and again makes me think about it again and again and again and again. It's funny because I was thinking about this today, but I kept going back to it...and then this morning in my head, I saw the scene and I just laughed. I was reading through a thread that I'm in and saw the line as well.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed towards the young audience. Its about a bunch of high school kids that get together and try to prove to their parents that they are cool. Its a very typical high school movie, with all the stereotypical things that you'd expect to see. Its the typical high school movie, without being too stupid or dumb. So if you are looking for some mindless entertainment, this will do the job. So the movie is basically about a group of high school kids who have a band.|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and all of the people that played their parts in making this movie come to life !!! I 'd be curious to know how this film compares to the book in terms of plot and the way the characters were portrayed in the film ! I think the acting was brilliant and I particularly loved how the main female characters were allowed to take centre stage in the story and were the focus of the story , which I feel is more the case in the book .|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz is doing a nice job with her first leading role. ""Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not snap"" - The First Graders' Creed

""The first step toward victory is to know where you are going."" -Admiral Grace

It is very well put together. I wish more movies were this way. In the case of this one I did not see any reason why they needed to make it as long as they did."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the people and have known many since childhood . I had a friend who used to play in this film and I saw her many times when growing up . All the characters are actors who have lived and worked in the area since the 50's , some since before . It's amazing how many people can tell you , in detail , exactly where the old homes were and when . And they remember the events of the day of the film being made .|0
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Tough times come to Dutchess and her kittens after a burglar steals their belongings and runs off.One of her kittens was able to get loose and ended up being run over by a car and died from the injuries.As the story goes,the cat mom is able to get her kittens some food and some toys.The kittens were able to go outside and play with each other,and were also able to meet a neighbor who let them out to play outside.|0
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde into the present day with a different twist . It's the first in a series and I will definatley see the rest of them . I recommend it to any one who is a fan of the characters and this movie , or any fan at all of the show ! Wow! This movie is one of those rare gems of the genre. It's one of those movies you have to watch in the theater, with the sound turned on and the volume up to max.|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
"Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? No? That's okay. It doesn't matter, because if you did, you've seen all of it's predecessors. And that's because this film has been in production for over twenty years. From the mid-80s to late 90s. When it first started it was called ""The Face of Love"" and the script was written by Ron Howard and Dan O'Bannon. It starred Michael J. Fox, who was still a teen idol after Back to the Future and Family Ties."|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it exists, and can recommend it to anyone wanting to experience it in a movie theater. It is the first movie produced in digital 3-D (yes, I'm sure they call it digital, it looks and moves like it has physical depth). The movie was shot at 3-D and I don't know if the print I have is digital or not. The movie is well worth the price, but I had to see it at the theater.|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best one yet. It’s just as much of a thrill ride as THE TRIBBLES did, but unlike that series, this time around it is not just the usual action-adventure stuff. This one deals with an important subject and one that is important not only to the Middle East and the US-Israel relationship, but to the rest of the world as well, which has been ignored for far too long. I’ll tell you more in a minute.|0
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a city street together and discussing a business idea. But as they go down the street James gets into a car and tries to pull Luca into the backseat . When Luca refuses he drives off . This is a scene that was shot years before the movie was released . Jeff Garlin , who plays James, talks about the scene . “ There is a scene where I ask Luca if he'll be my partner. He tells me it's none of my business and walks away.|0
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Timberlake will be trying to outdo him, not that the last one did so very well. The song he chose is “Cry Me a River” by singer/producer Céline Dion, which was the biggest hit of 1998, peaking at number two. And it is a good choice, as it is indeed a good song. It is from the album The Colour of My Love, which Dion did for the soundtrack to The Parent Trap II.|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a beautiful and defenseless lady, because she refused to have sex with him; this happened in Via Veneto , a street of the world famous Italian capital. He killed the girl brutally and dismembered her body in a very atrocious manner, like what happens in some barbaric countries of Asia or Africa, in order to make sure to not leave any clues. The police did their job, they made the arrest, but now, what do we do?|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how he came about to be a leading figure of modern architecture and urbanism. With a history of working in New York and London , as well as other countries , including Canada , India , and Turkey , he has become one of the leading figures in the world of modern architecture and urbanism. It’s very interesting to see that even as a young person he saw that buildings should be of great quality , they should be attractive to look at and to feel good and comfortable to live in .|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was thrilled when I got a call from her . My husband had taken the dogs out for the day, so we decided to take our little one out . After we dropped him off with my mom , who was taking him to his grandparents , we got a message from her that she needed to stay inside and watch him for about 15 minutes , so we agreed . When we picked him up from my mom 's house we noticed he had a strange color to him .|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
"LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch a video on YouTube and saw this. Thought I'd better share it. It's quite hilarious , especially the way the guy pretends that this was just a normal scene. The fact is that the guy did this a lot, and this is a common scene in Bollywood . The video is titled "" How To Steal A Film From a Movie "" and it is quite an old video , made around 2005 I think . It's also on YouTube ."|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
"The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. Holly is singing and playing his guitar on a stage lit by the moon and a spotlight. As he sings, the camera moves into a shot that reveals the entire roller rink. Other bands play as the girls dance to Buddy Holly and the Crickets, their hair flying in the breeze. We hear Holly's voice again, and he begins singing the title song from his first hit: ""That'll be the day."" He plays a chord as the song fades out."|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who goes to a Romanian man for help . The Romanian man then goes to Istanbul and then to Israel . He has been told that if he gives the man $ 50 ,000 he can go back to his family in Romania and everything will be OK . Billy Crystal ends up having a bad day at work ( he has to work on his day off ) , and when he arrives at the house , he discovers the man is dead . He is distraught and goes back to his hotel .|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . The lead actors gave their best . The background score was very touching . The action sequences in the last part were very intense . The editing of the movie was very good . The acting and music was good . The director also did a good job . Overall the film was worth watching . A very good film for those who have time . If you're a movie buff and a fan of romance or love stories, then this is the movie you're looking forward to .|0
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was winding down and they were ready for something more than a hit single, they wanted an album. And that's where 'Head' comes from. You've got the lyrics of 'Head'. But it's actually the first Monkees album to be done with a full band behind it. The other three albums had a string section, brass, keyboards, a bass player. This album had a brass section. 'You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling' by the Beach Boys was released in 1965.|0
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy. I am happy to hear her new show is a success . She was one of the first celebrity chefs I watched , and I do enjoy following her . It was good to hear she had a nice holiday and is back on her feet . She makes it look so easy . I like watching her too. She has a fun show and I'm happy to hear she's been enjoying her new show! I wish her the best in the future.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched the world over to see it again. It is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. I'm very glad that it came out on VHS a few months back. I hope that the DVD release comes out soon. It's too bad that it took so long to put out a movie that deserves a release. I love it. It was a great experience seeing it again. I hope that the next time I see a movie it's on DVD.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there at the cinema today. And that's the thing that excites us the most. We have no idea of what the response will be in the marketplace."" The studio also has the rights to the film in the U.K. where it should open this fall. But it won't be in the U.S. until January 2012. It'll be a long time until it arrives on video or home video (the movie was in production until December)."|0
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because he is the first real pop star I have met since I was a baby . I saw the Beatles in London in 1964 , but I never had the opportunity to get to know Mike before or even after the release of his first album , 'Head ' in 1968 . As I said , he is not only a good person , he is the most interesting , most genuine artist that I can remember meeting . He has the most original ideas about what makes a pop singer , an artist and a pop song .|0
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang , was quite entertaining , but this one is just amazing ! The acting and the cinematography is top notch ! But , I think the best thing about this film is the soundtrack , it is superb !!! A MUST have , for all Mr.Im fans ! Enjoyed it a whole lot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , I think this is not the only issue in the game. After playing through the game twice, I found that it’s also possible to die and lose every level in a single go, and it makes the game very un-challenging. I found this out the hard way . So , here is my take ( in my opinion ) as to what the game was trying to say , in the beginning. The first half of the game takes you through the story of the game.|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply brilliant role. They share a love story that has all the intensity of the very first love of their lives. They have a connection that is so true that you are mesmerised by their relationship as they share their most intimate moments. Diane Lane portrays an independent and strong woman who chooses her own destiny. She wants her independence and is not going to allow anyone to stand in her way when she is going to find herself a rich and powerful husband.|0
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to that laughter. Watch this with friends who will love it too. This movie is a comedy, but it is also quite sad. It tells a story that's not only funny, but also heartwarming and sad. You will have no choice but to cry at this movie. Watch this movie with some friends and see if you will be able to take it. It's hilarious! It's the best! I loved this movie.|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote cottage in the Lake District to find out why she is thinking about ending her marriage to Mark, who she has just found to be unfaithful. Sue, the eldest of Kate's three sisters has not seen her for almost two months. In her absence Kate, a freelance journalist has been working on a piece for Marie Claire magazine. She meets Sue on her arrival at the remote cottage where Mark lives with his new girlfriend.|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I love this . I think I can see a bit of that . It looks to me to be very different than a normal vampire . And in it's own way , this is even better . More realistic . I love the way you draw the vampires and the werewolves . It's like a comic book . It looks like the story is coming to an end now . What happens next ? Wow, you've got good taste. This is one of my top favorite TV series.|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have killed the father of the other ( played by John Gielgud ) , and the other tries to help the police with clues , which they don’t have. So far , it’s not that interesting , but it gets better after about a minute or 2 . It’s quite funny , in the sense that there is some good humour to be found in the police department , which has just lost its best and most senior detective , so they’re not exactly in an enviable state .|0
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . So, it is always good to see how these directors approach the art of screenwriting . This is the first of a 2-part interview in which we follow the life and works of a man whom I had the great pleasure to meet last year on the occasion of his book launch in Berlin . The man in question is ''Pietro Scaroni'' (1944-2012) , Italian-born director , writer and composer who has a huge body of work under his belt.|0
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is cleverly played, I think this post is for you. The film, a French comedy that is very funny, is ""Les Valseurs"", and I am very proud of the translation that I found for it. In other news, in the last few weeks I have seen ""The Good German"" three times! I am sure it is not just me, I think it is a great film, and that I will go see it a fourth time!"|0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling production values. I was so happy to be so completely wrong. This movie is stunning, the visuals are gorgeous, the story, characters and acting are great and it is just a damn good film all round, I can't think of a negative comment. I highly recommend you give this a watch and if you are anything like me, you will end up wanting to go out and watch this movie again, and again, and AGAIN!|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific imagery but he was also able to take a more character-centric view. It’s rare I find myself laughing as I watch films, and this was the case for me with Fulci’s The Beyond . There were many moments of black humour and even more moments of sheer terror. While I was initially concerned that this was a “cult film” for “cultists” I found myself surprised by the number of non-horror and non-cult film fans who I’ve seen recommend the film to others.|0
"I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect . well , 
i'm glad that i came across it , since it was one of the better horror films i've seen in a long , long , loo-oong time ! this was an entertaining horror-thriller . you see , in a small town in northern california , an evil serial murderer , named lonny ( kevin spacey ) , has been killing the women that he sleeps with . the women don't have much time to live , since there are about a month left in each woman's life ."|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to see a movie of this same theme again but in the US. Was it as bad as they said? I've seen this movie many, many times over the past 30 years, and it's always been one of my favorites. The story was great, it had a great soundtrack, the dialog and acting was top notch. I've always loved this film and it never fails me. I've watched it at least three times a year for the past three decades.|0
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience is affecting him negatively. He says Desmond is in a bad state and that it is his time. They try to get him up, but it is not working. He has gone through a traumatic experience and that has caused him to go through a breakdown. He needs help. Sawyer tries to wake him by hitting him. He is not awake. They take Desmond to a hospital and try to find out what is going on, but the doctors can't tell them much.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but what exactly are we going to be seeing ? We can only hope that the answer to that question is not something quite like what we've seen so far . The first trailer dropped in August , and was an intriguing one , offering little in the way of story or character development . Instead , the trailer contained a few short moments of what was going on , along with a few hints at what the supernatural element is all about .|0
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him from behind and kills him on the spot. Or a woman walking home from her night job is assaulted in a deserted street, her attacker rapes her and slashes her face with a razor. Or a teenage girl is forced into the back seat of a car as her father drives away from work, and when she's released she is driven off to an isolated area where she is gang-raped in a field, beaten and stabbed.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind! I didn't get it at the time - it was just cool sci-fi stuff from another planet. I loved it, but I thought it was kind of cool, but there was so much more to this show that I couldn't seem to grasp in high school and college. I was just a bit too stupid to get it. Then about 2-4 years after it ended I was walking around my local comic store when I saw the box set for it!|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't bad and the voices are very charming , particularly that of Bebe Moore Campbell as Miss Bianca . I did have a couple of problems with this film though . There is one scene with the Aristocats that I thought was a little 'off' . It just seemed out of place and didn't fit in. I also didn't like the ending - it felt too much like a happy ending . I do however love all the songs and I would say that the film is fun .|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every single scene of it being so . And yes , a little heartwarming . This picture is the reason why I love the Twilight series more than I should . I mean , come on , this is the best moment of Twilight : New Moon! I love it! I don't know why, but it really moved me so much . But yeah , it was just perfect ! I love that part when Bella is talking to Jacob about how she can see in his blood .|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the early 1900's. I saw it in the theater. It was not a good experience. The only good part about this film is that it deals with racism in a way that it wasn't done before. The message that is given in this film is very powerful. The ending is very well done and it shows that no matter what religion or skin color a person comes from he or she will have to go through the same struggles and hate.|0
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it came out . I can watch it all over again over and over and will never tire of it . This is one of the best of all time sci-fi thrillers and I have enjoyed every viewing of it since I taped it . John Carpenter has always been the most talented director in cinema since his first major hit in 1976 . I am so very happy to see another great film from him , which is a tribute to his genius and his amazing talent for making such great films .|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i liked how the story kept changing , it was very original , and well worth the wait for the new season . I hope they don't mess up the new season , and make it the same as season one

I loved this season of Dexter , I was a bit worried about it being more of the same , but it was so different . The acting , the characters , the story . I could go on and on about this ! Dexter is awesome !"|0
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave the show a very good review . He wrote, ‘I love it! It’s very funny.’ You know what the show is like . But he said he loved it, which I found very funny because we’ve never had anything but negative things said about our show . He was a good man and he loved it. And he called me a couple times a couple months after he’d left EW and he said, ‘I had a great time .|0
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1

It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which artists and intellectuals are mired. the genius does not necessarily come with success and in order to make a living, he has to resort to any kind of profession or trade, just as chihaweseon is doing. I do not think that this film was meant to depict the dilemma faced by the intellectual. it was meant to be an ode to the creative genius. what do u think? i do agree that chihaweseon could have chosen other professions like being a doctor , teacher or a police man.|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a very well edited movie with great action , and excellent fighting . This action movie has a great storyline , and is very entertaining . Great character development . The movie is extremely violent , yet it is well edited to show you only what the character's need to know . This movie has the blood and guts , so if you like that kind of stuff , than this one's for you . It has the right mix of blood , action ,and great acting .|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since there is not much in the way of plot , character , or even comedy to distract you from the beauty. This movie is really a visual experience . What do you want to see more of in a movie , or in general ? The story should be good , and there should be plenty of characters for you to root for. This is not the case here . There's no good characters to root for , there is no story , and there is no humor .|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with this movie. It is true that it does not have any of the action or suspense of some of the bigger films, but it does have some really cool ideas and a really cool concept. The movie opens with a great concept - we follow the actions of a young man living in a high-rise apartment building. Every day, he has to travel through the streets of an abandoned city to get to school and back.|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but that happens when sequels come out so it was still a fun movie. It is not as good as the first one but it was still entertaining. I thought this was a pretty well done movie. I didn't think I'd love it but I sure did! I think there was some pretty good acting by the whole cast. This is the kind of movie I would watch when I wanted to have some fun.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Field ) who was raped at knifepoint. She then develops anorexia nervosa and decides to go on a hunger strike. It's a real eye-opener to see the life of a person struggling with an eating disorder. There are no easy solutions to this problem. Everyone is affected in their own ways, but the film certainly makes it more real. This was a fun film to watch . I think it is important that people recognize the issues of eating disorders and try to help others that are struggling.|0
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both are the same in one sense . The show is a big budget production which will be watched worldwide . The show is about a bunch of rich kids who end up in a fantasy world when they were playing with magic stones . One of the kids is an orphan . At first , he didn't believe that he was actually there . He wanted to escape and came across a girl who told him that this was an alternate reality .|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not worth your time. Giallo films were made during a peculiar time in the 80's and 90's when the Horror and Thriller genres were reaching new heights in the States, and the Giallo films of that era were some of my favorite films. If you're a new reader or fan of Giallo's, this review may not be much to you, but it is my personal favorite Giallo, so it is a must read if you love Giallo's and have yet to watch this classic!|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself , I can tell that they have no idea on what the Egyptians look like or talk like . The movie itself has some good scenes and bad scenes that make it entertaining . My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes in Egypt , though if it were me , they could have been a bit more creative . I love how the characters are portrayed in the movie and also how the different parts of the characters are portrayed . The acting was great and the sound quality was amazing .|0
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved in practice and is not the best approach, except perhaps in the very smallest of databases where the number of rows is very small, as is usually the case. One approach that can be used that is often effective, especially if the database is small, is to set up two or more separate databases, often called `` master `` and `` slave .`` The master can be set up and maintained with as many rows as you wish.|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various periods of my life. There is a part that I really like when you see a family having a really bad day and you feel bad for them and you see them cry . There are moments when you actually feel what these people are going through and the good thing is that you know how they got to this point . I'm sure that this was a movie to make them cry . I just love it because it does make you feel so much .|0
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following , and the trailer looked promising enough . It does have it's charms . And if you've read this review , then you know that I do not like to write bad reviews on movies . In fact , this was the first time I had ever given a movie a bad review . It's not that it was bad , but it was just not what I expected . I didn't see it's potential . There are some things in this film that make me want to re-watch it .|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to design his own apartment in New York City. For the first time on screen, Kahn has been given complete control over his architectural space, free from the constraints of architecture's traditional client-based practice. As a child, Kahn had dreams of being an architect, but that never really happened. At 21 years of age he was working as a software engineer, but his interest in the discipline grew. After a decade at his job, he decided it was time to pursue a career as an architect.|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this movie . the acting is good all round but particularly , for my money , , by the man who is perhaps most likely to make a career of westerns in the new millennium i , m . chris ' clint e . eastwood ' s performance is simply superb and , at the risk of overplaying it , i must say that i believe it is one of the best , best of all the great , great westerns that america has ever produced .|0
"My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers . but the movie doesn't make the movie-makers feel bad about that , because the movie-makers , instead , feel bad about a different question : "" what the hell were those people doing in the desert anyway ? "" this is the problem of this film . there are no answers , just endless questions , which , as we have come to expect by now from hollywood movies , are the same damn questions over and over and over again ."|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . i loved it . the story , based on true events , revolves around , as the title suggests , how a group of inmates escape a maximum security federal penitentiary . in their attempt , a group of highly skilled burglars ( played by , among others , matthew modine and ed ward albertson ) kidnap the chief warden's ( kevin pollack ) wife , and threaten to murder her if he doesnt give them free rein .|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys from Season 1 are gone so what else did you see last season ? You probably know what's going to happen. You already know what happened to them . And you're probably thinking about why you're here . I'm not here to tell you the whole story , but I will try my best . This is a journey through the past . I hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it .|0
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of that? I mean, I can't say that I was expecting much, but I really didn't have any expectations for it at all. I really enjoyed it for what it was. I thought it was pretty funny , especially for being so short and cheesy. It was a lot of fun seeing all these actors that we know and love back together, and we get some good cameos out of people that we didn't know before.|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient , '' is hitting the theatres, which also happen to be the 50 th anniversay of India s 1 956 Partition of Pakistan. This was a watershed for the subcontinent, and the film makes a strong argument about how a single event can shape a nation s future. The first half hour or so is about the making of the film itself, but after that, the drama takes the viewer on a tour of three villages in India s north-west.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make me squirm in my seat , but overall this was a very well made film . The acting , writing , and directing all worked well together to form a nice movie that you could enjoy . I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a movie to watch or just looking for a fun film to enjoy . This was a very good film . I would say it was a very entertaining movie that had a good storyline and great actors and actresses playing their roles.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful place . The world was so far gone it had fallen into despair . Then came the light. And it was time for me to join. With my friends. It had started a year ago. It was the time of the year when many died in the desert. Many who had survived the desert before. In my village there was still hope. Everyone was getting ready, and we knew something was going to happen. I waited for it for a month.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to one shot of their car driving off into the sunset as they're being chased by a police car, all you hear for about 20 seconds is ""Oh man, I don't wanna get in trouble, but oh man, I'd love to go to California"" (and of course they do). I just watched the film for the very first time. I was never a Monkees fan."|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who was a rock star before Idol and now he is back , the guy from Idol 2 who was one of the worst contestants , a girl who is a soap star but has been out of the soap world for a long time , an older guy from Broadway that is a singing coach , a guy who was the musical director of the musical Oklahoma and is now working as a singing director and a guy who is on the panel that judges the contestants .|0
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the story's narrator and hero into an over the top, and sometimes even silly, performance as well. And that's not an easy thing to do. But the movie's got a great cast , and Cage is surrounded by a colorful bunch of colorful people . That alone makes it worth seeing. But it 's a real shame that the movie is so muddled that even its actors don't know what happened in it .|0
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which is in part biographic and partly analytical , , the life and times of one of the world's most talented architects is presented . The film tells us of his life in his native Lithuania and how this influenced his work as an architect .The documentary presents his early training , the buildings he designed , his ideas and his influence on architecture to this day . The film tells us a great deal about the man , his work and the influence he had on the 20th century .|0
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing my reaction ... I sat and watched and was not bored ... I was captivated ... In fact , I don't know of any other show where you sit and watch two people who you love with so much intensity .... I loved them both ... I was in love before the show was even over ... They both deserve huge congratulations for being amazing on screen .... I am now convinced that this was an amazing couple .... I loved their on and off relationship .... And, of course, how they got together ....|0
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary was a boy. After watching it, i have to say i really like this movie. I am a guy, so i know nothing about the movie and i dont know anything about this director. The only thing i can tell is that this is probably one of the best movie i ever seen, not just for it's quality but it is a movie that you can just relax in and enjoy the movie without thinking you are wasting your time.|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was skeptical when I heard about this and when I saw that it was the director of the Matrix, I thought it would be a flop movie . I was wrong , this movie is so cool and its just like an old time action movie . I would recomend this to fans of the Matrix and all time action movies . It was like watching a live action video game, I was glued to the action and couldn't sleep the next day .|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in some strange and surprising way , and I enjoyed it for one very specific reason. There are plenty of things to hate about this episode , it's got a terrible title , it's a mess in terms of production value , it's poorly animated in several places . But there's one thing you can't argue with : it makes fun of itself , and it makes fun of itself really well . I'd recommend watching it even if you've seen the original movie .|0
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them. He's quite excited about going on a trip to one of their parks, but we don't want to get taken for a ride. There are lots of scams going on there and it seems that people have got scammed out of lots of money. I've always just said 'don't worry, I'm here to help' if we get taken, and we haven't been. Is there a way of telling if we're going to be scammed?|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain , mud , cold , and trenches are all in this picture . Chaplin doesn’t have a great role . He does well . In fact , he does a very good acting job . I’ve always admired Chaplin’s talent . He was a silent film genius and I admire him in that sense . He had tremendous style . However , it’s the fact that Chaplin doesn’t try to be realistic . He does a good acting job and he is very funny .|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is more than just funny and very clever at times. However it is also the way that he talks and speaks. You see, when you speak to him, you have a sense of what's going on and the way he speaks in such a fast flow of slang and street talk makes you laugh . It also makes you think. I think that Ali G deserves an Oscar. He is clever, funny, intelligent, charismatic and he could be a Hollywood film star.|0
"I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be an entertaining and well put together movie . There is a lot of suspense in it , and a lot of drama in it too . But overall , the movie is really entertaining , with good performances in the movie . Here are 5 things I loved about this film

1- It’s really well made . The film is very well put together , from the direction , writing , story , and music . It’s all good , and it makes the whole movie a success ."|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i love watching him on stage when he is doing all those parts that he is amazing in !!! He is amazing in ! ! I love his voice in ! ! i love his look and his style, his sense of timing, I think he is amazing !!! i love his hair !!! i love how he treats all the cast and crew and his love for all his fans. I really enjoyed that performance.|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a new generation of TV crime series that seems to be more than just re-hashing old cop shows or doing a spoof of old ones. There is a freshness to shows like The Shield and Nip Tuck that just doesn't seem to exist in, say, NCIS . What makes a new cop show? Is it a new concept? Is it the way it is presented? One of the most exciting things about new TV crime series seems to be the fresh look at the crime genre.|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell his side of the story about how he became one of the men who was captured and imprisoned for war crimes. He doesn't remember much of anything that happened, but he does recall that his best friend (played by Tom Hardy) died in the prison and that he killed his best friend, then killed another soldier who tried to rape him. I love this story because it gives us some insight as to how someone with no real memories would behave.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and an eye for striking visuals. There's quite a lot of nudity and gore throughout the film but it never feels exploitive. The film manages to pull off a lot of clever things without ever becoming too heavy-handed. It also has one of the creepiest final moments ever. If you like Fulci you'll love this one. ""I think of him as the Marlon Brando of zombie movies. He's long past his expiration date, but so is the genre."|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the film very disturbing , not only because of the content of the plot but also the way it was shot and edited. I remember seeing this when it was released on TV and being really frightened to watch it again. I saw it again a long time later & found it so disturbing that i had to fast forward past the end of it ! I found that the film made me very angry , even though it is a fairly tame film , it is the way it has been edited in .|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) of all time . director giovanni colotti and writer carlo napolitano give you , along with a talented ensemble cast , a dark , witty , and fast-moving work of art that is a real must see . you'll see it in english with subtitles , and , if you have a sense of humour , it'll be great , if not , you can always watch the original , dubbed in english and with subtitles as a second option . you will like it .|0
"OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . the film is directed by alexander pegg , and is the second in a trilogy he has made . it is more similar to the first one in the sense that it is more about relationships and the problems they cause . the first film was brilliant . i remember watching it at the cinema and going "" what the hell . "" then i saw it again and thought "" that's a really good movie , the way it's filmed , the way it's written . """|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently has a perfect poker face, and he plays the game very convincingly . The first time I saw the show was at my aunt's place in New Orleans. I remember that my aunt's neighbor was a fan of the TV show, and this neighbor had brought a VCR tape of the program. I remember watching the episode in a room where the lights were off, with my aunt lying in bed and the neighbor sitting on the other side of the room.|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! - but he is still evil - but he still kills ( a little ) - and I still love him . Chucky is the only thing that I like in this entire film . Well I love him anyway . I see all this as a whole . I can see the good and the evil . The horror and the funny . I can understand where all the people are coming from . I can understand all their emotions . It can be pretty hard to understand all that when it is all around you .|0
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives, are rare. They are even more rare when the documentary is made by the child himself or herself. The following documentary by an eleven-year-old boy about the life of his father will be a unique experience for everyone who sees it. The story is simple and yet the emotions involved are very moving. The young narrator is an excellent writer, and he has used this film as a school essay for the past two years in his school for children with learning difficulties and children with Autism spectrum disorders.|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom in it, but it is not easy to be a wise man, so most people have missed it . There is a reason for this, but we will get into that in just a moment. This musical has a very powerful story line. A young man, David, who is from one of the highest of the upper class, finds out one night that he has lost his memory . He finds that the girl of his dreams is now involved with a man who is not as smart as him .|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime. Some are pretty good, but they don't compare to true-crime books or TV shows that have been out for years, like The Jinx. Not that all crime books are equal or that all true-crime movies are good. But a true-crime book is a whole lot better than what you'll find on a TV channel. A lot of people have read The Jinx and have never seen or heard of it. So how did it happen?|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in their life experiences, and not just a typical young-adult romance, and I also liked the idea of showing the story from each of their perspectives, rather than one character’s point-of-view for the whole book. And, the story is very much about how we deal with situations in our lives, so I think it is appropriate for YA and middle grade. The main characters are very likable. They both have flaws and are imperfect, but they both have strengths, and I like that.|0
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this movie on the movie website IMDb . But it never really dawned on me that IMDb and other film review websites are generally not read by film buffs or general movie goers. The general movie goer is more likely to look into the “movie” reviews on a website like Amazon or Blockbuster because they want to see what a reviewer thinks of a movie before spending money on it. And most of the time when you read reviews , you find people ranting about a movie that they hated.|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that this movie can be watched by everyone and everyone who watched this movie would surely like to recommend the movie to his friends. I have watched this movie twice because of the way it made me see things and also to see what others would think of it . The most interesting thing about this movie is that no matter who you watch it , no matter how old you are , no matter how stupid you think , this movie will hit you right in your heart and you would just love it no matter what .|0
"i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , i just hope the book is better . 0

This is a book that you have to read to see what I was talking about. It’s about a beautiful family and the trials and travails of the parents. The movie was soooo bad that you have to see the book to understand the story. I loved the movie, but was disappointed to see so many changes from the book."|0
"I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been in this industry, he has had a hand in one or two projects in development for me - the only time that I've had my own movie greenlit was when it was under the aegis of his company "" EuropaCorp "". For years, he has been one of the most consistent creative forces within the genre, and I believe he is still one of the most creative directors to have ever worked within this genre. He knows exactly what to do and what to leave alone."|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. India’s rich cultural past comes alive on screen as he explores its many dimensions. He is a connoisseur of the Indian arts of poetry and music, which is evident in all his movies. Bharatbala has won several National Awards and international accolades for his works and has also been nominated for Best Director at Academy Awards. We are extremely proud to announce the return of the great Rajiv Menon to the team. Rajiv Menon is an established Indian film critic and author.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) ,but for the director too , who had made his mark with such cult horror movies as The Terror ,House on Haunted Hill, The Raven ,and the original version of Night of the Living Dead ,but who was now being touted by the Hollywood elite as one of the greats and the man who would bring science fiction back to mainstream films. ( And he’s probably not that bad an actor ! ) This film was originally released in America on June 19 ,1968 ,as Star-Spangled Psychotic.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch it every day. If you know my history, you’d understand why. If you’re interested to know, here is an article I wrote about the A-team on RTL7 last month. And here is an article that talks about the popularity of the A-team in the Netherlands. It includes a video, of which I’m the voice. Anyway, before I get into this post, I’ll tell you what’s on my mind for today.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was my favorite drama of last years and I was looking for it again last year. After watching it again , I really wish it gets picked up now . Borderline was one of the few shows that was great from start to finish . The characters were interesting and well developed . It also had the most intriguing storyline . The first season was so much better than the second and that is really saying something . The second season was good but the third season was the best one .|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. It's like watching a movie that you just can't stop watching. If you get to the point where you have to stop watching it because you have to start something else then you better stop watching anything. I recommend this movie to anyone . Diora Baird was born on June 27, 1988 in the UK. She began acting on TV at the age of five. She has had bit parts in several TV shows, including Doctor Who and Merlin.|0
"Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , the movie industry 's worst film was just as bad as the worst film : It was "" The Ten Commandments . "" The only good thing to come out of the production of the film was its director, Cecil B. DeMille . But the script , the production design , the photography , and even the performances , especially from Charlton Heston , were so badly handled that most people remember it mainly for the way the film was cut ."|0
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been boring ! ) I love it all. It's like a big family gathering to celebrate all the food we've enjoyed throughout the year !!! You have to feel good about how it's all turned out when you watch this ! This was the best episode. It was fun and entertaining. I wish there were more cooking shows. I don't watch a lot of cooking shows because there's usually nothing new or creative on the shows.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the first. It has to be at least funny, so you’re sure that everyone will watch, so we can all laugh at how stupid everyone was. So I’m going to make a list of some of my favorite comedies that happen during military times, with some explanations as to why I chose them. If you notice any omissions, or want to add a comedy to this list, feel free.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson, because that's the only part he has. But I gave the show a nine because it had such potential. The script was really good. But I give it mostly a nine because I love the characters in it and it's hard to get through. This is the only one I've seen where you don't like the characters because of how they act so it was a lot harder on me than it is on other people I've seen in this category.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now we get a reboot . Well, I didn't find it too great, but I guess I'll give it a try to see if the reboot will live up to expectations. The first one I saw was the first trailer, and I didn't find it as good as I did the original. I think the second one, which I didn't see, made up for it though. So I'm sure Chucky 3 can't suck too badly.|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine character work , this would not be a movie that i would care to see . He is so natural , so genuine and so right for this part , that it is impossible to imagine anyone but him filling this role . If only he hadn't been so good , i would have hated this film . But it isn't the acting that i dislike here . No , it is the material itself which , as i've said , is just bad .|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm glad to say that it 's not the disaster you might be expecting from the first few moments. It took me a while to realize why I liked this movie so much , but once I did , it was impossible to take my eyes off it . After all , this is one of the most powerful vampire films I 've ever seen . You might be thinking that I 've seen a lot of these films , but this is truly a first for me .|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a little on the light side . Worth a look , especially if you like your entertainment light . What's the story ? The plot is quite simple . Three young women travel in a car when the car is pulled over for speeding . While the woman in the backseat is doing something on her computer one of the girls starts to feel sick . The driver of the car gets the car into an emergency lane , when they are stopped and the car is turned off .|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Cardellini and Bill Pullman . The British film's title is the name of an old newspaper headline that Tom Wilkinson's character uses as a basis for a speech he makes to an audience of antiwar activists who are on their way out of a meeting. He begins:

I don ' t think I can take much more than this. It doesn't feel right any more, this war. It ' s just a way to kill people."|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their place , but by the mid-80s he was becoming a more and more unapologetic gore-monger . I 'm still not a massive fan . I found The Beyond , a relatively tame entry to his gore-filled films, to be a decent horror-comedy , but I have to say that his last couple of films The Beyond and City of the Living Dead were complete and utter rip-offs ( and I 'm being kind in describing the latter as a rip-off).|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . The main character in this story, Valeria, is one of my favorite characters created in the whole series of Stalker. Valeria, a very beautiful and innocent girl. She has an incredible talent to attract everyone around her, especially with men. She loves to read and listen to music, so she always finds herself in her bedroom. Her room is completely filled with books, candles, and music. She has everything she needs there. She is very caring and sympathetic.|0
"This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . there is much more emphasis on the story , but the action is still great . there are lots of fight scenes , especially a great final battle which i would rate 10 times higher than the original . it has a good storyline which is very original , and is very well written . the acting is good and the movie has very good cinematography . the graphics are also very good , and the animation is better than 
the original , which makes this film alot better than the original ."|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that's so simple yet so compelling that it'll have you hanging on for every moment it plays. I'm sure it's been done before, but it still works because the script, the performances, and the filmmaking is so strong. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go to your local video store or your favorite streaming video service and rent/own this movie. It's just that good. Two Soldiers starts out with a really cool premise.|0
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store, but I loved it. And I've never read the book and don't really need to. I've heard so much of it though...I think that's part of why I'm so obsessed with the movie. It sounds like a great read, though. I loved this film, but it's probably not a book I'd get into in the same way I got into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! It's a fun, funny, and charming movie. I highly recommend it... especially for the kids. It would be an excellent choice for the theater if your family would enjoy it, but if not, you can always rent it to have for yourself. I was happy to see it available for free in the library system in the past week or so. Enjoy the sneak peeks:

If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I watched it like 5 times the day I got it! I LOVE IT ! I just love the story , the music ( especially the end), the acting , the cinematography and everything! I loved it! It was really exciting and fun! I loved it all ! ( I have a little spoiler in there.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies to have a fun time with a couple of people, to laugh and to enjoy, that is what i look for when going to the movies. I sat down and was very confused, my friend and i didn't know anything about this movie . I went to this movie for the laughs and that was all that I was expecting , but I was very wrong. The laughs were few and far between, which was very annoying. I went in knowing absolutely nothing about the movie.|0
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for one of the most important advertising accounts in the business . In fact, the agency is so confident they’ve won the business that they’ve decided to celebrate by making an ad that shows a dog playing catch with a Frisbee with the tag-line: The best way to find love is through dogs. We soon see that it’s time for the board meeting to begin. As they walk into the meeting, it’s Putney who makes the first move.|0
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you are a big fan of action adventure films, you will no t need to see any other films after you watch this one . If you ha ve n't seen the movie yet , please go see it. This movie will be out in the theatres on August 3, 2006 . This movie was okay . There were only one or two decent scenes . The movie was too boring , too slow , the plot was bad , the characters were not likeable .|0
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who has been watching and waiting for just such an occurrence is not amused by the situation and he has no intention of being mauled by the cats of Madame Tussaud. In order to protect the Butler he has to hide out and plan a way to get rid of the cats, even though it seems to be the most difficult problem of his life! But just when he thinks that his troubles are over, the cats go on a rampage and he finds himself stuck in an unfamiliar room with a beautiful woman!|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a woman being killed in a bizarre fashion that is only half understood. It soon becomes clear why the killers were after her though - after all the clues are uncovered, it is a case of life and death between the man who murdered her and the woman he loves. It's a little tricky to know whether to be more upset by the crime itself, or that the murder was actually a murder in the first place!|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage show . The story takes place in the 1950's and focuses on the troubled , troubled childhood of a boy named Tony. It is the perfect film if you're in need of a real-life, emotional movie . The film shows how children are treated and it shows us a glimpse into what their parents must have gone through. It's very well written, directed and acted and it shows us what a child of that time period was up to.|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his best in his first dramatic role in a long while . It's no surprise that it's a part that has called for him to stretch himself , and he is more than equal to the task . I don't know what to think of his character though . I think he played it too close to the heart . He never really got under the skin of this character , and at times it seemed a bit too saccharine for me .|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss , longing , and infidelity , in a hauntingly personal tale set in the 1950s in the United States . Woloszczuk’s debut feature “Love Me If You Dare” stars Tim Roth and Joanna Lumley . The film centers on a young soldier ( Roth ) who returns to his native United States to visit his terminally ill mother. Lumley plays the young widow to whom he returns, and in one of their scenes, they are in bed and she tells him about her husband who died .|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps our attention during the movie. An enjoyable movie for everyone that likes movies of Greek origin. I recommend it for those who love meditteranean locations and landscapes, for those who like movies that keep our attention for a very short time. I recommend it for everyone, specially for those who like movies that keep our attention during all the movie. A very interesting movie that keeps our attention during the whole movie and that is very interesting for the audience.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited, because the trailer looked amazing! They had a great cast and looked like they had it all figured out. But then there was the film's release, and it seemed like the film had more or less ... not died. It was released and it did poorly at the box office. So, the question is ... did this film deserve to do as it did? In other words: was this film really as great as people thought it was before its release?|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available to buy. Can anyone help with a good DVD rip or purchase please? The Blu-Ray version is actually the best I've seen of the movie. I've seen this movie twice in theaters and the Blu-Ray version is better. It's not perfect, but it's still better than most of the crap on the disc. If you want to see this, get the Blu-Ray, or wait a year or two and get it on a budget priced DVD.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster and I love it! I don 't understand how it has received such bad reviews from critics. If you want a great movie to get into, watch it with a girlfriend or wife. Then, you will understand why some people are giving it a bad review. I watched it with a couple of my gfs and we couldn 't keep our eyes off the screen. This is a movie that makes you think. And it makes me want to get out of the rat race.|0
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared , remakes like 'halloween 6' .. and 'red' , but there hasn 't been a scary movie in the last 5 years .. and this one takes place at a time when people didn't watch the news .. so they wouldn't be aware of all the horrible things that were happening .. the 'hannibal' remake was bad .. but this takes the cake . it 's really scary , the story is great , the scares are out of sight , the makeup , special effects are incredible .|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear that many people still hold for the dark side of Italian life. This was the first short film we saw during the Syracuse Italian Film Festival this past weekend and it was the only one I remember seeing during that time frame. I was very pleased with the quality of all the films that I saw this weekend but this one stood out the most. It is not a feature length movie, rather it is simply a series of short segments. We also liked it for another reason.|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the second season and I have a feeling that they would have put him out of a job if he failed to solve these crimes . There was no way that this was gonna end in a tie . So , I was kind of disappointed , but this season is not that bad , I just don't get why people can't just move on to another season , this one has been over for like 6 months . So , I can't wait to see what's gonna happen .|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a large amount of gore is something that’s worth looking into. Among his more famous films is ‘The Beyond‘ and ‘Zombie‘ (both directed by Lucio Fulci) but this one is one that most likely slipped under the radar. I haven’t actually seen the film yet (it has been in the Netflix queue for quite some time), but based off what I’ve seen, I’m definitely going to.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how much she would be speaking to the viewers as her character is a bit of an enigma . I've been trying to figure out how Elizabeth is going to die in the season finale because she doesn't appear on the show after that, and I'm guessing she will just be dead of course, but it looks like she will be dying in that episode, so that will probably be my only chance to figure out if it's really her , unless they do the flash forward in season 3.|0
"The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . ""The Apple Tree"" is written for the Broadway play ""A Little Night Music"" which starred Mary Martin , Barbara Cook and Richard Chamberlain. It is a very sweet story about finding the true meaning of love. I love this music. It makes me think about what it means to love someone. I don't think the song is meant to be taken that seriously. It is kind of humorous, and I think that's why it worked so well."|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was given such an unimportant role . He is very likable , though , and gives a fine performance . A great story that has a lot of depth , and is well acted. It's a good thriller with a very interesting premise . I think it's a good story , and I'm very glad that I saw the movie . The movie is very good in every aspect , though it seems like the director made a lot of changes to the original book .|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
"Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book a few months ago, I realized I could write a book in English on the same subject.

' The machine ' was written in Brazil in the 1980s, so this book must be translated to be read in English. There are many other languages, as the original book is in Portuguese. It's a good read if you want a good laugh. In short, the book describes in detail how a machine was created to control all human functions, including sleep, memory, digestion, etc."|0
"I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with much of what is said in these reviews , except one thing - ""Lost Horizons"" is a science fiction film . ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a science fiction film . I don't think there is a great deal of difference between them , except that ""Lost Horizons"" is more about the future of humanity ( and by extension, more about mankind ) and ""The Poseidon Adventure"" about the past of mankind, the time when life on Earth changed."|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , especially as it was a genre that was never really taken seriously before Scream. Now, many independent horror directors and screenwriters are really getting a chance in Hollywood ,and that's a great thing for us horror lovers . Here are our top five favorites for your viewing pleasure. 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street - A Nightmare on Elm Street was a perfect example of how NOT to make a sequel. The director had already proven he could make a scary film with Dreamcatcher .|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering of love . ``

Cast: Maggie Gyllenhaal , Sam Waterston , John Hurt , Christopher Eccleston , Richard Dreyfuss , Laura Linney

Director: Stephen Frears

Rating: **1/2

What it's about: Two very different people whose paths cross. What it's really about: The triumphs and travails of a happy couple in the real world. It's really a love story, which is a good thing since Maggie Gyllenhall and Sam Waterston don't exactly have high expectations for their marriage."|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this was that the cast did a pretty good job of playing the parts . Some of the parts that i like , i did not n't care for . Like i said, it was funny . I do n't think that this movie will be as well remembered as the first . I do think it will make more of a splash with kids and adults as the first did . It has a couple of good parts to it , but it is not really worth it .|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you might not know who i was talking about . I have read that he is considered by some , to be the original American , if not the originator of the concept of the American dream . This character has many faces , but in my case , I am talking about the character of the American boy . I am not talking about real American boys because I have not grown up in a country that is considered the home of America , to say that my parents are American , it’s impossible .|0
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be rather clever, and the characters had enough depth to be sympathetic. I enjoyed the story and enjoyed the humor. I would not want to know the ending, so I am not giving it away. I had some difficulty understanding the first paragraph, but after I re-read it a few times (and a few times more before I could finish the book), I thought it was fine. The book was a little bit on the violent side, but I didn't think it was overly violent.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that there should be more of a story here, rather than such a rushed, rushed, hurried, hurried episode (even though that was the intent and purpose) with only 2 or 3 plot points at the most. In fact, I'm pretty sure that if the series had followed the same course as the episode, it may have been as successful as that one. It was such a fun episode, and I'm so glad that I was able to see it in it's entirety.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not that's alot more then the movie itself was . I would have give this movie an A+ but that's just my opinion. I don't know how many people would watch that much to know if it was a bad movie. I would say everyone who liked it would watch the movie in its entirety. And for people who didn't like the movie but watched it it would be for the music . I know a lot of people like the music .|0
"I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully crafted play, very well acted and directed. I also think it may be the most important theatrical experience I've had in a long time. If you're curious why, here are the reasons why you should watch this film, followed by my notes:

Reasons to watch Signs of Life, and why I'd recommend it:

1. Because it is the best film I've seen in a long time. If you'd like to learn more about the theater arts, this is a film to watch."|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would be rated R until I was well into my 20's. As an adult, I've found that I can't make a vow to myself like that and I've seen quite a few movies that would have been rated R under my 10 year-old's definition of what a movie should be. Today I'm going to list off a handful of the movies that I've seen under my age 10-13-14 year old standards and let me know your thoughts.|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the film. It is a fact that there are some horror films so great that it can be almost difficult to pick the best from the best. In fact, it has often been the subject of debate on horror-movie buffs sites, with the general consensus always leaning towards the original, or at least to one of the best horror movies from a certain year, such as The Blair Witch Project. This year there are a number of great examples from the sub-genre, making for an even more exciting and varied list.|0
"This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of its lead actor, Robert Goulet, and director, Richard Lester, and the way in which it told the story of Bob Dylan's rise to the top of the charts of American pop music in a way never before attempted in a rock biopic . The title of the film, ""Don't Look Back"", is taken from the song ""With God on Our Side"", by Bob Dylan, written and sung by Dylan, and on the film's soundtrack album, by Goulet ."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life and worked there for years, so it was a pretty big deal to me when they first came in 1972 and made that movie here on Ocracoke. A few years back, they did another movie, called “Pirates Of the Atlantic” and they filmed some of the movie here on Ocracoke, so I have a special interest in it now. It is always fun to see them come in. I usually see one or more of them when they are filming.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a museum or a theatre and enjoy a show, they deserve it. They should be able to see this show if they want, but it's their choice and they should pay the ticket. If they want to see something else, then they should pay the ticket too. They should be a little more mature about life and do their research, or they're just stupid and should be ashamed of it. I'm a musician, but I'm not stupid.|0
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it in our local independent cinema. I don't usually go for foreign films but decided to give the local cinema's showing of this a try. I'm so glad I did as it was very well made and very good story telling. A nice change from the usual Hollywood blockbusters. It's a very well-crafted story. I like the look of it very much. The story line is interesting, the characters are well-defined. I like the way that they used the setting to build the story.|0
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from object and subject . The love of the parents for their children is `` unconditional '' while the love of children for their parents is not . But , is the love of the children for their parents any less unconditional ? To say otherwise is to condemn parents to their own self - condemnation . I have never met a parent who loves their child any less , and yet , many parents feel guilty because their children hate them or vice versa.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in an accident and are thrown into jail . They 're on trial because they don 't pay their bills on time . However , this doesn 't mean they got to go to jail . The only way they can save themselves is by killing the lawyer and his secretary that they 've hired to defend them . They hire a hit man to do the job . They pay him a lot of money . They also give him the car he 'll drive and a gun to use to kill their lawyer and the secretary .|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , but it has been quite a bit since I have seen the ocean. I am a bit worried that if we have an emergency and need to jump at sea I would be of no use to the Sea or Navy as I have no experience in jumping at sea. I am open to the idea, I just do not want it to be on a Sunday morning. Just thought I would put that out there. Just be ready to go.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 when I saw it in 1954 and I didn’t know much about her other than she was famous as an actress for her beauty. Lana was an Academy Award winning actress before she became a star. She began making movies when she was just 19 and I watched her dance and sing in this movie. I have seen a lot of old movies and when I saw this one, I was so taken by the dancing. It was the best dancing in the movie.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's . I had not been aware of it until a couple of years ago and had never seen the likes of any of these actors or actresses before then either . This film had all the ingredients of one of the best crime films that I had ever seen , it had all the right ingredients , it had style , it had an incredible soundtrack and it had a story , and I had never seen before in any other film that I had ever seen .|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to understand there is a very fine line between being funny and being offensive. There's also something wrong with the people who can't laugh at themselves. I thought it was good that you posted it here. I do not know where your from but I will say that some people in America and even in my country of the UK do not take the time to read a joke before posting it. Some people are too ignorant to know when they are wrong.|0
This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters. This was originally released in the United States on September 25, 1964, by Universal International Pictures and Universal Studios. The film was one of a trio of films (the others being What's New, Pussycat?) released to capitalize on the film Pussycat, which was released a month earlier on August 24, 1964. There was no soundtrack album for the feature, as it was not meant to have one. The film soundtrack was released to record stores on October 8, 1964.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary documentary. He talks with scientists from all over the world who work in the sea, to understand what makes the sea animals move. He also interviews scientists who study the sea animals that he describes as being his life-long fascination, such as deep sea divers, fish, squid, jellyfish, and coral. It is not surprising that the documentary is divided into 5 chapters and has subtitles in many languages, including French, Spanish, Russian, German and Chinese.|0
"Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll see one. 1 of 9 - +1 +1 Share this review Google+ 0





There were two people in this movie. They were a young man and woman. I'm not entirely sure who they were. I know what the young man was. I think I knew the girl. But it wasn't much I could put into words, and I didn't even think I had any thoughts to write. I just sat and looked. And then I started to laugh."|0
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it was very clever . The picture has an original style . The plot is simple but clever . The characters in the film are so real . A lot of the things that happen are so simple but are written in such a witty and funny way . A great comedy film that you will laugh at more than once . The characters in the film are so clever and funny . Everything that happens is written in such a witty and smart way . One of the wittiest comedies ever made .|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It was a very tough call . I really enjoyed watching all of them . So sad it ended so soon , but I am very excited to see what their future holds . I think they can be successful with all their potential . I really liked this season because I got to see so many different styles of design. All the contestants were talented. Unfortunately, there are only two artists left, so it is probably over now.|0
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a college scholarship. His academic record is poor, and he does not get along with his parents, who are divorced. Bartleby spends the summer at home, working a low paying, menial job in his father's shoe store. To help make ends meet, he begins to sell drugs to a high school football star to raise money for his dream of attending college. At the same time, he falls in love with the pretty daughter of his boss.|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) is amazing in a way that makes you feel that you know these people who are on the screen and that they are not actors but the real people who are living on these streets . One of the most powerful movies on drug abuse in America . One of the few films to deal with the issue of drug addiction in a realistic manner . The music of the soundtrack is wonderful . The story line is powerful enough to make you think that it happened in your own family .|0
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and upbeat songs such as , ‘ Oh ‘ Baby , ‘ Not Fade Away ‘ and ‘ Not Dark Yet ‘. I think that his songs are very infectious , as I remember playing them in my car in my twenties and thirties as I would sing them and then laugh as I would look at the clock as I knew that the minute I turned the ignition , the car would start and then I would sing more.|0
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do The Thinking '' or something like that. I 've never heard it . I have heard a lot of quotes of it but I never really heard the whole song because I was so busy looking at the action and what was going on . I 've heard a song called `` They Do The Thinking '' , that was playing in a bar . It was probably the same thing. In the second and third transformation , can anyone identify the music ?|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was a kid, and I got to see it several times during that period, so I’m pretty familiar with the film. But the first time I ever really saw it, and actually experienced it, was when it came out on DVD in the early 2000s. It was during the summer of my senior year of high school. We were sitting in the back row of a movie theater that showed all the movies for $5.00 a pop.|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it but the movie is too slow moving and not at all exciting at least for me . As a person who likes action it was difficult to stay interested . I found it boring . I was expecting more and I found more . The main problem is the screenplay . The dialogue is very weak and the screenplay has a lot of repetitions . In the end there is no surprise . This movie was not so good . In my opinion this movie was much better a few years ago when I saw it .|0
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more or less a comedy . however , it turns out to be more of a horror movie as well as a fantasy . the boys ( jason patric ) , two 11-year-olds from a rural area of north carolina , fall in love with the girl they think is a ghost . the girl is actually a very strange , evil witch . after a few nights spent in the house with her , they decide to stay for good .|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time in a month! As I did last time I will say that it's a well shot and edited film though I didn't like the main character very much. He's a very arrogant and irritating character and I think the film would've been a lot more interesting with someone else as main character. The basic story of the movie is pretty interesting but I think it got really boring after a while for me because the film has some very stupid moments.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another in a string of tough-guy action films that has been in steady supply for the past three decades or so. But the picture is much deeper than that. It’s actually the most important film in Bronson's career by a considerable margin. More than that, if you take away the fact that the character of Bronson plays his part in what amounts to a religious war, he plays his part with complete sincerity and conviction.|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series on DVD. It was also shown in syndication in reruns. I would highly recommend a view of it to anyone interested. As far as the first series of Outer Limits, yes the original series is worth a watch, but you might as well watch reruns as much as I do. The stories are a bit dated. The Outer Limits will always have my favorite episodes and stories of all the original series. It is still a favorite for many.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . . . in fact the only thing the two Kerseys have in common is the surname. This article is a sequel to this article , but does not contain any new information, merely an analysis and interpretation of the original Paul Kersey and the Death Wish character as it appears in the novel and film. This is a sequel of sorts because it was only after seeing the original Paul Kersey as he appears in the book that I decided to start studying and writing my original Paul Kersey profile.|0
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if this was a B movie but this is supposed to be one of the best thrillers ever made . In the first 20 minutes the action is so intense and the acting and cinematography so realistic that one has a feeling that one is actually in a scene of the film . The story is very well structured and if you are not aware of some things in the beginning, you will be a little confused but then you will understand .|0
This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as the scene where the doctor talks to a doll while giving it an injection. I am a huge horror fan and there is not a single scene in this movie that is scary. The only one I could remember is when Chucky and Tiffany are making love when Chucky tries to strangle her. But other than that the whole movie was very funny. I just wish it had been a movie all in one day. I was a bit disappointed in how long this movie was but it was a good laugh.|0
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULDN'T have been done that way . But I can 't help but wonder how it would 've been with a different scriptwriter ! And with a different production company ! And with a different director ! And a different cast ... . And a different studio ! ... . And a different movie ! ... . But you get my point. So what 's it like to be a writer ? And how 's it different from a painter , an artist , a designer or a musician ?|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns, guns, guns, and more guns ! The acting is brilliant, and it brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'the 80s' and what the 80s truly meant. I give this movie 10 out of ten stars, and it is a very rare movie that I watch on a daily basis, as it just keeps you entertained and wanting more. If you are looking for an 80s masterpiece, or looking for some great 80s comedy, you can do a lot better then this movie.|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast

I saw this play in London when it opened in 1991 - and it's one which has never left me, particularly the final scene. I was too young to understand the play back then, but I do now, and what struck me even more was a film I'd seen just the year before, starring Tom Wilkinson (who, it seems, was an old student of mine at Bristol - I can't remember why)."|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing' which was actually the original title. The reason I got the tickets was because I have always had a soft spot for Ireland and was really looking forward to the film. This was because I had never seen an Irish film before, not because I've never been to Ireland. I went to Ireland in the summer last year with the rest of my family. I was only there for one day though and didn't go on any holidays.|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest until the very end . Great characters , solid plot and an ending that will have you scratching your head and smiling . This was the first post-apocalypse film that I'd ever seen and I must say, I love it . I am not a fan of films about zombies at all but I just couldn't put this one down . It is fast-paced , funny , and full of heart and I loved it ! I would recommend this one to anyone that has a taste for post-apoc films !|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
"From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the beginning. The first couple minutes or so were good, but after that it never really took off. The concept is interesting but the characters (mainly Jack Black) were a little too broad and over the top to the point of being unbelievable. I know this was a big hit for Jack Black, but there's just too many times I wanted to ask the writers, ""Where's the movie in here? There are no real obstacles or challenges for him to overcome."|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a musical side show ( which was not the truth ) so it is not that surprising to me they got their asses kicked in the ratings war for the ages. But it is just so damn funny how people try and hold them up as if the 70's TV phenomenon was their sole accomplishment. They were a TV phenomenon, and the TV show was only the first wave of a wave that started in the 70's .|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. One night the Duchess goes out to do her business and she gets caught by the gardener who fucks her doggy style. This gardener also comes into the house and they do some really hot fucking. Finally, the gardener cums over the duchess and she gives him a nice blowjob to swallow the cum. She is the most popular girl in town. A group of horny young ladies have made their way down to a secluded place in their hometown to practice for their exams.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written for television and directed and produced by Jonathan Miller . The show premiered on the ITV network on the evening of Friday 3 March 1974 . It was seen as a critical success , though the reviews were mixed and there was little commercial success when it aired. An American version aired on ABC in January 1976 , but it did not feature the original cast or music. A radio version , based on the original novel , aired in the U.S. in 1979.|0
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and it's not available on the streaming services ), but I finally found it. I remember seeing it at the theater when I was kid and it was the first PG rated movie I've seen ( at least up to that date ) so I remember being impressed. The premise is that a boy named Billy Batson ( the kid that turns into a superhero ) travels through time where he finds that the villains of his youth are still about and want to steal his powers.|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission. There are so many things I liked about this movie , it would be hard to list them. 1. The concept of this movie is good , as it revolves around three people who meet by chance at a small college. There is a mystery surrounding the people , but it is so well presented , that you never even think it is going to have anything to do with the murder which happens in the end.|0
"First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this problem. So if you think that my comment is useless , you are wrong. As kittiwake said, it is not a bug , but a limitation . And the fact that it is reported as ""bug"" just reflects the way that most people (me included ) think that it should be fixed . It is not fixed . It is still in development . It will never be fixed , unless there are enough users that find it acceptable enough that it gets the attention of the developers."|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 , if not top 10 movies in my opinion. It is very emotional and at times even a little disturbing. This movie is about how a mother tries to do everything to protect her daughters from harm , but her daughter is murdered by a madman . She is heartbroken and tries to find answers , but not even her daughter's friends know what really went on in the girls life. This is a very good movie to watch with friends or family.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . I will say this to start. The acting is really good and the writing is pretty good too. It's well acted but I didn't understand it very much. The story is pretty much about a man working at a factory who goes off on vacation. I was confused because it seems he goes on vacation every year. Then at the end it says he died in the war. So I was a bit confused about it.|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just fine in my book. I'd rather have an Oscar winning film based on a bad book, then a bad book with Oscar winning actors acting out it. Not that Paris Hilton is an Oscar winning actress but she was part of a series of movies that were well written and made a good movie. I guess I'm still waiting for it to air on DVD to watch. I also hope for more movies and TV series based on books.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another film so similar . It ' s a cult classic . It ' s a must for anyone who 's never seen a sci fi movie . Its a story about two friends , both scientists , who are sent by NASA on a mission to the moon . They go there , and one of the scientists dies . There 's a funeral , and the guy that 's in charge says that the deceased will be able to go into a new space ship , and that 's the ship that will be launched to Mars .|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with strong characters . The film tells the story of four friends who share a close friendship in the early part of the 1970's. It begins in 1968 and shows how the three main characters in the film get involved in a series of unfortunate circumstances that lead to the tragic events of the end of the 1960's and then of the 1970's. This is an excellent movie and a great film to watch with friends and family at the cinema .|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. Harishchandra (Bharath) is the king of Hastinapore. At the time this film was made, in 1936, India had not yet achieved Independence. The film begins with King Harishchandra being crowned by his subjects. The scene then shifts back to Harishchandra at his father's deathbed where his mother urges him to put aside his selfish ways. Hari is then taken to his mother's chamber where he sees his stepmother in bed.|0
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it . it's got a pretty standard story , and is pretty simple to follow . but it has some good things about it , especially for an early 90's film . the first thing I liked is the soundtrack . although it is a pretty generic one for a film of this kind , it still is pretty good . it's quite a catchy one , as it has some great rock tracks that really fit the movie .|0
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film in the works . It was an adaptation of the French comic strip about the adventures of an ex-Nazi agent. The film was being made as a comedy and a satire of Cold War spy thrillers. This was going to be a serious and serious comedy. The director was Peter Bogdanovich , whose previous credits included A Guide for the Married Man . The screenwriter was John Berry , who would later become famous for The Last Picture Show and Chinatown .|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. This is the story of a Don Quixote in the 21st century , who is unable to find a place to live , or a family, or a lover. . He has no family. No job. He spends his days walking around the streets of the town of Apt , dreaming of Sancho Panzas , who he believes to be the real Don Quixote. It is the story of an unspoken world , where he lives among us , a world that exists outside our own .|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks and found this one one of the best, not that I thought it wasn't but I 'd not read anything about it beforehand. It's a bit odd in the sense of it coming at us so suddenly and so suddenly we 're taken out of the mundane world of zombies and the everyday world into an otherwordly, strange dimension . Our main characters in this film are the people in the small farming town that has been plagued by zombies for three weeks.|0
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and many others . It is all so wonderful that I do not see how it can fail to become the classic of its genre. The script is just wonderful and I would say the movie deserves to be one of the classics of the 1970s. If you are an American who lives outside the United States you can see it in cinemas across the World. This movie is about an English professor ( Jonathan Pryce ) , who is a widower.|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really seem to make much sense at all , the way Columbo is just asking and asking and n't really getting any answers. It all seems a bit too easy , Columbo is not going to let it all drop , but he has no answers , so he just goes through the motions , then it turns out to be the girl herself who did it ! The only interesting character in the story is the butler , but he is just used to give Columbo something to do and then he gets himself killed !|0
"I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video reviews, and also a lot of other useful info. The only downside I see about it is that it is really short so I have to fast forward to catch things. I also enjoy watching videos on YouTube, but I don't see them for free because I don't want my cable bill to go up, which is a shame. But that's another topic. Anyway, it's a nice show and I watch it every day and highly recommend it to anyone."""|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be understood from the story of the nativity of Jesus. The word that I want to emphasize here is rebirth which has an important meaning for this subject. Rebirth means the return of the light in the dark, it means the return of the human to the divine, the return to divinity or the re-enchantment of the world, this is a very important concept and this is the one that we will find in all the cultures of the world.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933 she was considered one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood. Her first hit was the movie A Guy Named Joe in 1939 with James Cagney , a movie you probably have not seen if you are reading this as I have seen it. Later that year, when I was a young lad of 12 she starred in a movie I had to watch at the local movie palace. It was a thriller that I had not heard about, but I knew there was a girl in danger.|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I have seen a lot of movies over the last years but this is the one I watched the most . It’s a great movie with a lot of tension and the characters and the settings were really realistic . It’s got a lot of things going for it . A great script , great director , great acting and great music . This is one of those few movies that really made you feel it .|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick , Steven Spielberg , Federico Fellini , Martin Scorsese , Akira Kurosawa , Jean Luc-Godard , Pedro Almodovar , Woody Allen and many others took us on new journeys of fantasy and dreams . One of the most fascinating and intriguing period in film industry is the 1960s . If you look at the filmography of that decade you will realize that many great films were produced in those ten years. Here are some of the best movies of the 60s .|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake about it that the story is compelling enough and the characters are well drawn enough that this can only be a good thing . there are moments of great tension and even suspense in a movie that has been made so well that i could not look away . the film is beautifully shot . the direction is quite good even though it sometimes is not quite what you think it was going to be like . it keeps you interested right from the beginning .|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Kachy. Jules Verne is the most talented writer from the 19th century. The author of the famous book `` From the Earth to the Moon ``, he was born on the French island of Jersey in 1828. He is considered the father of the science and technology and the science-fiction literature. He is also the father of the cinema. The novel was published in the first half of the 19th century. It was a great hit.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put on a good show in theatres across the country. Mumbai: The buzz about the Hindi remake of Hollywood's Black Hawk Down is already being created. It's being talked about as the first of the kind, as Bollywood has never before made a film from an original screenplay. It has been shot in India, with Indian actors. It has already been dubbed in Hindi for the masses and is expected to become a major hit.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face for most of the movie, even though it had no jokes. It was a beautiful story about the power of friendship and trust. This movie has everything that I expected from a Disney film and more! The animation is incredible. Every character has a distinct personality and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous! The storyline is well written. ""The story is based off the true events of a friendship between two boys from New York who become stranded in the wilderness of Alaska after their plane crash."|0
"The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . I just loved this movie. When I saw it in the cinema I was like ""Oh my god ! This is a musical ! "" It was one of the best things of the 70's . The music of this movie is fabulous . It was the kind of thing I dreamed of when I heard that John Barry was composing the music for the movie . And when I read the script it was the same thing . This was one of the best musicals of the 1970's ."|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? There is only one James Bond. As a disabled child, I was treated like a freak. No one took any interest in what I could not do. I was ignored, bullied, laughed at and teased. I was bullied on a daily basis and had no friends because everyone in the school could not understand that I could not read or write. I had no idea how to interact socially and was labelled an idiot.|0
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly balanced combination of romance , comedy and drama . starring julie meade , luke wilson and taylor swift as herself , this is the story of caribe , a small town in the south of usa , where a beautiful girl falls in love with a man , but has no chance to meet his family . while caribe's residents think they know her , they are actually only interested in her beauty . and since caribe has no real-life love stories , it is decided to set one in this film .|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact, they've never been better . With Black Sabbath 's 10th studio album release , ""Heaven and Hell,"" the quintet of Ozzy , Tony Iommi , Geezer Butler , Bill Ward , and Oliver "" Geezer "" Goldstein still sound as potent as ever . Ozzy Osborne , the original lead singer of Black Sabbath , was asked by Rolling Stone how he feels about being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ."|0
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the dough he needs. He can not afford to pay his wife and he can not seem to support the children of his mistress. While this film does not have the comedic flourishes of “The Gold Rush,” “The Kid,” or the “The Tramp” we get a deeper look into Charlie’s character in a darker setting. We find Chaplin playing a character unlike any of his previous tramps.|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew stranded on a hostile world where the crew and the world are on the edge of a major war. It's one of those Trek episodes where the story is strong , but the acting is pretty good . This is one of the first episodes of Star Trek , in which the crew is in peril . They find a world on which a major war has begun , and it seems they are caught in it . The episode is written by D.C. Fontana , based on a story by Lawrence Block .|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most people knew the name John Irving for one book. I didn't know about Garp 's life story, but I had a general idea that he was this great author who had won all of the awards and everything. John Irving was not a great writer by any stretch, and I think that if I had to name someone who is more deserving of the title 'best American writer ever,' I would have to say that Kurt Vonnegut was the best writer ever.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , but this is the best! This is a very good action/ adventure story that will keep you hooked . It's really very good! . You can tell that the special effects were amazing in the 70's . I don't think there will be anything better in my lifetime . There is some good humor in here . The cast is good , but they are not known stars . But they get the job done . There is very little nudity , and that's what makes it fun .|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and it actually isn't that way. It is about the system itself, and how it's been corrupted for the sake of money and greed. It's about how the system doesn't protect the innocent, and how those at the top can take advantage of anything and everything. The movie has an interesting structure with a plot that starts off as a typical police procedural, but soon evolves into something more dramatic as the movie moves along.|0
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
"Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce more shows than can find a way onto a network? If so, what has that done to the traditional broadcast networks and to the development of new programming for them? In other words, should we worry about how much money is being spent on TV shows that can't find a home on broadcast TV? ""I can't speak for anyone else, but there have always been a small number of good TV shows."|0
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling that is delivered through each and every scene is a breath-taking experience to witness and enjoy. There is a great variety of shots from wide to extreme close-up to medium to medium long shot. The cinematography is simple but effective. You get to enjoy the story without any clutter. There is a very good story line to the movie but I wouldn't say that the film is perfect in any way. The pace is good and the plot is predictable but still worth watching.|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly surprising in places . but before it can be fully appreciated and understood , you will have to dig through a lot of subplots to get to the point . there is no clear beginning , middle , or end , which is not always a bad thing ( but it certainly is here ) , although you can't help but wonder what the story is , since the ending seems to have been written by someone who has forgotten it .|0
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause it came out in the mid-70 's . I think I saw this back when it was first made. It's a very powerful movie that makes you think about your own life. I always think of it whenever I think of my mother's suicide. In some ways, this movie is what she wanted for me. I think you should see it, especially if you've ever considered suicide. It will help you decide if you should continue on.|0
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or even any kind of social comment. It is as if no one was there and it was just made for the pleasure of being made. It seems to be something just for a couple to do, nothing else, just what they want to do (or in the case of the actors, what they think they want to do) nothing else. The whole thing is like going to a party where you don't know anyone, it is empty, void.|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. I laughed more in this movie than in any other film in a while. A movie that has everything, great acting, and a good script. This movie made me happy. This movie was very well done. A lot of people didn't like it, saying it wasn't dark enough and that it was predictable but I loved it. This is definitely the best movie that I have seen. This is one of the most underrated movies of all time.|0
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of what it means to live and breathe Jesus Christ , His words and His ways . What I loved most about it , apart from being an easy watch , is that it has some really great messages within , and it makes you ask the right questions , and seek answers within the Bible . This series will definitely make you think , even though you might not agree with some of its views . It also makes you re-evaluate , what it is you think about in life .|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on the planet. There are some amazing scenes to see. I was a bit surprised, however, to find out there wasn’t much of a narrative to follow. The only reason I kept watching this series was to see what kind of footage they could capture underwater, and I was thoroughly disappointed with that aspect. I’d recommend it to anyone that’s intrigued by what it would take to be an explorer.|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen so far , and probably one of my favorites as well . as you might have guessed already , it is , without any doubt , a very moving movie , even though the true story has its own tragic ending , it is an inspiring tale about a man with a big dream and an incredible determination . the movie is based on a real event , and it depicts some parts of it , the main character , Gerrit Wolfaardt ( robert schmidt ) , who is one of my favorite characters in movies .|0
These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , not a movie ! The movie was made to make people think about their future , how they will be taken advantage of , how they are going to lose everything they have , but the people who make these movies always think about themselves , not other people . This is one of my favorite movies , and one of the only movies where i was able to understand what was happening . And the acting is amazing , but the most amazing thing about the movie is its message .|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
"Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ) , the movie version of the cult sci-fi TV series Star Wars may not be remembered as the best of the franchise . It is true , however , that despite its faults , this is still the most accessible film in the Star Wars series . And , as far as I'm concerned , it doesn't really need the name "" Star Wars "" ; the movie alone is an enjoyable action / adventure / comedy / fantasy / action -adventure film ."|0
"The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World ( United States ) in the early 20th Century. My father's great grandparents came to the USA in 1907 from Sicily . This is their story and I hope to be able to tell it well. Sunday, April 26, 2010

I have been busy working on the next chapter in the saga of ""The Golden Door"" so here it is in all it's unedited glory. It has been a good day."|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it more if it ' d been on late night television , but the first time I saw it I was with my mother , my sister , her boyfriend and his friend , who were all in college . I liked the cast , the setting , the atmosphere . I felt like I was in a real movie . The main character of the movie is a high school teacher named Jack Torrance . He ' s had a problem with his stepdaughter , Wendy Torrance (played by Wendy Robie ).|0
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this movie. I don't know why this movie didn't get more attention when this movie came out , because the acting was really good . I can't wait to watch this on Blu ray. I am glad I didn't get this movie on DVD, because this one is better in my opinion. I have always had an affection for this film. It was made on a very small scale, it was filmed on location with a very small budget.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. I've just finished watching all the documentaries we saw and have written a brief summary of each. I'll add some links at the bottom if anyone's interested, but I wanted to try and sum up what we felt were the essential takeaways from each film. If you have seen these movies, you will understand why I feel like I did after last night's, but I wanted to share this with everyone as an opportunity to raise awareness for these films and the issues they portray.|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched it in Chinese and i thought to myself ""This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen ! I have no problem with it being dubbed in English!"" The characters are all very likeable and i'm sure that this will have a very big audience ! The plot is basically a family story where all the main characters have a great sense of humour and they're able to see a lot of humour in the things they go through, even the things that they don't realise they do go through."|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
"As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does not seem to know where it 's going or how to tell its story . even in the worst films , it's possible to tell the audience what 's going on . here , what we are supposed to be observing is a romance between two men , with a bit of plot thrown in . so the title is not really the best choice . we are given , as the first clue to what this movie is about , the tagline "" love can come in all sizes . """|0
"`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers meeting and having a blind-date-type experience on the first day of the festival. '' I was pretty nervous as to what I had to say, or who I had to answer to. When I heard about the show, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

'' I'm the host of an unscripted talk show about blind dating called Blind Spot. '' '' It's really the most fun I've ever had on stage."|0
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are shown here in this film are so surreal they will blow you out of your chair! This film will leave you stunned, amazed and in awe of the amazing beauty of Earth and the wonders of our Solar System. This is the must see documentary of the year in my opinion. As someone who has been to space I know that the images we see in some of the documentaries that I have seen on television and the internet just don't do the real thing any justice at all.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of my all time fav series ! I love how the whole cast is from all corners of the globe . There are no cliches . I am very proud of the fact that this show is a bit different , in a good way and I'm not ashamed of it . The story lines and the characters are just great . I just finished watching this show for the fifth time already and I haven't been able to stop watching this series .|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but the movie was good , I liked it . For starters , I like Sam Elliot , and this movie gave him the chance to show off how talented he is , and he played it perfectly . There is a lot of humor in this film , but not too much . I would say the best part about it , and the reason I am mentioning this , is because when the movie is done , you get to watch an awesome ending that will have you happy that you watched this .|0
"Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar threatens to turn them over to the authorities

They’re no ordinary cats. They’re Duchess, Duchess, Duchess of Windsor, and that makes them something in the realm of royal cats. Duchess is a tiny tabby-striped beauty, but the trio of black-and-white kittens are the real stars. They’re adorable, they’re fluffy, they’re funny-looking and, like their mum, Duchess of Windsor, they look like royalty. What more could you ask for?"|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them in years. Yeah, and I liked that he took the time to let us see how these people live, and how he showed us how they're not just a bunch of zombies, but there's still some humanity in them. In a way, that makes it feel less like The Last Stand than any of his other films, but in another, it really doesn't feel that way, because in The Last Stand, at least, he had zombies.|0
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things I had not had chance to say before. And so, here we go.Chucky is just that. He is just what he looks. He is an animated doll with a mask that is painted on him. And this is what makes the real difference. In the new series, he now has a clear and defined body. He is no longer an abstract doll with a mask. He has a defined and recognizable form. And that, to me, is a step forward.Chucky is the ultimate killer doll.|0
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is saying ! his message is universal , and i truly believe that he knew he was dying because he knew he had finally found a place to share this message ! he had spent his whole life trying to say this stuff and now that he had an opportunity , it was so important for him to make sure we heard it ! this is a movie i can watch over and over ! thank you josh for your amazing talents ! i love you ! xo !|0
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful title as a cult director. His name is not as synonymous with cult in the 1990s, however. But that does not mean he is not a cult director. Here are some of my favorite films of the 1990s, in no particular order

1) Demons 2) The House by the Cemetery 3) Bloodfeast

2) Demons

I think of the 1980s as a decade where horror movies were largely about slashers, and the 1990s as a decade where horror movies took on a more cerebral approach."|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . It was my first movie in a movie theater, but not my last! Here are my thoughts on the film. First, the premise. A young and very talented blind man plays the titular role in Blind Spot. As his blindness progresses, he moves from his native city to a seedy neighborhood, where he becomes the “eyes” of a young woman who had her purse snatched at a bus stop.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
"I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who he was, but I could sense that this was a special film, that it was more than just another movie. My mom had already seen it, and it seemed like it was something we all had already seen. I remember asking my dad, “Why did we all see it?”

That’s when he introduced me to the band that Buddy Holly had been a member of, the Crickets. I thought it was so cool that someone could play music, just like me."|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I think it 's actually a musical) but I found it a tad overrated when I watched it years ago . The plot is that a bunch of teenagers are trying to find themselves and when they can't, they move to an old mansion and get themselves jobs . They have a lot of great songs and of course the comedy . I don't care what anyone says, the comedy is really good and the music and acting is great too .|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . the movie is mainly a light-hearted comedy/adventure with the plot centered around a group of young women who are involved in an exciting adventure of sorts . the women are all from different walks of life with different views on life . the movie is set in new york in july , and focuses on a group of women in their 20's who are going to a party . the party starts and ends up going wild with the women throwing out a few of the party's guests including the host .|0
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a way to open a new decade. You know, at first I found this movie to be kinda funny, but after thinking about it for awhile, I just don't really see how it could be considered a comedy. But whatever. Anyway, I liked it a lot because it was not nearly as silly and boring as I was expecting it to be. And I was pleasantly surprised to find that the characterizations and plot were actually quite good.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about something that was near and dear to me . It was about something I thought about a lot but didn't know how to discuss. It wasn't about politics or the economy. It was about a family. My family. We all watched together. I made us coffee and we sat on the couch together and watched this documentary. I had never talked about my family with anyone and I had never even seen a movie like this.|0
Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But not to worry: Michael Berryman , who portrayed Chucky in the original film, will appear in an all-new sequel . ( For more on this story , check out the April issue of Sci Fi Magazine , out April 25 .) And you can read the interview here on the magazine's Web site . Berryman talked about the Chucky sequel , his other film projects, what he thought about the original film and his reaction to the recent news of Chucky's return .|0
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen . I really enjoyed it a lot . The plot is good and there is nothing that you will not see in the movie , you can not miss it . Also it 's a comedy with a good story . The actors are really good and they do not miss a single thing . They make you laugh a lot , and this is a good thing to see . The plot is not complicated but it 's good and easy to understand .|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen popstar , or 2) a series based on the life of another famous person , like The Real Housewives or Gossip Girl . While it's not all bad , I'll bet the majority of shows you see are just for preadolescent boys and girls. If that's the case , and since there aren 's a whole lot more of the former, here are 5 of the most interesting TV shows that are for young girls. 5.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
"What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of the best TV shows of all time, along with The Twilight Zone which is in my Top Ten Series and I watched this show with the Twilight Zone for years on end. With the first episode, ""The Invaders"", I knew that this was an exceptional show ... And from the very first moment I saw this series, there was no question that I was hooked .... And so I watched this show with a tremendous amount of anticipation for the rest of its run!"|0
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin's best role , he is one of the most endearing, lovable creatures imaginable . Chaplin's ability to portray any kind of animal is incredible , and he made his dog into an unforgettable character . The only thing better about this picture than the performances is the production , which was one of Chaplin's most beautiful . It's one of the best films ever made about people and animals . . . and, yes , this film has a great ending !|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the Meiji period (1868–1912) of the Meiji era. The film premiered on 29 January 2014 at the Japanese cinemas and later released as a DVD on 12 April 2014. It was produced and directed by Masakazu Oguro and written by Makoto Shinkai . Kenji was born in Tokyo, where his father, an art teacher, had taken up work in a printing house in the year of the Meiji Restoration. He was thus raised in an artistic and cultural environment where the arts and education were given equal importance.|0
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I was really thrilled with this flick . Billy’s been in so , so many films over the years , but this might be his best work yet . This was a really touching and funny , heartfelt film . Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were just perfect for the roles . And what was with that scene , where he goes around town telling people that he’s really , really , really into her , only to tell people that he isn’t interested when she walks up to him .|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to France to become a boxer.He fights in many fights and is eventually kicked out for being a bully.He becomes a soldier and fights against the French in the war and is eventually awarded the Military Cross. The film is a must see. A Charlie Chaplin classic, with lots of amusing gags as he plays the various characters he is to impersonate. The most famous one is his famous tramp character. However, this is not the case here and the film does not really have that much comedy to it.|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
"What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here we go (and by the way, have a happy new year)

The first day of a new year is marked by hope. Hope that one day, we may be able to change the past. Hope that this year we may make the change to a better and more positive one. Hope to have good news for all those who have supported and cared for me. Hope for a happy ending for all of you."|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for more information. Then one day, my sister said she watched the film on Netflix, so I did the same. I was hooked from the start and I was fascinated by the different types of people that appeared in the movie and how they were able to get to where they were. It is an excellent documentary that is very easy to watch. I highly recommend this film for people who are looking for a great documentary to watch.|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 30 minutes , it was not nearly as long as some of his earlier short subjects , such as 'A Bushel of Straw' or 'The Kid ' which were nearly forty minutes long ! It was also a very fine film , directed by Chaplin's brother Charles Spencer who was responsible for the direction of some of Chaplin's very earliest shorts . The film is , of course , the story of Chaplin's experiences while he was an ambulance driver during the 1 st World War .|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this. In the meantime, please enjoy this, the last ever episode . It is with a mixture of regret and sadness that this episode is being put to rest . The BBC have decided that their budget is not big enough to show it again and I was unable to find a buyer for the tape and I don ' t know where to get enough money out of the bank to buy it back so that it can be made available to those who have never seen this masterpiece.|0
"I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I attended the film's world premiere in Toronto. In the next month I was offered a chance to read the book before it was published , so I could write its review, which was published in April 2005 in the journal ""Cinema Journal"". That's when I learned that my review was too long , and that I was to rewrite it, and I accepted , so here is what I originally wrote. The book is well worth reading before seeing this film."|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a rare way. There is an honesty in his performance. I didn’t realize he was as good a filmmaker as he is. He is very creative and has a sense of humor. He seems to have a very good understanding of the material. There’s a great story line, too, and a lot of interesting material. He’s a very attractive guy, but there is something very appealing about him. The story is set in the 1980s.|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and what it offers. I liked the fact that the film showed a different side of Greece , one of its more traditional sides, the one you would not expect to see. I also enjoyed the cast and the fact that this film did not focus on any particular person, but gave you the story of a whole country. It was not too long or too boring. I think it is a good introduction to Greece , a country I want to know better.|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the main thing that makes this film so good is it's pure imagination . And the fact that it was one of the first films to use Technicolor . That being said , this is a little bit too long for my taste . I would have liked it to be a little shorter . I mean this is a very good film but there is nothing special in it . The only reason I would recommend you see it is purely for the fantasy and imagination .|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie network , Lifetime Movie Network , The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network , TV Shows on Lifetime, Lifetime , The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network on April 2, 2015 . It is about a college professor who is accused of killing his wife and her lover. It stars Jason George as the lead role . The first 2 minutes are not bad. Then the rest is a bunch of crap. It is a very poorly written TV show.|0
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 or so times I could not bring myself to watch it again. I kept thinking “you will not like this”, and it would turn out to be the case as I would find myself disappointed in it’s story. With that said , I will say I now have the chance to review this film again and see what all the hype has to say . Story-wise I will say the plot is something that is hard to describe .|0
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting ''), I don 't know, I just found it catchy. I read the whole thing...I don't want to repeat it because I enjoyed it so much. But anyway, I know you're probably too busy to respond to this...but you were right, the way I wrote it didn't come across the way I hoped, so I changed the title, and it seemed to come out better.|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I recommend that you take the time to view it and enjoy it. It's a long one, at least 40 min, I believe. It was written by the late, great, Stan Lee . ( Lee wrote many, many, movies and tv episodes as well as comic books, but this is where he really shined!) I will try to keep this as brief as possible - but will give as much detail as time allows me.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (or if you’ve never heard of them, then you definitely need to give them a go), but Motorama is even better, as it features some of the funniest sequences in a desert film that’s been made in decades. This is the story of a group of outcast motorcyclists on a last journey before being buried in an unmarked mass grave. And as you can imagine, they aren’t exactly a happy bunch.|0
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock 'n' roll. Although it was shot in 1979 (and it 's one of the few films that 's actually set in 1976! ), the cast consists of young people in their late '20s or '30s. This is not a feel-good fable. Instead, the story of rock 'n' roll is the main point of interest. Of course there 's the usual clich?s about drugs and rock 'n' roll lifestyle (which I 've already mentioned).|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an amazing mystery about the life of a famous person, who has a wife and a young child, but the wife has suddenly disappeared. When we meet the famous woman in the first episode we see how she is dressed , we are introduced to the other people in the scene and the situation in the life of the famous actress. In this particular case she appears to be living with her husband, and has a young daughter , but it seems that there are other people in her life .|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
"I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times over the years. Finally, I got bored and bought the DVD. Now I'm glad I bought it! I'm an old fan and I haven't seen it for a long while. The movie has aged well and it's still very entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who loves action and comedy!... more

This is an incredible film. I think it deserves more credit than it has, which is saying alot."|0
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would. It's fun to watch, and it isn't boring like a lot of these pre-screenings are. I really liked Rory. I think the movie works really well for him. I was disappointed he didn't have more time to develop, but that's a real movie problem. Also, I was kind of disappointed he couldn't stay a little on screen longer - I think the story really needed him to get involved in more of it.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the necessary ingredients that make a good movie. Good acting, a good script, and some really good scenes which keep the viewers captivated. The problem is that I can't remember many of them. Maybe it's because of the fact that it was an old episode that was a little out of my taste. It was more of an American movie, which is a big turnoff when I watch them. There are only two scenes that I remember in this episode.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad, angry, confused and happy. It was a very emotional film. I have not felt that much while watching a film.I could not understand the ending and the story but it was really touching. It made me very emotional and sad. I really liked the movie, the way it was directed. The acting and music were very good. My favorite part was when Rishi Kapoor's character was talking to his friend. The part where he talked about his father.|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just a story . But you can feel the characters ' sorrow and sadness . It really shows you how good they are . It 's not just some boring movie but you get to know people 's emotions . The story line is great . I like how they make you feel about the characters and how it changes throughout . This is the best I have seen so far . This movie should be in every single person 's collection . This is the best ever . Amazing .|0
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , but I'm pretty sure that you need to be fluent in Italian to dig it. If you '' speak '' it , you 'll see why. It 's really good , and I'm sure that if you get past the fact that the story takes place '' '' during World War II '' '' in Italy , you 'll dig it . It has a lot of really great scenes, and I can 't stress enough how much I adore the fact that the film is set in Italy during that period.|0
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Trenchcoat ''? If you do, then I highly suggest you go play The Dark Eye 2! The Dark Eye 2 has all new classes, weapons, enemies and more! And it's an action RPG too! It's pretty much exactly like the original Dark Eye, except it's even more awesome! There are three new classes, each of which has their own very unique fighting style and abilities that make them feel completely different from other classes and unique from one another too.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it s outstanding performance by Dario Conti . This film was first released in 1969 and was inspired by actual events. The film follows the story of an American soldier named Jack (Conti), who is caught in a fire fight and takes refuge in an African church. However, the church is later bombed by the American military, which leaves Jack alone and injured. He is then carried off by some African hunters and taken back home to America to recuperate.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I think a lot of us could stand to take a Rachael Ray type of cooking style and apply it in our kitchens , right here in the Midwest . Here's to her and to us . . . You're doing great. You'll do much better in the next round, I'm sure of that. You're not going to win the whole contest but the judges will be looking at what you're doing and seeing the improvement over last time.|0
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes place on the other side of the world , a world which , for the most part , seems to consist of one family who are all in some way connected , but not one of the family is aware of the others , and it is not until someone from the family gets into a serious accident , that the whole of the family realise that they are related and that they have been living in an attic , under a pile of old paper , in a city , for the last 40 years or so .|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his mother , who died when he was just a kid. Ja Rule wrote the script. The drama has not been picked up by any networks. ""We've seen some of it. We've seen some footage, but there's nothing really to get excited about,"" he tells MTV News. ""It wasn't something that really came together, it was something that we were thinking about, and Ja Rule was writing it."|0
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . I was impressed by the script . It's not easy to develop a movie based on a book and it's even harder to make a movie out of a comic book and I really liked that . This movie really has a great cast and it looks really good . There's not much of a message in the movie because it doesn't talk about the origin of this superhero but it focuses more on his everyday life and the problems this character has in his personal and professional lives .|0
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to mature, the focus shifted towards darker subjects, including war . However, the writers were quick to realize that the audience was more accepting of a story if they saw the end results , so the episodes became less grim and more optimistic. This shift was evident when the title sequence started with a shot of the audience in the studio, rather than one of the actors on the set. This approach was taken in “ The Man in the Canvas ” .|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy Eddie Murphy gives a comical take on the classic Professor Humbert Humbert as he takes over the role of his son from age of 7 to 10 . With his son away in boarding school he takes over his old role and begins to be a real nutty professor . Will he be caught ? Will he get away with it ? Will he make it out of the college ? Will he have any friends ? What a fun and funny film .|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me the first is he is a good man . He always takes care of people . Even though he lives in a strange country he helps his friend . I 'm sure that he is a good friend to his friend . However , I can ' t understand what 's the reason of his action . He wants to help his friend but he couldn 't . Then what 's the reason ? He is a good , kind person . I think so .|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Sanders and Blackmer , in particular , are simply fantastic. The film has a unique feel , and some of its scenes and performances stand out for me more than others , but overall this was a fun and enjoyable film noir thriller . The film starts with a car accident. We learn that Sanders, a lawyer who has just arrived at a New York court , was driving the car . He survives the crash, and wakes up in the hospital.|0
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , a talented young rapper . Reggie has big plans for his music , but he's having trouble meeting his goals . Because of this , Reggie is constantly in danger . He's been kidnapped by a group of drug dealers who believe he has information on a rival gang . Reggie escapes and tries to hide from his drug dealers . Eventually , he has to go on the run to save his life . The film starts off with Reggie Cooper in jail .|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction was amazing and the performances were good. The film takes place on a small island in the middle of the ocean, which has become home to the survivors of a terrible disaster. There is one ship left that was trying to escape the disaster. In the film, a couple of the people on board who survived the disaster, find the remaining ship and try to take over control of it. They kill the captain, and take the passengers to the island.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere’s story of 15th century piracy in the Bahamas is set in a time and place where we know a lot, and I found myself thinking that I had seen all of this before. There were scenes from this story that were just like the ones I had already seen, and some of those scenes were just horrible in the book. It would be fair to say that the main problem in this movie was that this was an adaptation of a book that I thought I had read before.|0
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this movie a year before, but couldn't make up my mind to tell people about it because of the poor rating and bad reviews. I saw it at a small theater in San Diego. The film has been dubbed in a few languages, which I don't know if they are English versions or not. The basic plot is that a girl, Ananya, is raped by her own father. She kills him and goes to a convent.|0
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Julliette , but then , what opera are they singing? "" The Flying Dutchman "" , no less . . . The story is very simple : a Dutchman lives on a little island near Venice , and a Dutch ship has sunk there . He keeps watch over the ship for years , never seeing the ship again . . . until he gets a surprise visitor , a beautiful young woman . . . But she has come to bring him news , news that will haunt him forever ."|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines and dialogues are perfect for this kind of movie , it is very well made , the music is awesome . The movie tells the story of a girl , who is forced to go to a city , because she is not allowed to see her parents after the marriage . The movie starts with her telling her parents , that she is leaving the city and the movie goes on from there . The scenes are beautiful , I never felt I am watching a Bollywood movie , it is really a good movie .|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. From his role in 'Housefull 3' to his new upcoming release 'Kapoor & Sons' - Ali G is here with yet another hit film 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha'. In an exclusive interview with mid-day, Ali G has opened up about the making of his film and how it was made. Q. Did you think you will get a chance to be in a film after 'Housefull 2'? Ali G: It's funny you mention that.|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
"I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . They look so happy together and you really see it. I wish it was longer so I could hear more of how their relationship is , but I did like it enough to watch it 3 times. I wish I could see this movie again , because it was so good. The best thing to say about it is that it's not so good, but not so bad...

First of all, the plot is somewhat complicated and it takes a good few episodes to make it all clear."|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is an amazing site for cats to learn more about what their catnip toys are and what is really good for them. There are also tons of information about feline health. I've been using it since my two cats came up with severe ear infection and now they're getting better with the ear drops they have been prescribed. It has been a good resource for me since I've been researching feline health on the side. The best part about AristoCats is that it's completely FREE.|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the death of the richest man around. There's a cast of rich and famous Hollywood stars including John Barrymore James Stewart Robert Cummings , and the legendary Boris Karloff who is also the crook mastermind. But there's an even more famous crook in the middle of the plot who is not supposed to die until after the finale and that crook is played by James Stewart! We also learn early on, that Boris Karloff and Boris Karloff's wife were the two most popular crooks.|0

When he gets to the hospital , however , his wife and son are gone and no one is there to meet him . His wife and son have not told him they have a new family in England .|0
"This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in Italy, it follows a detective who has to search for an abducted woman. In his pursuit of the girl, he gets involved with a bunch of people involved in the occult…

One of Fulci’s most interesting films to date , this Italian entry to the slasher boom of the 1980s is full of great visuals and disturbing imagery. After the death of his wife, a man (Lupo Regalino) goes on a quest for justice ."|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the new guy. He comes from outside the region, so his presence is an unknown factor in a place where everyone knows and hates everyone else. After the arrival of a mysterious man in a car, he becomes the focus of interest of the village and its inhabitants. And when they discover who he is, they are also intrigued. But Antônio's mission is to uncover the secrets of this village and those who live there.|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age but I would not have wanted to go through the rest of that year. I knew he was from Missouri and I did not know if he was still there at that point. I did not hear the news until about 2 weeks after his death. It was a shock and I did not know anyone who would have had news of the tragedy in the area. When I saw his picture later I would tell people that he looked like he was having fun.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The film tells a story about two people, a young boy who wants to know where the place called home really is and his mother, who tries to give him the most accurate information she can. They are both on the run and the boy is trying to protect his mother. The narrative is about their journey from one place to another, as the two people travel across a hostile world to finally find their desired place to live.|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 5 is a 1980 movie about a New Yorker , Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) , who travels to Rome for a holiday . After visiting the Colosseum (which we have already been to in the first three) Paul gets attacked by some gangsters with baseball bats . During the attack Paul loses his wife and his son , then the gangsters stab him with a knife . Paul goes to a local hospital for treatment , where he meets a young woman and her sister .|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen all of her films. This is her first movie in ten years , after doing a number of TV plays in the 1960s . She has a great performance here , in my opinion . There are many reasons why this is a wonderful film , including the fact that it is a very romantic love story with an interesting plot twist at the end. I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie. She has a great performance here.|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this movie or you'll be very disappointed. If you are watching this film to watch some fight scenes, then watch it at home, because it's just a boring waste of 2 hours of your time. And the acting is terrible! This is just another one of those 'so bad, it's so good' kinds of movies. It was interesting to me to see what it would have looked like if it were a big budget Hollywood film...|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must admit, when it comes to the recent season, I haven't made it to the current one. I'm sure that I would really like it, but I'm sure that it will be a bit depressing for me. I find that the episodes are always quite good, but I don't ever really get into it at all. I just find that I just don't take it seriously. And I didn't even know about this.|0
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be at the beach. He 's not a pretty face and not a sex symbol. But when it comes to acting and being a great actor, he's tops with me. He is the best actor in the world. I love his talent and I love the way he does things. When he talks about his career or about himself, it 's never about who he was as a young star. It's always about what a good actor and director he is.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was the complete opposite of all the stuff that's clogging up our screens ? Well , that's exactly what this is ! I've watched a few films where the main characters are just plain boring , I've seen films where the plot twists are too obvious , and I've seen films where the story moves so slow , you'll be counting the number of words in a line on your fingers by the time the film comes to an end !|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar as the second victim who is murdered by the second killer, a woman . She has a nice face, nice hair and she had a great performance as well as her costar. She is a nice actress , I think that's why I like her even more , her performance as the second victim . In this Columbo episode , there's a nice twist ending . I like it , it's great , it's interesting and it's very good , I recommend you watch it .|0
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William H Macy , he has such an amazing presence , he just has this aura of charisma . I 've always been fascinated by his persona . This was an excellent film , and i 'm not one to give a film five stars . It was so much better than i expected , and i was really pleasantly surprised . I had the feeling after i saw it that this film was meant for me , that i just wasn 't ready for it , yet .|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer, she had never really performed in the movies in a serious role before. Now she was going to attempt something more ambitious, something more like what her career had in mind . She also needed the money , as she had fallen on hard times with the divorce. She had just finished a seven picture deal with Paramount, but it was only a temporary thing. She was a hot property at the moment, and MGM was interested in her too.|0
"Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse'. Not only was it an enjoyable film, but it also had many funny moments, so I decided to pick out some funny moments from this film and write them up here. Here you go:

Ali G being Ali G - The Movie

Ali G is having an argument with his wife, Aisha. She says that he is a 'spoilt child' because he has expensive toys and he doesn't seem to work. Ali G responds that he is an 'eminent comedian'."|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really '' great '' - it was ok in it's prime but really only a cult series now and a bit disappointing. I was glad to see '' Chucky 's Daughter '' go the same route as the Bride of Chucky - the series did not reach the quality that the original films reached (even though I enjoyed '' Chucky's Curse '). There has been a lot of confusion about this movie. For starters, it has nothing to do with A PUPPET'S PARADISE.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but it was just an OK comedy. It started out well but when Bob started talking about his new car and his new job at the beginning it just dragged on and dragged on and I stopped watching. Not the best movie and not the worst but not funny at all really. The premise of the movie is that Eddie and Bobby have a new comedy talk show. I don't think I can say much else because I watched the whole film with my wife and she didn't think much of it either.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald goes missing and he is presumed dead . He is the only witness of a murder and the police can't prove that the man who killed him was the killer . They go about finding the killer and it turns out they are investigating the murder of Gerald and it turns out that Gerald and the suspect have a connection . It gets kind of weird from there but if you are into crazy conspiracy theories it might just make sense if you are into crazy conspiracy theories .|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
"A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the world’s relationship to nature and the animals who live in it. For those of you lucky enough to see this film in a cinema, I hope it inspires you, and for the rest of us who are lucky to enjoy the film online, may your eyes feast on this beautiful nature.

"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' ending where fate seems to be at work, a crime, and a moral dilemma. In these films, the morality is usually black and white. But as this essay argues, the morality is more ambiguous and the characters are far more complex. Noir films have their roots in the 1930's, but they became prominent in film noir only during the 1940s and 1950s. Many films before the 1940s are not in the genre.|0
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . the plot is a simple one , which is really what made the movie so much fun . it involves the story of a group of criminals who plan a heist involving the theft of $3 . 3 million . it's not until they arrive at the heist's location that the real danger starts to set in , however . they are up against a gang of gunmen who are all out to kill them before they can get what they want from the vault .|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem set in 1930s Paris ( with nods to the Roaring ’20s and Prohibition-era gangsters ) . The film follows a group of young men who band together in a club, and as they spend more time there, they’re gradually lured into various forms of debauchery : they get high, they get drunk, they get laid ( mostly by men ), and they get in fights . It’s all a bit of a shaggy dog story, but the setting is well-rendered and the characterisations are well-paced.|0
"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car video on dvd, it's almost impossible for a DVD to get out now)
I was wondering if anyone knew of a way of downloading the DVD version of a movie (I know you can download the blu ray but I haven't been able to download a blu ray yet)

I have been searching the net for quite a while and all I seem to find is download links but no actual copy of it."|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) , Danny DeVito ( Throw Momma From the Train , Twins ) , and Billy Crystal . It was directed by '' writer/director John Hughes and released by Paramount Pictures in 1995 . '' Showtime '' centers on five New York City high school graduates . At a party to celebrate their graduation , everyone ends up taking drugs . After the party , the high school seniors , who have had a few drinks , drive around the city .|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are amazing . It is so original and has one of the best twists ever in any movie . I think that if you are a horror fan or just a lover of good movies , this is an absolute must have . I have heard a lot of people complain about how the ending was predictable , but for me I did not think it was predictable at all I could tell it was going to happen right from the start.|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : )
This movie was great , it was so exciting , and it kept your attention the whole movie . I liked all the main characters . I would re watch this movie any time it's on. I love the story , the acting , the romance , action , adventure , great soundtrack ! This movie was so good ! The film had a good story line. It kept my attention. The story was exciting and I really got to see and know what happened next."|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is my favourite. I love how each character's personality changes , it's amazing . It's quite sad that it hasn't had a season 13 yet , because I've loved each season since it started . How I Met Your Mother was awesome! I thought the first season was a little boring, because of how it started off with Ted being depressed and stuff, but once it picked up, it was very funny. And now they've introduced the Mother, so it's even more awesome.|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
"This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - but mostly romance . It's a perfect example of what you might call a romantic comedy. The main premise of the movie is the idea that a boy and a girl have a magical relationship. They are ""in love"", but they are also ""not in love"" since they don't have any idea what love is . They just like each other , and that's all there is. One day, a war starts and the boy has to go off to war."|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you like this kind of films , I would definitely recommend watching . I give it a 10 . I give this movie a 9 and it deserves it . I love this film and the whole movie is full of action . This film has really good music and I like that . This is an entertaining film . I give this film a 10 . The only thing is that it could have been longer and that's all . I am very satisfied with this .|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . It was a great book , and a great movie ... But this was the first time I heard a movie was based on it . If I knew the movie was being made , I would have loved to see it in theaters ... As it was , since I had no idea it was going on , I just found a copy on dvd and watched it a few times ... The story is great ... The movie was just ok ...|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first . It's about a kid who died and then was brought back to life only to be tortured to the point of insanity . This is the perfect ending to a perfect first season ! I was completely hooked from the beginning and never wanted to stop watching . I cried at least twice and many many more . It's sad and it's beautiful and I can't believe I never saw this show on the shelves .|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and her inability to express herself freely. One day , when she was on her way home from school , she met a handsome young man who was also going home. He was also a stranger and she was very curious to see his face, but he was shy too and wouldn't even smile. Valeria was puzzled, she was not used to shy men , and he reminded her of something, but could not recall what.|0
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great characters . A bit of suspense and a couple of good twists . A must for all those who are looking for a little inspiration and encouragement . You have made me laugh . I hope to read another one from you as soon as possible to see what I've been missing . Thank you so much for this gift . You made my first experience with the internet a pleasure and I hope it is the first of many . The first of a new series, very good so far .|0
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and heartache that occurs when the family structure is threatened by the loss of a loved one , or the possibility of an unknown future for a youngster , or when the young man or woman chooses a life and an identity outside the home and culture that made them... or the possibility of their never coming home at all . it is the sort of movie that you think and ponder for a long time afterwards , and when it is over , the whole experience has taken up residence within you .|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I have never heard of him before but , he was one of the great actors of that period . He could make you laugh at himself , he could cry , he could give you goose bumps . This movie is based on John Garfield 's true story about his life as a child. The movie begins with a montage about his childhood. Garfield grew up on the streets of Los Angeles and had no real friends or family.|0
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . They perfectly portrayed the emotions of the movie . It was a brilliant script . The director did a terrific job in bringing all the different pieces of the movie together . In that movie I feel like I was part of a big family. I felt that I had been there for the whole movie . There was so much to enjoy . It's a very interesting movie that you must watch . I also liked it because it shows you the way things can be done in life.|0
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save the crew. But i forgot the name of the crew. But they got the crew . And they took the boat. The boat had 2 engines. Then the boat came to a stop . Then i saw that the captain was on top of a hill. And the boat was on fire. Thats all i knew about it. Then Desmond and Penny got off the boat . Then Desmond said good bye. The next scene was with Penny. And Desmond.|0
"The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he had to be smarter than - and in my opinion he was not. The funniest part for me was in the end of the special , after the interview with Michael Jackson . The interviewer said that Ali was the funniest , then Ali said ""That's a lie"" and turned to Michael, then he asked Michael if he thought he was the funniest of all and Michael said ""I think I am."" And that's how it all started."|0
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it, well that’s a real bummer. Paris Hilton was one of the girls I was hoping would be in this film. So I am very disappointed in that. The film has been criticised for its lack of plot and lack of focus on the main character and that’s something I definitely didn’t agree with. It felt a little rushed. The film’s plot revolves around two women and what happens in Paris when she gets into her car.|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira in “The Addams Family”. I think I remember hearing that she was a big fan of the show but didn’t have the opportunity to play a part until now. The girl playing the little girl’s doll was also in an episode of “Sex and The City”. I remember watching this when I was young, and although I couldn’t make it through most of it, I still remember where it was happening.|0
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like barnen in Danish, is a small farming community located in Sweden , and it is a place filled with beautiful scenery . When the book begins , we are treated to a beautiful introduction . The story of the community is set to begin soon , and the author has written a prologue in which he tells us a lot of the history . It is interesting to see a book with a prologue in it , as they are not usually used , but I liked the use of this one .|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is basically a cross between Clueless and The Breakfast Club . It was a good flick . The main character is the leader of a group of popular girls at school and she gets sent to a rehab for a bad eating habit . It gets better as you go on with the story . The guy who plays the lead is good looking . There is no kissing or sex scenes but the story is funny enough to make a grown man blush . Recommended for fans of drama .|0
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and vice versa. The one I'm thinking of was a feature length film where a human played as a bear, and another human played a wolf, and another human played an elephant. I'd like to think it was from Japan. It's been years since I saw it, but I couldn't find the name of the film at this moment so if anyone knows of it, I'd be greatful. I'm thinking of a few movies where animals or monsters are playing a human.|0

His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It is , like the band's other recent releases , one of their most accessible efforts to date . it is also one of their most varied and powerful , in that sense . like their earlier efforts , they have found a way to fuse elements of pop , punk , grunge and heavy metal to make something all their own . they have never sounded better and they never will . after a slow start , the movie gets off to a fast pace as it explores the characters of the band .|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
"`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what some have been saying. . It's a film , but it's not too long , and not too long . .

' Showtime ', a comedy by , directed by , produced by , starring , written by , starring and with as the leading lady, is like a well-oiled piece of machinery running smoothly at full speed on all cylinders for 90 minutes. The main thing you have to keep in mind when you watch this film is that you should take it with a few grains of salt."|0
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1

"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1

What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an epic, but there is plenty of suspense , action , drama and a whole lotta heart , if you'll pardon my pun . You are gonna love this one and you will have the whole family laughing . So go see this and have fun ! This movie is a must see . I have seen most of the Pearl Harbor movies, but my favorite was Pearl Harbor , which was directed by John Ford . I recently watched Pearl Harbour , which is the first of the Pearl Harbor movies I've seen.|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the greatness of his previous films , I think this one is a good film. I have seen this about 9 times in 2 different countries already , and this time I will be watching it from the beginning. Sacha is brilliant in this , the film is funny and full of surprises. I highly recommend you watch Sacha's movies , they all are brilliant . Overall, I wasn't a fan of it at first.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down to the UK and watched it again on the video tape (or whatever it was on then) I bought it off eBay. There's a lot of swearing in this film as well as some other language that probably isn't appropriate for a family site, but overall I'm glad I saw it. If you have an interest in WW2 you should see it, even if you're not a big fan of war films it's just a good watch.|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had many references to the show. Some of the references were to the regular Simpsons characters, including Homer and Lisa. The most well-known is to the episode Homer 's Quitter, but other references are also mentioned. Contents

The most well-known scene in the special is where Bart and Lisa try to open a Christmas present. Homer enters the room and, seeing Bart 's excitement, offers him his own present which he says he won in a poker game."|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , at least in the movies. If you're like most people , you probably saw the trailer and thought you 'd seen this before . In some ways , you 're right. This is the second film from writer/director Mike White . The first was Comedy of the Absurd . In that , he wrote , directed and starred in a feature . This time , he has written , directed , acted in , and co-directed .|0
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Road '' ), a film that remains somewhat under-recognized by both critics and film buffs , is an extremely enjoyable Italian crime drama from 1969 that explores the dark side of society through the lives of a criminal gang that robs, kills, steals, and exploits people. The story is simple: A gang of thieves is operating in the city of Ferrara , Italy, when they cross paths with the police in their attempt to pull off their most successful heist yet.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , you can’t help but cringe when you read the following words, can you? It’s just too horrible a combination of words to be true! In fact, it isn’t all that surprising to find the words ‘Gone with the Wind’ in a film about a film- making giant of the silent era and ‘Casablanca’ (1942) being used as a template for a film about Hollywood.|0
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to make sense - it was never intended to be taken seriously . People are being too hard on this movie. This is supposed to be comedy and not high art. It is intended to be light and silly and very entertaining, not a masterpiece. It is just a movie to enjoy for a few hours. It is just supposed to be fun. That is all there should be from the standpoint of story telling. Now, this movie is a bit more complicated than most comedies.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors make their way to the boat in order to head back to the ship. In the process of doing so, they discover that the ship is not, in fact, a ship but rather a shipwreck and that they have run out of food. With the prospect of starvation looming, Jack realizes that their best option is for the remaining eight people to take a dinghy back to the island, leaving the remaining two stranded on the island.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about corruption . The movie is about a very poor family , one mother and 5 children . They are poor , dirty , without shoes . The father and the eldest son has been jailed for a theft , and the children are used to live off of their mother because of that .

Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back with another dose of that crazy . This is a very long video with some real talk , so be prepared to hear some heavy shit , but I'm pretty sure you're all ready for some of that Slaughter right ? Well let's get to the good part . First thing we got to go over is some random stuff you may have already heard of Slaughter before , or you might have just heard the name , but this is just some stuff you should be aware of .|0
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen before. One day, a friend was talking about a movie with me, and said, ""Yeah, I can't believe how it's rated R."" I was surprised that he'd seen it, and I told him, ""Yeah, it's pretty violent."" Then, we started renting it, and it was a terrible movie. We all thought the same thing: it was rated R for a reason. I think the rating was a mistake."|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
"Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie jumps to the end (which is better I say, because it would be kind of a waste to not know what happened to all the kids in the middle of the movie). I like this movie, even though I've seen it so many times now. I really liked the way the kids all played together in the last scene. A nice ending to a wonderful movie. ""There are some ideas you can’t refute with facts or reason."|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There are a few scenes and lines that are still memorable to me. For example , there is a scene where one character has sex with a dog . There are also a few jokes that are funny in and of itself , like the scene where the main characters are looking for a room in which to have sex and they keep walking around and getting lost . But I would not recommend it because there are some things that will be hard to understand .|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper , who starred in this movie , became a legend after starring in 1970 in BLOOD SPORT . There is a huge difference between the two movies. The acting in the film is great , but the action is not very believable , and there is not even any blood in the film , which in my opinion is a very important element . The film was directed by William Keighley and produced by Walt Disney Pictures . The title was DOA and the music was produced by the Walt Disney studio.|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families behind in South Africa to make their fortunes in America. The journey takes them by boat to Mozambique, then through the jungle to the Atlantic coast. But only two out of the six who leave their wives and children are ever heard from again. It's a brutal story of survival that was inspired by the true story of an ex-wife of the director's uncle who was murdered in South Africa in 2003 and her husband who was also murdered.|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values are all top notch . I would strongly recommend that you see this film . It has some great acting , great plot and is one of the best made TV movies ever made . In fact it has everything that a great movie should have . It is very well done , well presented and has a brilliant cast and a great script . In fact I would not be disappointed if the movie were made into a feature film . That is if the script writers and director have done their jobs properly .|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
