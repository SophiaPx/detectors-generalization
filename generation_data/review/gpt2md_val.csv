This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is one of the better shows you may ever see. I highly recommend this for those who like to watch things that aren't boring, or that don' t necessarily need to be watched all day. There are some really nice moments throughout the show, particularly with Darlene. You know you're going to be in for a treat if you read this review. To begin with, how can anyone enjoy a television series as bad as this?|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
"I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough science fiction in the film for it to be a masterpiece or even an interesting story. There's plenty of cool things in this movie, but some of them don't help us understand or appreciate the plot at all. This is my review of ""Divergent"" #7 . This movie doesn't follow any sort of formula. It's predictable from the first half hour until halfway point, and then suddenly it changes direction."|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends (1971), and A Boy Named Sue (1975), as the titular character. He goes into exile after being kidnapped by a psychotic, murderous killer in order to find his daughter (who has been kidnapped by the monster) and rescue her. This was one of those sequels that would come along at the last minute or two. If you watched it with your eyes closed, it wouldn't seem very original.|0
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of them. The film begins with a young girl looking around at all the horrors she encountered, but after several days she gets lost and finds herself in an abandoned town. There she meets a woman named Lillian (""Lionel""), who explains that her brother has been taken from his family and raised by a ruthless man named Bob (Vincent Bixenshank). It seems he is having some kind of spiritual awakening, but he isn't quite clear on what that means."|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy . It was an absolutely gorgeous performance. I'm looking forward to watching the whole series again and hearing about how it's better than its predecessors. The film did not disappoint. I like this film a lot. I would love to be able to have my own collection of some of his work, but I've heard that they are very expensive so I can't afford it.This one is certainly a worthwhile piece of cinema, both visually and narrative-wise.|0
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
"Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired). In the beginning there is no suspense at all, and most of the scenes are just random shots. But as time passes, you start to suspect there is more going on and it becomes obvious that the plot is actually quite interesting. One of the strangest movies ever made has been made in Australia. One night while watching the television program ""Catch A Murder"" which was broadcast on WA state-owned station Channel 7, one of the guests stated something that shocked her."|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . ""I'm really sorry for what I did to you... but I'll make sure you never have to do anything like this again! I wish I was so kind as not to write about it, since it's such a gross waste of time."" ""This film made me want to quit my job after six weeks, but I can't stop myself from seeing the pathetic attempts they're making to turn this movie into a good film."|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogot√° and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , they have to jump off an overpass. It really did look like a movie - that's what I mean when I say it looked like a movie. You could almost see the makeup and effects, but none of it made sense. The characters were very bland, and the acting was terrible. It wasn't hard to understand why they didn't believe in the story; there was absolutely nothing about this film to suggest it was a good one.|0
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a really bad movie which I like. I watched this flick in the theater because I've seen lots of other movies that are bad, but the only reason I wanted to buy it was for this one. It didn't have anything else going for it, even the title card was lame. All I could think about were those poor people who had to look at the screen and wonder why no one was there. This flick just didn't end well.|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows that it is possible to make a good looking picture. The characters are all well rounded .The story line was quite good and made you feel sorry for the guy who just did what he thought was right because his actions caused the death of someone else. That is my opinion on the whole thing but I don't understand why some people will say otherwise. I am not going to go into too much detail about the plot.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock ¬ñ though as foul-mouthed as usual ¬ñ is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , and they have a habit of beating up the women they find unattractive so that they can gain an advantage against others. This movie is not only bad, but worse than I've seen in years. For starters, the main female leads (Gwyneth Paltrow, Cara Delevingne) are awful. It's not because they're too attractive or smart; it's because they are too obviously immature and stupid to be able to control themselves.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clich√©s about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time, even though I can't make out what's going on. The producers didn't know how to put on a show like they used to do back in the 90's. There are too many things going on in the world today that nobody ever knows about. And now they've added some other elements to it. They need someone to step in and clean up the mess. ""I never thought I would feel this bad about my TV show."""|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it all come to me at once. As an old school hobo with little knowledge of film I was very disinterested in seeing anything involving zombies, vampires, monsters, aliens or even space pirates. So when I watched this movie I didn't care what kind of weird creatures were roaming the streets of London - it was just a waste of money! I think this is one of the best zombie movies I've seen. The first thing you realize is how stupid they are.|0
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. This is a very good movie as well, there were a lot of great moments (i don't think they are even mentioned in the film but I know what i'm saying) that make me glad I was there for it.I will admit that I didn't get all the reactions I expected. At times you really do have to let your guard down. I thought we had gotten past the bad jokes at some point.This is just a bunch of crap.|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some of the worst movies ever made and honestly, there was no question why. When you think about it, what would be better than just being on stage singing a song ? What would be better than watching two girls dance with each other? It didn't take long for me to get the message though ! You see, in my opinion, this movie sucked . The acting was awful and the music was absolutely terrible. I even considered leaving the theater when one of the dancers said she could sing!|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a fan of the show. It's not the best film I can remember, nor the greatest, but it's fun and entertaining enough to remind you that despite its flaws, it has a wonderful cast. The only reason I gave this an eight was because of the movie being so overproduced. To be fair, it also had the worst script ever put out, although the acting could have been even worse. The plot was very vague at times, especially around the death of the hero.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little.I was expecting a big-budget western movie that would take you back to the days when there was an American flag on every street in America. But it just didn't quite make that impression. If anything, some parts were dull and boring, as if the story was already written. The whole thing dragged out for a very long time, which seemed like an appropriate length for such a short film. Oh my goodness!This is what we've all been waiting for!|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I really didn't like her performance. She looked just like an older sister and I thought she was just annoying.I saw the movie a year after it was released, and that's why i can relate to her character. The story is too similar, and the ending makes me feel cheated. As I said about my previous review, this is a very boring movie, which is understandable for anyone who knows what they are talking about.|0
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and actor but there are two things he wasnt. One is that he didnt think of the fact that his movies werent meant to be made into movies. But the other one... well, it doesn't really matter because I just had to stop and watch this crap in order to get my money out.I saw this movie when I was 21 years old back in the mid 90's. I always thought I would love it.|0
"Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he thinks the movie should be made, though.In any event, ""Gravity"" was a flop in theaters. When it came out, an audience of mostly women thought that the film was about something other than love. I first saw Gravity for the first time one day in my 20's. That day, I went to see a Broadway musical called ""Dancer in the Dark."" It had great production values (the lighting was so bright), but the plot was pretty generic."|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going on here. She knows her mother is a big whore and she's so desperate that she needs to have sex with one of her male teachers. She just can't get the words together. But then she gets a phone call from the teacher telling her to come home and watch something. The only problem is that there isn't much to see on that screen. Oh, wait, I meant to write that. This is a movie about an actual student watching porn.|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I thought it was well done. However, all too often movies get overlooked by the general audience and I wanted to see it again. It's hard to argue with my rating of 8/10! The first few scenes are so over-the-top absurd that you can barely believe that they are filmed in real life. This one has a good plot (see the beginning). But eventually the script starts to unravel due to the lack of imagination in any direction.|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile egos that get us in trouble. I found it absolutely hilarious. I was shocked at how many people did not find it funny. I must admit I don't give a damn what people think about movies, especially if they are making fun of someone or something. A movie needs a script, a storyboard, actors to play the part, and an editor to edit the movie... If you can get these things together, then maybe it can be done.|0
"I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of a customer who wanted to see it, I am sorry. This movie has some real bad acting in it that does not make a very good film.There were several times where the lead actor said ""No way!"" while the character was speaking.This movie should have been turned into a horror movie. This movie is nothing special. It's an awful remake of a movie from the 70s. It's boring. There isn't too much action."|0
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA. I am not a fan of that book; it's too good for my taste. I don't like any part of this, though I must say that there is no lack of interesting material. The author does a pretty good job of describing what life was like during this time in America, but I think we really miss out on so many important facts that we rarely hear about them. North and South Book I: This is one of the best books I have ever read!|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time it's a film with no redeeming quality of plot or characters and its just plain unoriginal. I am not sure what you guys are looking for, but if you really want to know how my mind works, go to any one of the websites here: www.naturalsociety.org (this is a site where people like myself can look at nature), www.theobserver.co.za (an Australian website that claims to be ""The World's leading naturalist"" and which includes an article about Australia) or www.skeptoctories.com (another website)."|0
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by a deranged psychopath, she finds herself feeling conflicted and alone in this war between good and evil. First of all, I am amazed that anyone would go to any considerable length to make a movie about murdering their ex-husband. The plot is so convoluted that it makes me question whether anyone would bother writing a script for a movie if they didn't actually commit some truly horrific murders. The first thing you should be aware of when you watch this movie is that there are too many deaths.|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clich√©s andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""√† la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music and an unexpected ending. My first time watching this movie was on the DVD's release. I found it hard to concentrate as I felt like I was getting lost in a world that seemed completely alien. The main problem was that, while at times the visuals were stunning, the film just couldn't hold my attention enough to make me care about any of these characters (though they do get better later).|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing and some great acting, which makes it something that will appeal to everyone.I did not like any of these characters so much, but at least there were some nice people among them. The main story was about a man who falls in love with a beautiful young girl, who ends up taking her on a shopping excursion to buy things from one of his relatives. I didn't care too much or anything for the plot except that it seemed quite entertaining.|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. I didn't get a chance to sit down and watch as much of the movie as I would like but for those who do, this is definitely worth a watch.This is the first time in my life where I'm so disappointed in something that I didn't really want to understand or even care about. The characters are so stupid and unmemorable that they're not even good enough to make me root for them. Wow, just wow.|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be nothing but a bunch of douchebags trying to beat each other up. ""I'm pretty sure he never even saw the show. I'd better not have made any comments that didn't come back to haunt me."" So there we have it. That's one way of putting it. There was nothing funny at all in this short film except for having some fun watching guys try their damnedest to knock each other around, so you can see why they don't like it."|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes ,I am glad i listened to this film as I would not have wanted to see anything else but this one. BEST OF ALL THE SCREEN MOVIE IS THE PERFECT WAY TO TEACH YOU HOW TO LOVE AND BE LOVING IN A WORLD THAT IS FOR BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO OR EXPLAIN IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENS AND IT HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH HUMAN BEINGS. The best movie of all time. So good it has become a cult classic, and is still being seen by adults around the world.|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
"The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being interviewed about his new show, ""Masters of Comedy"". The interviewer tells Carle that while the program is very good, he doesn't think there is much in it that could make him laugh. He adds that one thing he finds amusing is the story of a guy who was once hired to drive a truck full of gas across the Pacific Ocean. One of the first things you notice about this movie is how bad the acting is. That's all it needs to be!"|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe the film takes place in 1947, where people have forgotten how to work and can't trust each other. There is only one survivor, his wife, who manages to convince him to set out with her to find her husband. The entire journey takes about 40 years.The plot revolves around two brothers who are always on the move, searching for lost money and valuables. During their travels they stop in various cities.|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with The Black Stallion (1988). It is a great film and one of those underrated movies from the 1970s that were so good that it didn't matter how long it took them to finish. But in 1992, Van Peebles released this movie on Blu-ray, and all hell broke loose.The plot of the film revolves around two high schoolers who find out that their mother, who is married to an Irishman, is secretly being kept alive by him, because she believes in reincarnation.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , keeps you guessing. But, it's still a really slow film. The pacing takes a long time to sink in for the characters (though they're all decent), the scenes aren't terribly well done, and there's never any emotional payoff.It's definitely not a bad movie, but I can understand why people don't find it appealing or entertaining anymore. This one has some fun with the format.|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Wheel ' by John Lee Hooker . Now, let us look at a film of that period called 'The Lone Ranger' ! This movie was written and directed by Sam Peckinpah. He would eventually become one of the directors of many of the most famous westerns of our time like 'Chinatown', 'The Deer Hunter', 'Casablanca', 'Straw Dogs' and 'Catch-22'. A guy goes to an isolated country to work as a cowboy.|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their best. While some of their scenes can be entertaining, almost none can make for a comedy. This is another example of the bad acting I'm sure every actor out there will have to give it a miss. This isn't a funny piece of work by any stretch of the imagination but that's what makes it enjoyable. We're talking about an ""actors"" movie with actors who were very clearly auditioning for part of this project."|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
"This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to win the Big Brother tournament, and then ends up losing. He says it's because he is ""out of shape"" for his first time on a game show , but he has never actually seen a real Big Brother. I'm not one to criticize anything I see on this site. It's just a few people who are really into politics. So I decided to check out some of the comments (the comments are very well done)."|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in his life. After being dumped as a movie stuntman, he gets sucked into the underworld of New York's crime syndicate and sets off on a journey across the world. The premise of this thriller is simple: a guy wakes up with his wife dead on the couch, and must save the couple from a gang of vicious killers who are after him. Unfortunately for the killer, his ex-wife isn't going to miss her next chance to be murdered, so she needs to stay out of trouble too.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there is a much grittier film that offers a truly haunting glimpse into the lives of two teenage girls in their first year of high school.The story centers around a group of teens and their friend who stumble across a beautiful young girl's corpse on the beach. As soon as they hear about her disappearance, they send for the police to look into the mystery. I really enjoyed the movie, but it took so long. I was hoping for a lot more, however, when it finally opened.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross looking to sell stolen goods. But you have to admit that the plotline just doesn't work and it's too short to keep up with the action scenes. You might be wondering why I haven't seen more of this film yet. Well, after all, if your goal is to make some cash on the side, there's a whole lot you can't do. I did not expect to enjoy this so-called 'classic' film as much as I did.|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in almost every way imaginable, it manages to contain a lot of important and interesting material. I loved this movie. It started off great... I thought maybe there was something special about the writing. But once again, when you see how much effort is put into the story (it takes over 2 hours for me to get through it), it quickly becomes clear that the story has zero interest in making sense. If anything, it makes it even more incomprehensible.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in so many ways, not least the way that it was an homage to a great writer of the late 1960's, Richard Yates. A good movie and I can't help but enjoy the writing. The story is interesting, though I doubt we will have time to find out the real reason for the existence of such creatures or even what causes their actions (if they do ever exist). Some of the actors did a good job, especially David Carradine , although his acting was weak.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines all the characters together as a cohesive team. The story is slow paced and predictable and the characters are given little or no real development until the final quarter of the film. At times it appears as if the writers were trying to create suspense by keeping the main cast from being fully introduced, and this actually worked. I really like this movie. This was supposed to be a thriller. Unfortunately it wasn't.|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement, while trying to save a young girl. But as they try to do their job, one of the cowpokes gets caught in a rock formation and almost dies. One of my all time favorite films, ""Mormon Stories."" It was also one of my most poorly directed films. I loved the first half but when it got into the second half there was not much going for me anymore. I really don't understand how people like this can be considered cultists."|0
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I was disappointed when I read the reviews and thought, Oh yeah, that's a terrible film for a kids movie. In fact I loved the whole premise of it - we all have to discover the meaning of life at some point. I had a brief discussion with my girlfriend about this movie just before bed. She has very little experience with films (even though she knows how they are made) and commented that she had never seen anything like this before.|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
"This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. I had no problems with how the film was shot, which is what makes it so enjoyable. The acting was solid, though not enough to get me out of my chair. My favorite moment happened when they were talking in front of their home and she said 'Hey' and her husband looked at her and said 'What do you say?' Now I know why some people like watching TV shows that don't end. A man says ""Hey!"|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
"The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Artie Lange and a bunch of women trying to save themselves from drowning on a New York City beach - which was the whole theme of the story. What I really enjoyed is how this was done, making it seem like you could sit there for quite a while and not get tired of the scene. This movie was supposed to make me go ""Wait, what?"" After watching it again, I feel that I may have made up my mind: this movie is just plain wrong."|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as ¬ënurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were very cheap and the quality was poor but it was really good! What can I say, this is my favorite horror movie ever made! If you're looking for some truly horrible horror, this is it. The dialogue is so horribly incoherent and ridiculous that I'm not sure if I could keep watching any more. Even though this is a remake of the original, I cannot see anything remotely resembling a coherent plot.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining a reasonable amount of tension. This is not an exciting flick but I found it to be very entertaining in its entirety. I was disappointed with the ending, especially considering how much time had been wasted on the storyline and character development . I really wanted to like this film, but then I came back to it shortly before being able to finish it. I actually saw it again when it went on at 5pm on the DVD release date.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me, but since that time I've been able to appreciate it and enjoy it more than any other film I ever saw on television. There are many interesting characters in this flick, both good and bad, and I think there's a fair amount of truth to them all, but the main thrust of this movie comes down to an extremely stupid story told by two idiots who have little idea what they're talking about. I bought this show because I really wanted to like it.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it was a good movie but after watching it for 30 mins I got sick to my stomach. As far as the plot goes, if you've ever heard of ""The Simpsons"" then you're pretty familiar with all the bad stuff going on. This is a stupid movie. A bunch of losers who live in a fantasy world decide they want to kill each other and go to battle with swords, spears, axes, guns, and lots of magic."|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a single movie made at the time was as good (and better) than this one. The script and music are so bland that it barely makes you care that the characters exist or even that they actually exist (you can tell they're all clones of each other if you watched the trailer). The plot is convoluted enough that you need to go to the movies for some context before getting into it, which isn't too bad.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the wrong place to start your own website ! i am trying to create something new.i want people to know this is real,this is what it looks like when you get in your car.the first thing you see is an advertisement on tv for some sort of business,its very funny,but you can't buy it from a book store. There are lots of good reasons why you should not spend more than 2-3 minutes on a website. The first one is the size of the entire site.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to fully aroused woman and then back to repressed virgin in a moment, I was surprised that this was the first of what would become an annual tradition. The problem was, it was horrible. It wasn't the same as any of the worst films I'd watched during my college years, which was probably the most boring I'd ever been. But, even so, I can't really recommend it.|0
"Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best sums up it all is:
"" ""There was this one scene where a group of friends go out to dinner and are eating at a local diner. The only problem is that none of them have money. What happens when the waitress asks if she could take a tip off, and they say no. She then comes back to the table and offers to take her order, but does not seem to have had any extra money for anything else."|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. If you are looking for a perfect day at the pool or to meet up friends, this would be a perfect day. The beach is pretty good though. The kids were very fun and didn't complain. If you're looking for a place to spend the night it's probably better to come early as there is no electricity. I was really disappointed with this movie. I had already seen all the other awful ones but this one seemed to lack anything unique.|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed it), but alas, I don't have that option. I am completely in love with this film! It is so good and so funny! The acting is great and the writing is really nice! My only problem is that this movie is not for the faint-hearted! After all, it takes place during World War II, and when the Germans were about to invade France, Hitler ordered a complete evacuation of his country.|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of parents to their children. This show was about a small family, who move from one city to another to escape their own troubles. The main problem is the lack of human relationships. A lot of them don't like eachother, and are not always on the same page as each other. This can be annoying. They also have some really bad parenting skills. I wish there were more episodes like this series. It's sad how much has changed in this series since the original airing.|0
"This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching it, I can honestly say this: This is one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I have heard good things about the first movie. But I was worried about the second one. My only reason for being so was that there were actually two episodes in the movie. They did a pretty good job at keeping the plot from going to waste, but the performances weren't up to snuff. I really don't recall much about ""The Man With No Name."""|0
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen in a very long time . The main character has become obsessed with a woman he meets on the street, a woman whose name sounds like it should be Fata Morgana . In order to do what she wants with the person she calls her lover, she tells him all kinds of disgusting and terrible things about her - even telling him she has two daughters. This movie is so bad it deserves its own website.|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
"If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I can't imagine sitting down and watching these movies again. There are some moments that made me laugh, there are some which made me cry, and they really did leave an impact on me. Unfortunately, none of them were truly ""bad"". I watched this movie because I have a lot of friends over at my house who are avid watchers of Star Wars (I am not one of those)."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right! I know.I'm not saying it 's going to kill everyone in America , but that 's what it should do. This is a film with some serious shortcomings, like most of these genre movies are. This one seems to be full of them. The only redeeming feature is that the actors are very believable and convincing for the roles they play. There are other films where the cast is well rounded but the acting was so poor that I couldn 't see any difference.|0
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , a nice cast, and even a cool music theme. The only bad thing about it would be that the acting was terrible. I read all the reviews before I bought this movie. I have seen many of those reviews. Well, you've got to be kidding me if you think i'm going to pass this up for an actual good movie with decent script and decent actors! There's not much else to say. If you'd rather just watch the film, you can do that.|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
"Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen in years. ""You know what's funny? Everybody thinks they know everything. But everybody doesn't know everything. So we just keep coming back."" I can see why a lot of you didn't pick it up but for anyone who did, there are two things to bear in mind. First - it's an utterly forgettable movie with a bad name, a bad cast (it was directed by Rob Reiner), a poor script and lousy acting."|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
"MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to do a short animated movie. And boy, are they good. The writing is on the wall (well almost) for everyone to hate it as soon as its released, but I will say this... if you've ever seen it you will see why. A few months ago I stumbled across a great documentary on the film school's history. Its called ""Hollywood vs. School Life"" and has some truly funny moments."|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's a very well made movie in every aspect. I can't really describe it to you more than that because it is such an unbelievable movie, it makes you want to watch it again. You will wish you saw it sooner rather than later. The characters are quite well done, there are not too many plot holes and there is plenty of time for the story to get started. The movie starts off with a shot of a man lying on the street.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a woman, and what not, this is your movie. As I said earlier in the review I have seen quite a few terrible movies over the years so I was shocked at just how awful this one was. From the beginning it is clear that there has been a lot of poor writing from the writer. The script is very repetitive and lacks creativity. I honestly don't think the actors did much better on this one as the acting wasn't all that bad either.|0
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about it prior to that point. I didn't even remember having seen the original film, much less its sequel. I also don't really know anyone who grew up with a Star Wars Blu-ray...so it was a bit strange to catch this one in the mail. If you are into Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, or the original trilogy then this is definitely for you. After all, there isn't much else out there like this anymore...if any!|0
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it ! I just want a movie that tells the truth of the matter! I am truly sorry that I wasted my time with this film ! One thing is for sure though - it is a terrible movie. The story was totally stupid, the acting was horrendous, the direction was horrible and the acting by the main couple (who I loved) was absolutely awful! It's one of those classic stories where the main characters get on a plane to another part of the world.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of a local crime gang, Hendricks is assigned to catch him. As he attempts to track down and interrogate the group's leader , Hendricks discovers that he may have been framed by someone who knows his name... but doesn't want anyone in trouble with his gang.The film starts out with some great performances from Mpondo and Ejiofor, which lead to one of the most gripping thrillers I have ever seen. In fact, it was nearly unbearable.|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a good story. In the 1980's and 90's television was dominated by movies, dramas and even reality shows. However with the arrival of Reality Shows it has been shown how far we can extend the boundaries of TV to allow comedy and drama to fill in the gaps. I don't think there's anyone who doesn't have some sort of fondness or obsession with King of Queens . I've watched two episodes of the first episode of season 2, and that's it.|0
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of American culture and that of its Nazi counterparts. This makes for some pretty cool imagery, particularly when combined with the movie's plot.It's no secret that US The Movie was extremely popular at the box office back in the summer of '76. I'm sure anyone who watched it knows what a hit it was at the time. But even though it won awards (and critics too) there were so many things wrong with the film that it had to be pulled from the market.|0
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 1998 . It had just been released on video and I didn't realize until a few years later that it is an excellent example of what film critics have said about it. If you want to make fun of bad cinema, this movie could really help you understand why some people seem to have a very hard time getting through it. This film has absolutely no redeeming characteristics. It may not be as bad as its title suggests, but I don't think anyone knows what it's trying to prove.|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
"This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The cast of this version includes John Goodman, Ed Begley, Gary Cooper and Robert Taylor. I have to say the film I saw last night that I had read about, was actually excellent. But as for the title of the movie it made me laugh out loud. It's an ironic title, isn't it? Maybe it was a good parody of ""The Man Without A Home,"" which came out two or three months before this film was produced."|0
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to watch this film. I cannot say how well the rest of the film has done with respect to plot, characters and direction . It's a good movie! Not great as I expected since it was made by David Lynch and his wife in 1979. But hey, there are so many more great shows that he could've made at least if he would have tried harder. I really don't know how much effort he went through in making the movie.|0
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and inspired by the most beautiful people alive, including yourself. If there were one word that could convey this film it would have to be ""awesome"" and if you haven't been watching it yet, here it is: awesomesauce! I'm a diehard sci-fi fan and when I first heard the news that George Lucas was writing a movie called ""Star Wars: Episode 5,"" I had no idea what to expect."|0
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is a pretty cool film. One thing that didn't quite work for me was the special effects, but this movie does an excellent job at adding to those effects.I'm not sure if it's due to the lack of good actors (at least IMDb listed some decent ones) or because there wasn't much time between the release of the first Star Trek movie and the production of the second one, but this was definitely my favorite movie of the year.|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Ren√©e Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fianc√© and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, C√©dric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
"The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me just say that when I first saw it (in college in the mid 90's) I wasn't very good at acting, I just knew what to do. This movie is absolutely awful and I feel sorry for the producers as they would rather make a movie that makes people laugh and enjoy it. ""The Box,"" based on a novel by Charles Schulz, was one of the great horror flicks of the '80's."|0
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not realize that this would have such a negative impact. I think this movie has been overhyped because it was released during the first film, The Big Lebowski. What made this film work was its storyline which took place back in the 1980's. This movie had a great story line with characters who were interesting and different than the previous film. There are also some very cool effects in this movie. It is hard to believe that even in 2000, we still had the idea of using cars for space travel.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort to portray the character and the story but he just can't be bothered to put it together. I don't mind seeing an action-movie star doing his thing, but I have no patience for films that are ""just so bad"". I am surprised that this review was written in January, because I had seen the trailer and immediately thought, ""Holy crap!"" It was a beautiful film, especially the opening credits. However, I wasn't prepared for the movie to go nowhere."|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Both films are absolutely terrible. This movie isn't bad by any means.The acting is pretty good and it's a bit more interesting than I expected. The story doesn't hold your interest too much (unless you like to see violence) and there are a few bits that I couldn't help but laugh at. All in all, I would rate this 1 star. If you like westerns check this one out. I just watched the film.|0
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sexier and more melodious, I have no problem with what happened in this film , just not enough to make me sit through it (it was very slow-paced for its time).I will say that some of the action sequences are pretty decent, there's no way I would want to watch such a gore-fest like this. But you know what? I'm glad they didn't rehash them. I liked The Great Gatsby quite a lot when I was growing up, and still do now.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time, but in truth, I don't even get to see enough of it to decide on what goes on at the end. I would like to see someone write a proper conclusion, but that seems impossible right now! I loved this show when I first watched it. However, since then I've only watched the DVD version and so far have fallen in love with this crappy movie. There really are no funny moments here, there is very little drama, and the entire plot is completely predictable.|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something good! I have no idea if they are in fact the same people or not.I think this is probably the best of the 4 films that they've done. I can easily see myself watching them again, especially if they are an 80's re-make of a TV movie. I would like to give this film 5 stars and say that I found it to be one of the worst movies I ever saw on the internet.|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it or not! As I watched, I couldn't help wondering what exactly was happening in this movie. There was a very short sequence that played out on the screen where an older woman walks into the restaurant with a bottle of beer. She turns and sees two young men sitting outside. They start talking about how nice it is to be served food by somebody who can speak their own language. As they begin to drink, one man says something that got me really excited.|0
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG docu that made me think, ohhh crap, this is something that I really shouldn't have taken to a movie theater at all. I am not going to spend more than 20 words describing what I enjoyed about the film. There are so many things that make it worth the watch. First, the story. I liked the premise of ""The Great American Adventure"". We learn that a man comes up with an ingenious idea and goes through several steps to make it work."|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks ago, when it was finally posted online. Now I am in disbelief that this one has not been made into a film yet, since it would have made perfect sense to do an adaptation of the classic story! It's just terrible! There is such a blatant disregard for what the original script actually represents. Everything from the ending, the characters, the themes, the way the whole film should have been presented all fall flat.|0
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as every one had to be seen. The acting is good as does the script but there are so many problems with this film, you could say it's a failure of art. This film should've been banned from the British film industry, I'm sure of that! One of my favorite movies (and probably the worst). If you have any experience at all working on any kind of storyboard or visual effect, this is the place to start.The movie consists entirely of CGI action sequences.|0
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated. It's funny to think that I would watch something like this when I still knew nothing about the world of video games (I couldn't even say that I had ever really thought about video games at all). This film tells me, ""You must be bored of watching so much of this crap, you should try and see a real movie or something."" What? You're going to find some kind of horror-comedy here, right? Nope."|0
"I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , if you've never had the misfortune of seeing it, then I can only advise you to try it. The opening credits were very cute and i couldn't stop thinking about the beautiful girl who fell in love with a handsome guy that seemed like his age. Hmmm..this movie seems so much like the old ""The Boy Who Could Not Escape"" where the main character gets married to a beautiful woman and she ends up becoming pregnant with his child."|0
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and I remember thinking how funny it was . Then I had to see it again because I wanted to go to Disney World that year. The fact that it was shown as an animated feature made me sit through the entire film. It was actually pretty funny in its own right, but I feel like so many people who have seen it don't really care. I thought this was such a good idea that I rented it on DVD (the original one) with no warning, and watched it two times.|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (at least most of the characters) very much. The ending was well done but I don't see how it was not funny. The music was OK, especially for an 8-bit era. The whole movie is so boring and pointless. In my opinion it's worth less than 2 cents. It's really nothing more than that. Why does any director go to the trouble of making a film like this when all you need to do is get in a good fight?|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most enduring examples of that. However, since his death in 2006 , it has become fashionable among film fans around the world to blame him (or a bunch of other people such as Richard Donner or Robert Redford ) for the success of certain movies. There's been a pretty big debate surrounding this subject lately, mostly focusing on the criticism directed at Steve Martin's The Departed . I think it's important to put some context about the movie before making general statements about it.|0
"This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. If they had shown it as a kid, they probably would have lost a little of the charm and fun. So...what do you get when you mix two genres? Let's put this one in your mouth: An epic romance/comedy centered around an over-protective parent who takes her young child for a ride on a road trip between two rural states. Then she gets caught up in a series of ""accidents"", culminating in one that leaves her severely wounded and scarred by multiple injuries."|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , watching it in the early 90s. The film begins with a man who sees a little girl's face at the window of her house. She doesn't say anything, and suddenly there's a voice over saying something very rude. Then the camera cuts away to reveal an evil figure riding around on two horses, looking for victims. There is no script here, just a shot of one of the horses pointing his gun at some person sitting on the street.|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . In the movie, two friends and I watched 'The Man Who Would Be Queen' from the start. We loved it immediately and then we just stopped watching it for a couple of months. That was the day I decided to stop watching films like this. When I wrote this review today, I knew what I was getting myself into. A remake of The Great Dictator has been on my must list for years now but I wasn't expecting something so awful.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
"The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10/10. This story was so over the top that I couldn 't wait for it to finish! This movie has nothing to do with Buddhism whatsoever. And there are NO Buddhists! It's just some nutty people going off on a bender and then turning around and saying, ""Well, let me tell you about Zen!"" You have no clue what's going on because they never come up with any names. They just start laughing."|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two Sisters'. There are no surprises, and the story isn't overly complicated, at least not for a comedy/drama. In fact, some of the characters act quite childish and even immature. 'Two Sisters' is an interesting drama in many ways. It follows three girls who go on an adventurous journey around the world, trying to find their lost father, only to become ensnared in situations that they can't escape.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren Faust is amazing as a woman. It's good to see a comedy on TV again since it's been a couple of decades since I saw one. It wasn't much different then, and I guess I didn't know what to expect. The only thing I can think of besides the fact that this show has been done in Canada was that the producers decided to do it in the USA after watching an episode of Saturday Night Live.|0
"I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing when I saw something that had been posted to our Facebook page with the tag ""Shallow Grave"". There was a lot of hype surrounding it. After seeing the trailer for the film, I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad you have seen this movie. If there's one thing I wish I could improve on, it's dialogue. I don't think we've gotten enough of it here in the U.S. or around the world."|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn in an excellent role. The most surprising thing I learned about this movie for me was that it might as well be a horror movie. Not only did the film have no story, but it even had not one. You know the kind of stuff that you'll watch to get off the edge? Well, you know exactly what happens when you do that. It's been a long time since we saw a good action movie from any company.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes when I was watching this one, as I wanted to hide. The premise is simple enough: three kids are on a trip to see the Wizard of Oz and they come across a haunted house full of ghosts. The kid who is supposed to clean up at the end of the day has a bad headache and doesn't really want to go anymore. The ghost that haunts him keeps haunting him--even if he never sees her again!|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and son who have been gone for years. His life is in a constant struggle with drugs, alcohol and suicide. As he tries to deal with this new world, he meets his estranged daughter (Lily Collins) and an ex-colleague (Bruce Willis), who help him find something else to live for. This story of two men trying to escape the pain of death is not as easy as it may appear at first glance.|0
"There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio and one of the Carpenters starts to sing ""Wish They Were Gone"". I think that this was intended to be an homage, but the way it plays out is much different. Well, if you've seen the movie and read all the comments then you probably know that I'm always up for a good laugh. That doesn't stop me from being totally serious about some things. It seems that they just couldn't possibly have thought of anything more absurd than this..."|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
Clich√©-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story ¬ñ but don't find anything to go on ¬ñ then perhaps you are looking for something rather interesting, especially if it takes a long time to explain and there are other films out there that try to explain everything. I found nothing of note. The characters were bland and their personalities had none of the life and wit that made this film memorable.It was hard to imagine why someone would want to watch this movie. Even more so considering that many people do not like children's movies.|0
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound impact on my childhood. When I was 14, I spent an evening sitting in my parents' trailer watching this movie and thinking to myself, ""I am not going to see this again until I am 65."" I'm a die-hard fan of American cinema but I couldn't understand why there were only two films I could actually recommend to my kids: 1. The French Connection 2. Bad Moms 3. My Favorite Things 4. All In The Family ."|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost) is given a job at a hardware store where he discovers that there's more to it than meets the eye. In the midst of a battle with his new boss, Foster finds himself caught in a strange situation that turns him upside down and leads him out of the store altogether.The movie has a wonderful script by David Zalewski (whose credits include'' The Sopranos'' and ''Gangster Squad''), but the acting is dreadful; the dialogue is clumsy, uninspired, and lacking in gravitas.|0
"I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and it is very hard to find a good Romanian girl who is beautiful and doesn't need help. I would recommend this to any guy who wants to see another beautiful woman. When I saw the movie, my first thought was: ""this ain't nothing but an adaptation of a classic!"" Then I realised that I wasn't expecting much from the film. A couple of hours later, my second thought was: ""what kind of crap did they put on this movie?"""|0
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing that on here. I'll try to make it funny, but there are many jokes that aren't funny and most of them would be obvious from watching an episode. This is a really awful movie ! It's so stupid that I almost couldn't watch this for hours because of how stupid it was ! The plot was not interesting at all ! The actors were so uninteresting ! You can tell what the writers intended when they came up with characters like Kyle and Trey !|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a couple of days, but will become a classic within months or years. The story has an excellent cast , and the music does its job on every occasion . This is by far the worst horror movie ever made. At first, you can see the funny side of it, but as the film progresses, you begin to notice the very real issues with this movie. When I watch a movie for the first time, I have no idea what is going on.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
"With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's not as cute and funny as it may have otherwise sound, but it's still an interesting concept that has been tried and tested. ""How to Be a Woman"" is certainly not a great story. The main cast of characters falls apart at the seams. We don't get to see what happened to their parents either, and we can't even guess why. I really didn't like this film, but I saw it after reading a bunch of critics' reviews on IMDb."|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . It was easy to get a good grip on this film because there was so many angles going through your mind every time you saw it. There was nothing that looked bad, and everything was really very well composed. I'm really curious what this is all about. Why did they make an underwater adventure? I don't like to think about it, because it seems silly. Maybe it's for the kids who won't know any better (they're adults).|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this must have been a reference to how it will be hard to understand what happens to people after death? What is even more depressing is that the film is not even based on any historical event! I have seen some of these movies before which are very well-researched and entertaining, but this one doesn't go far enough. I would not recommend watching it, but then again, you don't expect anything from a movie like this.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
"Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats ok, the movie is just not good. This is one of those films you see and think ""I can do this better"". It is well-made in every aspect but it does have some bad parts. Let's start at the beginning, the way they filmed the opening. It was very difficult for the director to shoot. There were too many actors (well, there weren't too many) with too much time on the clock."|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
"I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point to watch the story behind it and some of the plot twists. The music in this film is superb, I really like the soundtracks for many films, and this one definitely falls into the ""nice but just not up to the mark"" categories. This is by far my favorite movie of all time. I don't know why people keep complaining about how good this movie sounds or looks. What do you want to hear from me? That the music has no effect?"|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational). But there's a big flaw in that, too. I had been looking forward to watching this for a long time; but unfortunately I got disappointed and gave up on any hope of enjoying it. And when I watched it at my friends house it was just plain weird. The actors seemed completely lost in their own thoughts and the plot almost seemed to be contrivance. The story is ridiculous, the characters make no sense whatsoever and the acting was poor.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another crappy piece of trash. Now, I have seen it all. It is not a very good movie, and it has no plot. But what it lacks in plot it makes up for with poor acting, awful editing, terrible acting, poor editing, terrible acting, poor editing, bad acting, horrible editing, terrible acting, terrible editing...I could go on. This is my personal favorite horror movie of all time.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice little story, but with better acting. That's about it. The first few minutes are good enough, but that is when the film starts to suffer from a bad script. The writing is bad (for lack of a better phrase) and very weak. I've said it before and I'll just say it again -the actors are great! Even though most of the characters are in terrible shape, they still do their best. But at the end, everything falls apart.|0
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful landscapes and lush sound track. But the real reason why I love it most about it, is that it has an absolutely incredible plot . The film takes place a few years before we know how the world actually got to be like it is now, but it isn't really. In fact, many things could have happened during that time period (I won't give away anything), but the main character in this movie never had a chance to make his or her own future.|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying it but i'm not impressed. The story is a mixture of plot twists and coincidences that will make anyone who reads the film go ape crazy. The characters are all bland and dull compared to the rest of what you'll find on the screen, and even the actors who appear are forgettable. If there was ever going to be a movie where two people would get together and fight, it was supposed to be this one.|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqu√© for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. The cartoon takes place during the 1950s, where a man calls up Bugs and asks him about what he has seen on television. Bugs tells him that he ""saw"" a group of people killed and eaten by spiders; it turned out that this was an attack by a spider army called the Spidershark. This book is a must read if you're a Bugs fan! It starts off with a short clip showing the beginning of the show, but quickly dives in to all the great moments."|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
"` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , this however is very different . I mean how can you make such a funny movie when you are going to rape young girls and have sex with boys like that? Well i am not talking about any of the other stupid stuff. ""This movie is disgusting in many ways...it's just another example of what I've seen as a viewer before. They don't know what to do with it. If they did, then they could probably write something decent!"|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by her opinion as it was from her perspective. Well, what is wrong with that? First off, the movie has nothing to do with this story whatsoever . It is a ripoff and is just another cheap exploitation film (or at least one of these) that goes against the good old days of genre entertainment. The characters don't add anything to the plot, the acting doesn't keep you riveted, the plot twists are predictable, and the music is terrible.|0
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply the perfect film. Not only is the score of this movie so beautiful it must be from the 80's or early 90's. The performances here are also quite good (and I am going to say that more than any other film) but there were too many errors in my mind, especially on the guitar player's part. He seems to have lost focus on his notes during some of the songs he played, which made them sound very dull.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most horror movies look bad at best and some of the reviews for this one were so bad they could only be from a 5 star audience. However it was just plain bad as well. Some of the gore was very obvious and the acting was poor. ""A man walks into a small town on Christmas Eve, and finds out that someone has been killing people in his name all year long. This is the tale of John D'Anconia."""|0
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for us ! There is no 'speciality' or 'type' - just a mix of quality. If you are looking for it, then I strongly recommend you to check out the other books by this author. You won't be disappointed ! This is one of my favorite titles in the whole genre. Its story follows a group of friends living on their honeymoon in Australia during the Second World War. During this time period we get lots of beautiful women, including some with big boobs.|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ?'' `` Yes , I am a man but I am also a victim !! I have come to forgive you and I will pay for what you did to me .'' There were lots of women in these scenes. One, whose face was always obscured by makeup, has a big scar on her nose. The most disturbing scene in the movie is with the woman who played the role of Marjorie Vannes. She's so hideous that there was no way anybody could possibly believe that she was human.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the soul. I love that this film was only shown in Spain. The story is truly amazing.The script is excellent and really interesting! The actors are talented. One of our favorite films of 2011 has finally come out. In my opinion, one of the worst films ever produced...and that is saying something considering it took more than a decade to get made. However, with the release of this film, I can not complain at all.|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the next one, but this one didn't come out yet. I was a huge fan of the movies, so watching this miniseries just gave me all kinds of feelings of disappointment.I know what you mean, but seriously, there is nothing at all funny about this movie. To sum it up, I can only conclude it was a lousy attempt at acting. Wow, this is one of my favorite video games of ALL TIME!|0
"Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in the middle of the movie where the police chief talks to the actor and he says : ""There's nothing to talk about. We know you don't have a clue, but we've got some ideas on how to get rid of you"". My wife was very excited when i read that the film was going to make an impression on me. When i went to rent it she said it sounded like a good movie."|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love this show is it is such a fun watch. I know there is a lot of bad acting in the first season but the writing was very good when it came to developing characters and the plot lines. The main character, Rory (played by Lauren Graham), is intelligent and funny. However, one thing about Rory is that she doesn't really care who she loves, she just goes along with everything else. She does not care if you believe her or not as long as you do.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
"Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to take down his own brother-in-law and wife. However, things don't work out as planned when two rival bidders join up with their rivals to get rid of Pando. So it's nice to see a sequel this good. In fact, for the most part, there's one redeeming thing about this film. There was a certain level of continuity between ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Night of the Living Death"" (for example), but it wasn't as clear cut."|0
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen a few others ! and for the price it is very good .... you will also find that they use only the most cheap and low quality equipment !! So, my wife called me up one morning and asked me if I could watch this. She said her daughter wanted to see it, so I figured I would have to see it.The thing about this anime is what happens when you let it ride all over your little mind...|0
"If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What makes it bad is that it was made in 1978, when he was already famous. This movie had more potential to attract the audience, but for whatever reason it failed to do so. It has no redeeming qualities, and if you have not watched it recently, you may want to go back as soon as possible. The music is decent at times, and the acting is good overall, but it just doesn't live up to what I expected out of an ""oldies"" remake."|0
"I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way as this. While the movie is actually pretty boring, there are some really great lines that I could have used in the film. It gets kind of tiresome after about 5 minutes or so. In fact it was starting to get rather irritating. One of my absolute favorite films of the 1980's. The original ""Rambo"" has been out for three decades but this latest incarnation is far more faithful to the original than previous generations."|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that this is one of those rare films that deserves to be seen as such. It is well made and beautifully shot . It took me many months to realise this movie was not going to get a sequel. However I finally realised that it would never get made. And because of that I have to admit that I am quite disappointed at the result. The first two sequels are totally overrated. In fact I did not see them in all they were advertised.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (one of the writers) giving a great talk. It was all well written and the music was nice, but I thought that it didn't do justice to the story. I have read several reviews of this production saying that there are things wrong with some of the performances. First off, most of the dialogue was too slow for the camera to keep up with the pace of the storyline. The director tried to make them sound like we were playing a game rather than a real life scene.|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts as though he are a good actor with great acting abilities. I think this is the worst film I have ever seen on TV. In fact I am quite certain that anyone who watched this film today, would be extremely disappointed. The story is so lame that the characters and their lives are so devoid of life that you can just sit down and watch it. The actors are very bad and don't seem to know how to properly act.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three hundred Indians, murdered an entire village, and taken thousands of children hostage. This movie is the worst movie that I have seen in quite some time. The plot is so convoluted that you just can't get through it. There are so many coincidences that could have led to all these different scenes happening at exactly the same times, but because of this, you end up wondering whether the director was watching the TV version of the movie instead of the movie or vice versa.|0
The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Boat''. I went with my girlfriend and we rode along the river bank for 4 hrs. We made it to the bottom and got out of the boat without anyone noticing us because we were just so far down the river. When I was halfway up, she stopped at the mouth of the gorge and told me that if I could get down, I'd see her. I saw this video on a local TV channel, which showed a group of hippies driving their bikes through the rock.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should put the DVD out and let people enjoy it , even though many of them like it. If you were to sit down one morning with a cup of hot coffee in hand, you'd be forgiven for thinking that you were sitting in an art museum. You would be wrong. But then, you've probably been up all night watching documentaries about dinosaurs, so maybe that was what you were expecting.The director, David Lynch, doesn't pull any punches.|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this album isn't up to par, however. This album is pretty bad, but there was something good in it. I'm not a fan of rock bands, so I wasn't going to have too much faith in ""I Got a Dream"" when I saw that this was based around a story of one of them being killed at the end of the previous film. But you know what, let's just say it didn't feel like an honest depiction of how these guys were living."|0
"This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theatre. But then, that's what happens when you miss out on a movie because it isn't widely known (or even talked about by the filmmakers) until it hits stores. The reason I don't care for this movie is because it tries so hard to do something different than any of the others. This movie is not ""alternative"" at all--it has nothing to do with anything but itself. It is just a bunch of kids playing a video game."|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting emotions from the audience. This film is absolutely brilliant and should be seen, not just as a film for kids, but if your age group is anything like me, this could be a must see! I highly recommend you to check it out! What a disappointment! What a shame that the DVD/Blu-ray released on Christmas Day didn't include at least two special features which would have made my Christmas list even worse. First of all: The voice acting.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
"Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . There are some pretty bad actors here. First, there is Gary Oldman , in his prime he was a big star when he appeared with Tom Hanks . He was probably one of the best known actors of the decade but I don't care about how much people like him. He just looks old and pathetic. And the rest of the cast has good looks. But what can you say? There is no character who makes you think ""this person is real."""|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest, but instead I was struck by how utterly disheartening it was. The characters who were supposed to be good had absolutely no redeeming quality whatsoever. The entire plot involved a bunch of people trying to make sense of the universe after all the alien abductions are over. This film may look like something that you might have seen somewhere else on the cable channel, but I can't imagine anyone watching this movie considering it a serious contender in the horror genre.|0
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some time in 2006, I would've wondered how they weren't all trying to get away with murder as well. This is possibly the worst movie that was made in 2001. It basically has two things going on. One is that the main character is a drug dealer and he's constantly getting caught. He needs help from a lady who can kill him if he breaks his rules, but she doesn't really care one way or the other.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress and she can do the movie very well. I don't know how this movie would be able to win it's Best Picture accolade if it didn't look like something out of the Twilight Zone! There's a lot of action in this movie, but none of it is really effective or interesting. I watched this with my kids and thought it was fine for two days. They were also watching the movie on their TV, so they could enjoy it just as much!|0
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis. The only good thing I've done with this novel is that it's extremely hard to follow so you don't always get the whole story or what is going on around you. But other than that the story just feels like a long boring movie, not worth watching again. I am sorry but this was a horrible book! Not only do the characters have no redeeming qualities, the plot never comes close to satisfying.|0
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air again ? I know that it is an original story but why am i wasting my money? the only reason was because of the bad acting by the director in the film. This movie just wasn't funny enough. First of all you are a liar, you should not watch this film. It's a remake of a famous movie and no one has been able to get a hold of its original script or director as he left the production in 1960s.|0
"I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more honestly than many TV shows out there and it did so in a good way that I have always been a fan of 's drama. For the longest time I was trying to follow the lead of my sister-in-law, who came home early from her trip to see an old Western movie. She decided that she wanted to play some cowboy, but she also didn't want to be called ""that woman"", which obviously wasn't in the mood to go on a hunt."|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than the others. It's just not as bad as some films you might expect to see. The characters are funny, and even if this isn't the case, it's still an entertaining viewing experience for those of us that enjoy scary movies. I've been a huge fan of Dredd since my early childhood and have always felt that he was one of my favourite films. However, there was no way I would ever get around to watching this dreadful piece of scumf*cking filth.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd love to sit back, have a cup of tea and ponder the reasons why this film went so wrong.It's hard to pick out a few things that make the movie different. First, the music is not as good as it could be in any other genre. It's quite loud and obnoxious. Secondly, there are some problems with the acting. In fact, my favourite thing about the film (for me) was the opening credits which were more than adequate.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone recommend it to you ? I have to say that I was quite disappointed when I saw this movie, I had never heard of it before (I read a review in a newspaper). It wasn't until I looked at the box office receipts that I understood why people didn't like it. This film has such a dark tone and it feels as if no one really got out of it (in the words of the reviewer).|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but this movie is just plain wrong from beginning to end. It should have been a good thriller with believable characters who can survive on their own. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because of that. I'm not entirely sure whether this is meant to be humorous or for serious, and I think the latter is probably the best choice. There's a whole lot of stuff going on in this movie that makes it almost comical.|0
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series ever. I'm a fan of everything the movie has to offer because it's one hell of a show and there are always some new episodes on DVD every couple of years as well. I am completely in agreement with you. For the most part, I liked the first episode, which wasn't that bad (just a little too repetitive). However, the second half of the show was pretty bland.|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have seen on IMDb seem to take this as a joke. I know that IMDb is just one of many film reviewers and there must be thousands or even millions of other reviewers out there who would find this ""funny"", but what the hell did I ever do? I watched this movie in the theaters and couldn't believe my eyes. I honestly can't understand how people could put this movie into such a dark, disgusting, offensive light."|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . What a waste of time it was and why did they bother to even call it such? You get the point. If you are not an expert on French people, then go read some books. You don't need subtitles. I'm sorry for saying it out loud because I am sure that many people who can't speak English will be shocked by this movie. The dialogue is too clunky and incomprehensible. The characterisation is also bad.|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if the romance is entertaining enough to keep you invested. It didn't seem to be in either category. This movie seems like it would have made a good romantic comedy, so it wasn't really much of a shock that it failed to deliver on all those expectations.I thought the character was okay at first but she became boring after only one scene where she seemed to be trying to catch the eye of a handsome boy.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV show about a bunch of bums trying to get back together. The first few minutes or so are pretty good . But as soon as you start seeing these bad actors try and do their best, the movie just doesn't get much better. First off, there was a lot of plot in this movie that made me stop and take notice. First, it featured a number of non-action scenes involving cars, trucks and bikes.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how Colombia has changed since its independence in 1962. At first, we meet the usual old guys and get a good taste of what it must've been like to live as a woman in that part of Latin America. But then I was taken aback.The film opens with a small group of men playing golf on the island of M√°laga. They are led by one man, who decides to walk his dog along the beach.|0
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains ¬ñ you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one ¬ñ both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
"I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music people, I was very interested in watching this flick. There was only one problem, it looked like there was no CGI at all. The soundtrack was pretty good but i didn't find anything worth watching. This movie does have some merit, and it's just that it's not a ""movie."" This is a piece of art made by a talented director whose talent was wasted on this film."|0
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could not do an interview about it. If the movie had been made, I don't understand how it would have been so funny . The only thing that was amusing was that the characters were completely off-base. There was no way for me to figure out what they were supposed to be saying in the movie. Most of their lines did not even make sense at all. This is a must see movie! It has one of the funniest dialogues in history and a fantastic acting team.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fianc√©e. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai was forced into a convent where she stayed from 13-19 years old after her parents split up, then had to live at home for a couple of years while her father returned to Spain. The first three seasons were awful, so you could forgive it's faults. The fourth season has all the fun, however, except for the final two episodes. I don't remember the first episode or how I found myself hooked by it.|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired and I would have liked to see more, this may be a better than average movie overall. The writing itself is weak, the acting is bad, the plot is not well thought out, etc., etc. All these issues add up to make Conrack just another generic action flick with no story behind it. Don't waste your money on this crap. (Curtis ""Buster"" Conrack)
When you've got the biggest budget of all time, why do you waste it on such a lousy film?"|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to sleep that night and woke up about an hour after the end of the movie, with tears streaming down my face. That was probably one of the saddest things I ever saw in my life. Well, this is a story you don't usually hear anymore. And while some of you may have heard of it, let me tell you: The film is completely un-sourced, never even mentioned as a fact.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a woman feel insecure about their manliness (not that I'm saying it doesn't exist), I was very disappointed. This is not exactly the type of film you'd expect to see directed by David Fincher, so I was surprised at how much I wanted to believe that he was trying something different. I've never been a movie fan but this seemed like such an interesting movie. It looks promising; the script seems to be engaging and intriguing.|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one star and only because this movie is so badly paced and poorly shot. The actors are generally very good at acting but none of them do anything really special. The plot line is so vague that you could follow it if you just read it. You'd be surprised how many times you need to sit through it just to understand all the nonsense. I would never recommend this movie, even if you were a fan of King of Queens , despite its low overall rating.|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film has its charms but it fails in so many areas that it's hard to justify watching it. A lot of the humor came from what seemed like a simple joke at the end of an evening when I thought I might be about to make a joke. But then my wife came up with the best idea for how to take this seriously. This movie had no good ideas whatsoever and it made me want to laugh so much I could barely control myself.I just laughed so hard!|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody knows him, but he made an indelible impact on me in the 80's, so I guess it was a treat to finally have him in a book. This book is as bad as it looks, just terrible. It's not exactly easy to find out anything about Mr. Cukor from television, but now that you've seen this film series, you can probably figure out everything about him from your own childhood.|0
"In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me thinks that this film will never be released on videotape. There's no dialogue whatsoever and the picture lacks subtlety (which it seems to be lacking from most movies). If you're going to write a story about an escaped slave in Louisiana, why not start with him talking? There are a few good reasons I didn't enjoy this movie. To start, I had just finished watching ""Black Snake Moan"" and I found it quite funny and amusing at the same time."|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films, I still can't shake the feeling that it would be better if it had been made in this country. It is such a silly movie - there isn't enough humour in the plot or dialogue. In many respects it has a dull feel about it. For me it just wasn't that great and was actually more of a disappointment than anything else on this list.It was released theatrically in the late 70s but hasn't seen a film adaptation since.|0
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous film score composer, Richard Meehan. He was about 18 at the start of the film. I have no idea why he went to such lengths to make friends with a child. It seems that this is another example of an artist turning a child into a commodity. The kid's face is so badly scrunched and craggy that it resembles a cross between a cartoon and a cartoon character. It was a good movie!|0
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either so good or so awful. This movie is a complete waste of money compared to other comedies in the genre that I see every day. A lot of people are disappointed with this movie and I agree but I guess there has to be some type of reward when one gets a really bad comedy like this.I don't know if I can call this a bad comedy but I will try to tell you what a stupid movie it was from start to finish.|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute family film and has some of the funniest songs on the soundtrack. It is not my favourite but that's about it. Wish I could see this movie every weekend because it looks really beautiful and the acting is great. Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to see at times. I was hoping there would be more than one star in the cast but no, there are only 6. I've heard many comments from other people saying they wish they could see it.|0
"I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is out of its house when it's dark and there's no light in the room. No, if you really want to get down to just what makes this movie so funny, simply ask yourself a few questions:
1. Where were all the jokes made? 3. Why did they have to be jokes? 4. Why would anyone need to laugh at something so stupid? 5. If you didn't see the movie before, how can you watch it now without feeling like you should be crying?"|0
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""murder mystery"". This genre would become very popular in the 1970's and 1980's. Usually it would focus on a single murder/murder case or series of murders etc. The author would attempt to solve each individual case by coming up with a plausible theory which would then be proven true (or false), so there was more of a chance that the person actually did commit the crime, rather than simply trying to get their way."|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 80's (I didn't know it had a title until later). Now, however, I don't know much about this movie other than its plot. I found this movie really boring to me. Not just the plot, but the movie itself. The characters were not interesting at all and it seemed that everyone in this movie was just there to entertain the audience. This film is just so over-acted and forced for the sake of what they are trying to pull off.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years. So this is a very important story to keep your eye on if you are one of those guys who doesn't believe everything that happens in movies. First off let me say that I don't really like 'fantasy' movies at all. It's so bad they suck, it's so dumb it has no redeeming qualities and the script is completely stupid. This movie wasn't even bad; there was nothing about this movie that made me want to get up and leave.|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure if he should shoot him, as he can't understand his actions. He decides to kill him in a fit of jealousy and revenge, but will it actually work? This is another one of Elmer's greatest works - I have read it several times now and never thought it was going to disappoint. The only way this movie would ever fail is if it hadn't already succeeded (or failed badly).|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time, without a lot of depth or understanding as to why any of those people are stuck there. As a child of the 1960s, I was always curious about how the movies were done and what was happening, and I still do that today. The main character is a beautiful girl (she's actually my favorite of all the female characters) who is kidnapped by an angry gang of men. She's forced to perform sex acts in exchange for money.|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen did not quite know what to think. But then again, we have no idea what to think when a movie is based on such a traumatic event for so long. This film has everything you could want in a horror movie: creepy atmosphere, creepy locations, terrible music, disturbing stories and an awful ending. You will not believe it if you saw it.I cannot even imagine how much more horrible this film could have been if all those involved were less intelligent!|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
"This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's. A group of soldiers are sent into battle to save an American who's been taken prisoner by the Vietcong. As the soldiers move towards the enemy, one soldier is shot and killed. I can't believe that this film got made back then. I remember when I was younger, a bunch of us were excited for ""the west"", but it took me quite a while to get around to really watching it."|0
"Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it for example on youtube
A very bad movie with a horrible screenplay by David Gordon Green and a stupid acting team. You can not even tell what's going on at all because of the script that was written by one of the worst actors I have ever seen in my life, Joe Keatinge!!! He has zero acting experience and he takes himself too seriously. There were so many things wrong with this movie! I watched it two nights ago and it was a complete disaster!"|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor (Ralph Fiennes) who goes crazy after his family's car breaks down, and ends up being possessed by the Devil. How I'm Gonna Get By : One of my favorite films ever, and yet in spite of its flaws it remains a great film, so I went for it as soon as I found this one online. It takes place in 1960s San Francisco, but the only characters I cared about at that point were Jerry Seinfeld and Tom Cruise.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just a bunch of old stuff from the 1940s. Anyway, the story is pretty good as you think it would be and the movie doesn't really give too much of a clue what's coming next. I had no idea where to start with this movie. I watched it when it was on television at a friend's birthday party and it brought tears to my eyes. The reason why I thought this movie was bad was because it was boring.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It has to be seen before you can judge it for yourself. In fact, I'm surprised that it still gets a second viewing every ten years or so. When i first saw this movie I did not understand what the fuss was about, because there were so many inaccuracies in it but after watching it my mind just started making logical and reasonable explanations. For example one of the main characters says she's going to go to hell, why would she do that when she could stay with her mother?|0
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The story involves an Indian chief living in rural California who has the opportunity to acquire a new buffalo, but decides to use that as a human sacrifice. A wonderful piece of art. I don't normally post reviews, but this one is absolutely fantastic. I can't explain how it feels to me to watch these movies over and over again for hours. They just seem to be about every genre you could imagine, from comedy to horror to epic fantasy to science fiction.|0
"This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , John, Phil and Bill were in fine form throughout the entire show as well. This show was just too good to put down. It would've been nice if they had gone into a little bit more depth about what went down on this night. I'm glad that there's a new album. But you know what? I'll skip the new album and listen to the actual version of it for a while. ""I'm sorry, I can't find your website!"|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've seen. And for someone so passionate about the show, I couldn't blame him for being annoyed that this was not the case. As a child growing up in the 1970's, I remember having an interest in science fiction and comic books . I still remember reading all manner of books about alien abductions and aliens living among humans (in particular those by Jack London ) and then watching The Twilight Zone or Deep Throat movies on my favorite VCR.|0
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am going to give you my reasons for liking it but firstly, because I had just come back from the UK where I had done research for a book about Irish people during WW2 . I can tell you that there were some great performances throughout and that the cast is very varied. However, the writing style of this film seemed to suggest that there was little effort being made to inform the audience of any of the major events occurring in Ireland during this period .|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. While the plot is a little clunker and the characters don't have any depth, the production values are very good for a low budget action/drama thriller film. In terms of acting quality, it's as good as you're going to see in a Hollywood blockbuster. You can really tell that they just wanted to get some quick cash and not try to create a lasting legacy. This was one of those films where someone at Universal thought: ""Well, at least there'll be something left."""|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
"During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the invading Northern army led by Major J.B. MORGAN. Although General SULLIVAN has made peace with the North, he still holds grudges over what he calls an ""incontrovertible treason"" committed during the Civil War. As the battle rages on across the countryside, Spanky and his troops are forced to flee once again. Only this time, as they make their way through the dense forest, they find that they've become a target of the Confederate Army."|0
"I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the bad acting. It is true what they say, all of the actors were great in this movie but none of them were memorable. I had to take off 2 stars from this review only because I could not see why anyone would feel comfortable giving this movie one star. I've been a lifelong fan of the X-Men (the first comic books) and Marvel films. I'm also a big fan of the ""Deadpool"" movie franchise and the ""Thor"" movie franchise."|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe the movie should have made up a plot or two. But in any case, after seeing this movie, I don't know how to describe my feelings for it. I watched it for the first time with one of my best friends who recently graduated high school. After that, we just couldn't get into it. Why? Because it wasn't funny. What a disappointment. I've been a fan of the show since the beginning and was looking forward to finally getting to see it again.|0
"'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The characters are pathetic, there is no chemistry whatsoever between the two leads, and the script itself is riddled with errors. There is a plot device here or there that will work at least until you discover how to actually watch the film. This film is not without its strengths, but one has to ask themselves ""How bad could this movie be?"" After watching it for about an hour and a half, I am convinced that I had wasted my time."|0
"This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and it makes you want to cry even more. I've never heard of ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"", but I think I've seen it somewhere, maybe on some cable channel. A couple of other people did the same , so it could be true. This one's not bad either...not bad at all. But let's look at the trailer first. What does that have to do with anything? Are we really seeing a new story?"|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
"I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the past years so I figured they would enjoy this as well but what a disappointment!! I watched this in the late 70's because I love to read. I don't understand why anyone should watch this movie except people who can't read (like myself). Not only that, the main character spends all night talking about his plans of how he will ""make war on America"" and ""take out"" the entire government by using nuclear weapons."|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does not give an objective account of events. It does not tell you why they are happening. I can't say this was a pleasant experience, but I had a fairly good time with the movie. After watching the first two parts (which I will discuss later) we were given the chance to have a look back on what was going on behind the scenes. The movie began innocently enough: We saw some people playing chess while a man appeared from his window and said something incomprehensible.|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. I do wish there would have been some more action sequences.The writing was on the wall of being terrible as they say in the business. However, I found myself smiling just thinking about something that I can't see. I think it would have made for a pretty funny flick, but couldn't bring myself to buy it. One of my favorite documentaries ever! There's a scene that shows a woman who has her legs broken walking into a supermarket wearing only a dress and an orange tshirt.|0
"Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's because the American people think that the only thing they should care about is their jobs, as if it makes them any more patriotic. In fact, this is exactly what has caused so much misery in this country."" The ""American people"" didn't even bother to look for an alternative candidate who was far more pro-war than Romney. Why are the American people now so enamored with a candidate who never served in the army or even had anything remotely military experience?"|0
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband and child was in bed. 'What did we ever do to him that would make him think I was his mistress?' she wonders. 'The Devil's Knot'' is not a great story. You have no idea, except you can't care about anyone or anything. There are so many things that could have been interesting but didn't. The main character is pretty dull (even for the low budget film) and has no reason to be engaging.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
"I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come close to doing it justice so if you haven't seen the movie, please find it and stop watching. I still don't know where the money went, nor who or what they even thought they were making in it. The script has some really awful lines which didn't play with me at all. If you are a fan of ""Babes in the Dark"" and want more than that, go out and pick up this movie."|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures are stunning! If it could have been made anywhere else...it would have been wonderful. But when it was made, it really felt like the producers were making up a story for a TV movie. I don't know about you, but I'd prefer if people didn't watch movies they're excited about (i.e. an old school sci-fi thriller).This isn't one of my favourite films, because there is something so flat and boring about it that it's hard to care.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , they did manage to find some good laughs throughout, but it was too much of a departure for me to go into full detail.I loved every second of this show except one. I didn't know how it ended, nor did I care because the ending just made it seem that the main plot was over. I was so happy watching this show! The acting was great, and there was a lot of interesting dialogue. The cast was amazingly well done.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . In my opinion they missed the boat a bit.I am a fan of these films . I would never have bought this movie if it was not for the fact that I wanted to see what happens with the ""dogmas"" in the future. This has little to nothing to do with the original Dogma story, and there is absolutely no reason why the storyline should continue. If you don't think this is a bad film, just wait till you go to your local theater and watch it."|0
"Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and the rest to make for a film that is, in retrospect, far from ""good"". The plot involves a former British spy who comes to the US to work for the CIA, eventually landing a job on a secret government project, only to have his life changed when he ends up being turned over to the Russians.It has its flaws, but even if these weren't the point of the film, I can see how it would be a decent thriller."|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait for local channels and TV channels that are on the PBS channel. I love it! I bought this DVD because my brother was going to buy the original ""American Psycho"" (which came out in the early 90s). I thought the film was interesting and scary, and would give it a try. Not so much. The plot didn't add anything new to the story--the whole thing was predictable."|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is dead of a heroin overdose. And the mother has to raise her daughter alone, without being loved by other adults.The first two episodes of this season were fantastic. There are some good scenes with Lorelai and Rory that made it all worth watching. But in the third episode, we really felt like we could have gone on for hours. We're talking about three or four decent episodes here. I've just found out my wife's favorite movie is Gone with the Wind.|0
"Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and was absolutely hooked by the premise. However, it doesn't do much at all to justify the name ""Cinderella"". It has far worse effects than an actual fairy tale. I was in my mid-thirties when I first saw this movie. To be completely fair, it isn't for everyone. But if you are looking for a fun night's entertainment on one of those lonely nights out with your buddies, then this might be a good choice."|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the cast (and the director) are utterly incoherent. They know that the whole idea is stupid, they want to kill someone and then laugh as they walk away. Then there's the plot. There's nothing going on in this thing, except the fact that it's totally unnecessary. So if you like comedies, you must have an opinion on this comedy. If you don't, you must be some kind of fool! It's got nothing to do with reality at all.|0
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' - this time she went to visit her father for Christmas. He had died two days before, and he left her at his place with a big bag of sweets. It seems as though there is a huge gap between movies where they make money (i.e. comedies) and movies where they can't. I mean, we all know that Disney made some terrible movies like The Jungle Book , so what else do they need? They don't need movie-makers who actually have skills.|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life I'm really looking forward to it, as I thought it would be some kind of bad thing (the first one was The Man Who Fell to Earth ) when it came out. But anyway - let's take a quick look back at those few episodes that made me smile :-). I saw this film while watching a Finnish TV show. Although it didn't really fit with what we know about Finland, it certainly gave me the impression that they were doing good work.|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started in 1994 and by 2001, we had seen two sequels (including one featuring the original) and yet, it wasn't until the movie's fourth entry that it was finally picked up for theatrical release in the US. I would say it was a flop for American audiences, especially considering how successful the franchise was at Europe.The plot revolves around a woman named Jill who is taken in by an Irish couple and raised as their adopted daughter.|0
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me. But I cannot wait to see when they start shooting with this new cast, as I can only hope they will be able to complete all of their characters. First of all the acting was good but that didn t make up for the horrible plot (which is actually very well paced) and the bad script which could not be adapted into a coherent story (i.e., the movie does not go anywhere in the end).|0
"Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't have a good plot line at all. The best I ever saw in a western was ""Reno, Nevada"". This is a great movie and could be a great series but its not really worth my time or effort. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that it has a lot of guns so you could probably make an interesting story out of it. What about the fact that most of the guns are fake (I don't know where they came up with this idea) ?"|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that gets a little sickening. A bunch of kids in their school's history book are suddenly thrown together, with no explanation or explanation at all. From the beginning, they're going to be a team. They know each other by heart, and when they get on the same team, they fight for each other! And...what happens next? It really isn't what it looks like. The only real redeeming quality about this film is the script.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the clich√© cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 24, I couldn't stop seeing it ! It has a story about an ordinary teenager who goes out with his friends to play basketball in a city that doesn't have much of a basketball culture. After a few months, they find themselves living with their new neighbors (who are also from the same city), after all there is no chance of them staying together.This movie made me realize why I'm not too thrilled with the movies on this site so far!|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a whole side of her and it made me laugh the whole time. I always felt sorry for her. It was so bad when she lost her eyesight. First of all I must say that i really wanted to love this movie but i think i can't be happy about this movie. It was so bad, it was so boring. You know why i hate this movies, they do not make you feel what i am going through, because i can tell how bad it is coming from the plot.|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford's production staff did a lot of wonderful stuff that no one will ever see. It is easy for me to criticize this film, because there are far too many elements that I find to be disappointing. However, since I've already written a fair share of my opinion, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. For starters, I won't waste any time and effort here, as I don't even want to write another negative review.|0
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass√© way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
"A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school championship game where she is given the title of ""Won't You Please Forget Me"". She is cast in the role because her parents are going to be away for two weeks (a long time after the movie was made) but it's really not that complicated. First off I want to preface this post with a warning: I'm a HUGE fan of this movie. I watched it as early as I could and have seen it several times."|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, even if you had to make it all up on the spot, I can't see how this film isn't an absolutely amazing masterpiece. This film has not disappointed at all. Its premise seems simple enough, but the acting, editing, directing, script and cinematography are more than beyond belief. Even without spoiling anything, you could feel every moment as if you were watching another film made by a professional.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of on DVD that doesn't have an IMDb page, but for whatever reason they forgot to update it there. The kicker is absolutely stupid. First of all, why would anyone buy this movie? I didn't see anything at all good about this movie so I'm going to be very honest with you...I thought it was a crap flick. It had no redeeming qualities in either plot or acting. So I gave it one star instead of two.|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface level. The movie takes place in 1930s New York (or even early 1950s New Orleans, which was more realistic and less like a war zone) and is mainly set during World War II. It is one of the few WWII films not filmed with actual military vehicles on the sets, so it doesn't seem realistic at all. I really want to like this movie. After watching the trailers and talking about how great it was coming into this movie, I was quite excited when it came out.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of this book. I would have given a five-star rating if I were able to understand why it was even recommended in the first place. It is hard to write anything negative about a book when there are two or more great reviews of it. I am not one of those critics who don't give a second thought to the writing, plot or characterization of the books. Unfortunately, this review really isn't going to do much for me, either.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant and repetitive violence. The first two minutes were pretty funny, mainly because we get a glimpse at what the movie was going for, but after that, it kind of starts to look boring. There was little suspense, no suspense. The story is about a boy who wants to go to war with the Soviets in Afghanistan. His parents are very concerned about him and want to find something to help him make his plan work.|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , but not a great film). But the script was bad. I watched this movie for about 90 mins and my first thought was, wow. How stupid is this movie? Do I know what they're talking about? They didn't even bother with any plot, it just seemed random. And that's the problem with films. There isn't really much plot to begin with, no action, nothing. All you care about is trying to keep yourself entertained at the same time.|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally acted as if nothing happened at all .The film is still the same. There is a very brief but important scene in which the main character is trying to explain why they are being attacked. He does this in order to try and make them understand how bad it is for the humans to kill each other. However, he ends up making things worse when he tells them that there were two people inside the room killing each other.|0
"My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually. If you like a story with strong action, this movie will do for you. I had no problem with watching ""The Mummy,"" but in all honesty I couldn't believe how much my parents hated it. I didn't even see the opening credits on TV, or at least I waited till the last second of the film before watching them. There were times when I was so overcome by terror and fear that I kept my eye on the camera to get a better look at it."|0
"Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead-in song 'I Feel It Coming' where he sings: ""If you're going to see me

I'll have to wait and see how far I'll go till I've gotten it right""

And this is his reply after being told about that track by Steve McQueen: ""Yes, I thought I'd heard it all! And I wasn't wrong. I'm so glad it made it in!"""|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because i was very impressed by how many shows are being produced here. The cast is great, there's lots of laughs in the beginning, but eventually the comedy comes to a head. There is also a tendency for certain characters to get snarkier and not quite funny. I found it amusing to watch every episode with no clue as to who the punch line or joke was. I didn't care that it wasn't funny; if this were a sitcom, you'd expect it to come off as cliche.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much gore in fact). If you don't like gore, then this isn't for you. The only thing that I was really worried about going into this film was how bad it would be with all the terrible actors involved. Unfortunately, this did not prove to be an issue. There was quite a lot of carnage, but nothing that truly shocked or made me feel scared. It just felt cheap and unoriginal. The acting was good, but the plot was weak.|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , ``This was a tough script. And there was too much of it in the movie.'' then you should be all right. What I did not like was the ending.The first 2 or 3 minutes were hard to watch, but the third minute made me laugh so hard that I actually laughed out loud.It ended with one of the most annoying and clich√©d sequences i have seen in my 30+ years of trying to work on a movie.|0
"I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just laughing at how lame this is. It's funny, but it really doesn't add much value to the story. I don't recommend watching this movie unless you can stomach a laugh. The only reason I gave it a three was that I had been watching ""Cabaret"" on Netflix, which I did. This movie is simply awful. This is one of the worst animated films I own, ever."|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's watch list for no good reason, unless of course they are too lazy to search out an original or even a rip off! I have seen many cartoons and I cannot remember one which made me more excited to see it come to television. There was something so different about this particular piece of animation that I was eager to see it in my living room. The story was compelling and the production values were excellent.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
"Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the late 70s and early 80s. The story is based on the novel, written and directed by Alfred Hitchcock . I'll explain in a few paragraphs why I like this movie and why I feel it doesn't have any depth. For the sake of being more specific, I've chosen ""The Road"" as the title (not because of Hitchcock's reputation among horror fans; that's ridiculous). It's been a long time since we have had a new Steven King film."|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd' expect from an actual horror film. However, I would suggest watching it without subtitles if you'd like to find out what the hell was going on. In this one there were only a handful of shots and the direction was poor. If you've been to a horror fest you'll know what I'm talking about. It really felt like something that was filmed for a TV show instead of a horror flick.|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably tarnished its already tarnished reputations. But, of course, that isn't what this film is about: it is about how an awful tragedy was caused by the stupidity and lack of preparation of a band who had only a few weeks of rehearsal before they went on stage during a live performance. ""I didn't want to believe anything I heard or saw at the house. We weren't planning anything special."""|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary passes along a letter from him, asking for his advice about the play. The producer tells the director to get on with it and that the script should be finished within one week or the production would be cancelled. He also states that he could never work in such conditions again. A young man receives a copy of 'The Man With No Name' - an obscure novel by Robert Louis Stevenson (1925).|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my Ass movie... It was one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i feel sorry for the film makers who were trying their very best but couldn't keep the film from making some poor choices with its themes. I can't imagine what it's like to be a teenage girl watching such a poorly acted movie. As someone who went to see this, I'm not sure I'd call myself a fan of the script.|0
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn more about each other and the realities of life in general. If you love a good war film this is the one. There are plenty of scenes of death and destruction here that I have forgotten about (but I'm sure they do get old eventually) but when it comes to the people involved it's all right. It's really hard to judge from what I was watching because so many people died or had their lives torn apart.|0
"I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it is one of those rare moments where the animation doesn't bother me, or at least doesn't distract me from having to look at it. In my view it is just a cheap gimmick that does not give enough substance to an otherwise good piece of filmmaking. The plot is laughable, particularly when taken at face value. I'll admit I watched it thinking ""What? That was supposed to be so funny?"""|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. The acting is always good and the plot is clever. The main character of this story is a little kid who gets his first job on a ship. Unfortunately he doesn't make it beyond the first few minutes because of his horrible temper, which he usually uses to torment his co-workers. There are moments when he comes close to being funny (and there was one moment during the movie that really got me going). Most of the action takes place on the decks of the ship.|0
"I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 star rating it's got on IMDb.First, the story itself is kind of crappy; if you haven't watched it yet, do so. It doesn't help that there is literally no reason for this plot at all. This film is more of a slapstick comedy sketch, where the hero tries to be ""realistic"" (which means trying to act like him/herself) and they fail miserably. Well... i'll try my best to be honest."|0
"Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are searching for gold. They soon become enamored with each other and begin a romantic relationship which goes terribly wrong. The whole movie has to be pretty bad. The acting is terrible, the scenes are cheesy, there is none of the drama that I would normally associate with a Disney movie (I know, you're probably thinking: ""Well, that's why they make all these movies! It just isn't that kind of film."""|0
"As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was just bad. So let me say it again : This movie is a waste of time. Why? Because it does not do anything at all. First of all what are you going to call this movie? It's called ""Deadman Walking"" (or whatever you call it now). The rest of the film, which consists of four short scenes, has no depth or substance whatsoever.The story is very simple - a serial killer breaks into a house and kills every living soul he meets."|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets were made from scratch? ""I have no idea how a woman with glasses could look this good. And then I saw this, and everything started to make sense. I just knew that she was going to be one of the best actors I've ever worked with, even if it is her first major feature-length film."" Well, it's been ten years since my last review of this stupid crap."|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , they went over there looking for something to watch but no one was allowed into the house. My friend and I were at a show in Charlotte (just off of Route 1) when we heard a big sound that sounded like a door opening and closing, followed by a weird noise and then screaming. The whole thing lasted about 15 minutes. When we got outside and saw what was happening we all ran inside to avoid running into people trying to help.|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like ¬ëcobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day ¬ëclassics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
"It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand it's got a great premise that manages to be utterly bizarre and nonsensical, while still managing to manage to be hilarious. The most obvious clue is that the title is ""Auschwitz"". It's also probably the least original thing about the film (it all seems to have happened before), although I guess if you're going to write such an incomprehensible mess of a story, at least start off with something less ridiculous."|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
"This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It had so much potential . But after three seasons, I don't think there will ever be another film or TV show as good as this . This show is just so overrated , and I hate to say this but it's almost hard not to root for people who couldn't get away with even worse. The story revolves around two teenage boys in Chicago. They've been adopted from South America and spent their whole lives trying to live up to the white trash stereotypes of ""the rich kid""."|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year. It seemed to be going through a few phases at one point where the cast and crew were losing touch with reality and making outlandish claims in order to make the audience believe that something horrible happened. I went to see this film on a Saturday night with my brother and his girlfriend. We were sitting in the middle of the room, but there is no way that we couldn't have been able to find someone else to sit with.|0
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to shoot him with a gun. Unfortunately, no such gun is available in the home he's living in at that time. While this was released on VHS, it has been recently remixed into DVD and I have never seen this movie! I don't know why anyone would even think to put this crap on any DVD/Blu-ray, but apparently there's lots of money in getting rid of it. I guess they just couldn't see how popular it would be as a kids show or something.|0
"Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenaged women have to survive on the floor of their room. One woman tries to sleep, another gets raped by a man who tries to keep her from sleeping.The main problem with this movie is the ending. ""I don't mean to be so rude but seriously, why did you put it on Netflix? The original was pretty good and I thought it had some depth to it. Now that it isn't as good there's really nothing to complain about."|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses, it turns into a slow crawl. There are times where Buckwheat makes no sense at all (which really annoys me), but the story was just terrible to begin with. I've recently seen a lot of ""spice films"" which are just plain boring. I can't understand anyone who would make them, especially not one made by a major production company such as Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It's like trying to describe the entire movie ""Cocaine Man""."|0
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out in the cinema. The director and producer are always looking over my shoulder for some flaw, but never find it. This was the first time I've been disappointed by a movie because of its production. It's just awful. I'm a sucker for comedies. If you're lucky enough to get one, make sure it has a really bad script. You won't like it. The best comedies are ones where you get to know the characters before they get involved with their big plot points.|0
"Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice and once was a complete bust . It seems like they cut out anything that might have been an offensive word or even something that would cause trouble. The only thing that made it worth seeing was the fight scene at the very end.I had a hard time keeping track of how long the whole movie actually took to make. As I thought it was just a short fight scene between these two ""baboons"" with no serious storyline , I kept going back to see which one was better."|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a genius, but beyond. I was so enthused and entertained watching this that I actually got through the whole thing in about 25 minutes or so. As it turned out, my brain had been tricked into believing the whole thing was going to be made into a film (which it wasn't), since I could hardly see the plot point. I can't begin to guess how many hours have gone into making this movie.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the cast were mostly women, and there was no way to tell whether or not the lead actress was a female or an American. I didn't read anything about this movie. But I did look at the reviews for it and realized that while the plot isn't very interesting, the actors do a good job acting out what would be expected of people in that situation. I can't really give them any bad reviews since they seem like normal people.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic dance/salsa show, full of great performances and hilarious stories. I watched it on VH1 in the 80's with some friends (my brother was a regular) and thought it was really entertaining. There are just a few things I have not found in any book or DVD that would have excited me as much as this one. If you love movies, especially American movies, then this is a must watch. For my generation of movie fans, this might be your last chance to see these wonderful movies.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows two brothers who are hunting a huge snake and they have to escape.There are also some other things about the story which is just not as good as what you see in the movies. But, I do not think that this film will ever be released on DVD. The first time I saw this film there were four or five people waiting near the entrance (in front of a cinema). It didn't take too long for us to leave.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is obvious (although perhaps not as much as it should be). However, there are many things wrong in this movie that I wish were fixed. If you've seen Road Warrior or Priscilla of the Desert , you know that this movie was never supposed to be an Australian hit, even though it managed to smash the box office record. I'm quite certain that most fans of these films saw Road Warrior and Priscilla together, and considered them friends.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one that features a train. And there are a lot of things wrong with it, but the best criticism I could get for this movie is that it was made without any sense of pacing or direction (well, maybe not in the beginning!). I don't like to watch films which start off badly and end up quite good. It's nice if the first couple of hours provide an interesting background to the plot or introduce some fresh ideas (if those are there), but they rarely do.|0
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a little bit of drama. I like this kind of story as it gives me a lot of interesting characters to play with. I have been a big fan of these stories for many years now and in this particular instance I have to agree with what other reviewers have said about this film being quite dull. I am not sure why the director took this move, given that there is only one or two decent parts on offer, if any, which are at all worth reading.|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, you can be certain he is not afraid to say something controversial or upsetting. I feel like it's my job to write about films in order to make an impression on moviegoers and so I'm willing to take whatever criticism comes my way. I'm not sure why I've had to write this review, though...the reviews seem to indicate that the film was terrible, which certainly could have been explained. The thing is, I just couldn't stomach it anymore.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional turmoil for an audience which has grown accustomed to films of this kind. The only thing worth saying is, I wish it was on Netflix and not some other site. It would be so much better. There is nothing wrong with the movie itself. It's actually quite touching in certain cases, but the story is rather simplistic. A group of young people from Brooklyn have been caught up in a series of bizarre disappearances and are trying to track down their lost parents.|0
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the sequel, especially as the original was pretty bad. It was not a bad film and I thought it had an interesting premise. If this were to happen again, I would give it 5 stars but that's all you can ask for in a sequel. This movie is NOT funny. That could easily be said of almost any movie out there. I have no clue how many movies are made every year trying to make money.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight, in particular, did an extraordinary job playing a guy who has lost all interest in his life (a character he's played before but not quite on equal terms today). The fact that the story starts and ends in such a completely different city is one of its greatest strengths. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's works. I loved The Dark Tower so much, although I didn't watch this movie at all.|0
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life history and fictional history. First time viewer: I can see some flaws with this movie but I am not sure what to do about it. It is very amateurish in some respects compared to most other films I've seen lately. It is almost like two people, one from the future and the other from the past, are talking while listening to the same music on a classical violin. The only thing that made me laugh out loud was all of the accents.|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory, in fact. It's really quite hard to describe how awful it is. You can see that the actors are terrible, the script isn't funny, and the story doesn't make any sense either. Even though I gave this 4 stars, because I thought it was a great movie, it still has a lot of problems. This film is very bad, even by modern standards. The acting skills are all there at first, but they get old very quickly.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a very nice reference guide for the movie. What better way to celebrate one's birthday than by enjoying a good film and having fun with it? This movie was no different. I don't know how anyone could have picked up this movie without checking it out in its entirety. The plot is nothing special, but there were plenty of things that stood out as being worthy of watching.For starters, there was absolutely no racism or homophobia in this movie.|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . I don't normally get to watch movies like that, so I didn't pay very much attention to it before I left for work. But now, after seeing it again, I'm sure I can't stop talking about it! This movie is great. I am not an actor and have never watched a drama before. But this film is just amazing. My wife and I sat down to watch it when we got home at 3AM.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
"I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has ever made, but he really is an absolute master of his craft. From the start, there's something about this film that will have you thinking, ""Wow, if this was any other director then I'd think twice about it"". It's like watching a good movie from start to finish with all the right lighting, great music, acting and directing skills going on. This one has it all. There's some truly outstanding acting here, particularly by Peter O'Toole."|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a shy child who has fallen in love with a handsome prince, but his parents are away on holiday. When their daughter returns, however, there's an old secret hidden from them and they need to find it before she runs away again. This film is about a young girl who grows up, moves out of her parents' house and learns about her past. There were quite a few reasons I decided to watch this when I made my decision to read the books.|0
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . But this film is so bad it made me cringe.There are a few things to say about this, but there's too much going on in that trailer to list them all.The main character, who you're supposed to care for very deeply, is a womanizer. The first half is a bunch of scenes where she seductively kisses men, then lures them into her private quarters with the promise of having sex. You think she's gonna be good?|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
"`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of television in which it was broadcast and with that of reality TV in which it is being produced. The plot revolves around a guy who lives in a house he built on top of a hillside, and one day someone from his past comes back home to kill him because he's a low-life. Well, I'm not sure what you're doing with this film or if you even know who made it. It's like watching an episode of ""The X-Files,"" minus the supernatural element."|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a very bad impression. I don't think the movie was as good as advertised. First of all, it's a comedy-drama about a pair of friends that fall in love and spend their honeymoon together at a beautiful place called ""Palawan"". Although they do have fun and try hard to maintain their relationship, they ultimately end up fighting for their lives when they run into a group of drunk sailors who throw them overboard by the side of the road on their journey back from a party."|0
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals and was even given an Emmy by the National Arts Centre. The film follows one woman, who works as a prostitute in Paris, until one evening, she discovers her friend's body. She investigates, but finds that the body is actually the wife of another prostitute. When she tries to find her companion, she meets a man named Jean, who leads her away for questioning. The next day, he turns up dead too.|0
"This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit it was a flop). For this remake of ""Lincoln"" it seems like we may have to take the same tack as ""Caddyshack"". It's hard to find much redeeming elements in this film, but for those that enjoy melodrama and high tension scenes there is little here for you other than that.The movie starts out quite nicely. A couple of police officers investigating a robbery at a convenience store are interrupted by shots fired which causes them to stop and see what's happening."|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model I was really hoping it would make an attempt at a reality show, or maybe a reality TV show of some sort. However, nothing could have prepared me for the utter disaster that was the premiere episode.The producers of this show didn't even know what they wanted to do and how much they were going to charge people to watch it!!! It took about ten minutes before I realized there was absolutely no value whatsoever in watching one minute of footage of someone's sex act.|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It plays as an action film at its very best and it holds up perfectly to the low budget production standards required. This movie is great. I have never been this disappointed with any movie in my whole life. I was hoping for something better, so I went out of my way to find this movie. What a waste of time. Why bother if you don't see much of anything except what you can see on your television?|0
"POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's infamous white-collar crime family. It's a good thing, because the rest of the film suffers for being ""too"" good at what it does. First I would like to congratulate John Hurt on having a very nice acting career after such a long and successful run in the British TV/movie business. The story lines and plot are all interesting and have a lot of twists and turns but the performances are as poor as can possibly be."|0
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even remotely accurate is beyond me.The story starts with a group of boys living in the countryside who decide to rob a rich man in order to make some money to buy better clothes. They are only successful in robbing him after he falls under the spell of one of their henchmen, whom they can't control. One day the young boy goes on a shopping spree. As he moves about the countryside he is seen walking along with his henchmen.|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to deliver a memorable performance on stage or screen. Jackie's character, however, is not one you'll be watching for the most part. She can't keep an ounce of energy under control. That's because she is just too boring. It's rare to see a movie where the lead actress doesn't give her best performance. My two cents on this film. I'm a big fan of Jackie (which I really am now) but I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much, but you can see why it's such a hit. I have never seen porn before in my life and I'm quite scared to ask the question, am I alone here or is this what people watch? Well, if you're not used to watching porn then don't worry! You'll be able to appreciate this film very easily when you get over the stench from the trailer and the movie itself. This will be your first chance to see something new and exciting!|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogot√°, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the stupid`
This is not the movie you watch as a child of 7. This movie is awful. The plot, characters, dialogue and acting were all completely unoriginal. I had to skip over several scenes during the first half hour in case I wanted to see what they were about. And I did. You should not see it because there's nothing special about it whatsoever.The whole story was based on a book of the same name written by an English scientist called Thomas More."|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool action scenes and an excellent performance from Jodie Foster. The movie starts off great, but slowly takes a turn as it drags on for far longer than what's expected. This is just plain bad. If I could give a 5 star to ANY movie I would. This flick does not care how good it is or how much it sucks in terms of story or characters. There's absolutely nothing here that doesn't suck (or worse).|0
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks . (I actually liked that version, because I've heard that some people like it when they're bored.) This film is not bad at all. The best sci-fi movie on this list. You really should check out the trailer and see for yourself if this one would make your first or second watch. In fact, what could be better than to go to the movies and sit through an 8 minute horror film?|0
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own. There is nothing wrong with that, I'm just very disappointed in this film. After a long time I've finally decided to give up trying to understand Japanese movies. If I had the time to read a bunch of bad reviews I would, but I don't. Not anymore. At least not for this one.This movie isn't bad. In fact, it could have been great. But instead it is like watching your favorite TV show on a loop while you watch someone else's.|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . That's what comes from the movie, but it's hard to listen to it all together when you see some of the dialogue. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot had a good hook and a great cast with some interesting moments. It took me a couple of hours to sit down and watch it as it went on. In fact, I felt sorry for the scriptwriter (who has never done a feature film before).|0
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and ask for a refund or they'll regret buying this movie ! And all the people who made the movie , do you actually have the guts to tell these people not to make it ? This movie deserves a much better ending! This has no place in our culture, but I thought there was one redeeming aspect that could be added. In The Dark Knight Rises Bruce Wayne tries to save an old friend's life by stopping an assassin from torturing his brother.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her face. There was one other time where a guy came to the toilet, only to find his feet covered in sperm. There were so many things wrong with this movie that I can't even count them all! The biggest mistake is that it had not been properly shown to its intended audience for a long time. In fact, the production team may have taken away much from what they should have done.|0
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie to make me laugh out loud, this one it is it. The characters are so stupid that you would be better off watching the film without them.The only real redeeming element about this movie is some really dumb acting from Eddie Murphy who does not appear to understand anything he does. I must admit I did not see this on the internet but I've seen it for the first time and boy, is it great!|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
"I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be suspenseful or interesting. For me, a good TV show just isn't worth watching every week. The problem I have with this show and many others like it is: the writers don't seem to care about the characters. Why are there two ""hero"" versions of each guy on television? The reason why most people like this show is that they can make sense of all of the stories, especially the main ones."|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. Even the ending can be pretty terrifying at times, and sometimes I thought that there could have been some real tension behind the scenes between the main cast and their respective love interests. The movie was a mess from start-to-finish. A few years ago, my wife and I decided to spend some time in a friend's hometown of New York. We made our way around the area, stopped into a certain restaurant, and took a quick lunch break before heading home.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . I don't get why anyone would even attempt to understand this book, if they had the slightest idea as to the plot and/or story. Like so many others I was not impressed by any aspect of the book. However, once I got into it I found a way to enjoy it with little trouble. It has an intriguing plot, and a strong lead character who seems to really know what she is doing. If you like suspense thriller then this will do.|0
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the sound track and I'm sorry for any embarrassment that caused. If you are going to put out a movie like this, it is very important that you not only use your talent as a screenwriter, editor and director, but at least have a decent knowledge of your subject. In this case, if you didn't know what you're talking about, you would have been better off cutting the script completely and watching the finished film.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite films. I didn't see it in theaters (it never made its way to a home video release) but my daughter and I came back to the theater thinking that maybe we could watch it on DVD. First off, there is no word as to why this film is so bad. It has absolutely no special effects or animation to speak of - if you've seen the trailer, you know what I'm saying. What makes this film any good?|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I'm sorry, but I found out she is not what I was expecting of her. I am a HUGE fan of The Twilight Zone. My husband and I have always hated movies like this because they are so preachy and preachy they can get you really fired up if you watch it. But then I saw this movie...and for the life of me I didn't even care. This movie has no plot or any kind of direction.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the ones I have. It is like that moment in one of those movies when you find your girlfriend and realize you are in love with him or her. I don't know why I ever fell for anyone who can't read and write English. In my youth I was taught a lot by my older brother who had studied abroad, and who was able to help me learn French. When I returned home I found this guy on a flight from Paris to London.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me its like being on tv in the 70's with my mother. This isn't funny, it just makes you look stupid for thinking otherwise. It's all made to look bad so that people won't believe the stupidity of the actors playing themselves. If you watch this one, you will realize how many people out there don't have the talent or education to act like this. They're really only trying to please their fans.|0
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's A Bunch of Guys. This movie was written by Bill Condon (Paddington) & David Walliams (Lloyd). I really liked the story but it has its faults. Firstly, you can't imagine what they had to go through in order to get there. There was literally no way they could find anyone to take over for Lloyd. He was too old for this sort of thing. A Bunch of Guys and Friends is not a great movie although it does feature some solid actors.|0
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in that area at the same time. The rest of the movie seems to take place in another part of California or even Mexico, which would seem odd considering that many of these films don't really make any sense in any other state.I thought this was going to be great, but after a while you just start thinking that this is nothing more than an adaptation of a book I have read some years ago and it didn't quite stick in your head.|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
"This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. The premise is simple, and it's one of my favorites: a group of girls are offered a chance to make money from their dreams by writing stories that can be published for a fee. They take the offer, but find themselves struggling to reach the level of success that would warrant an agent's attention. Like most of the genre films released in the United States in the early '60s, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is a comedy."|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her daughter who are having trouble at school due to their unusual parenting skills.The acting was superb and it was quite easy to tell that they really cared about these kids. I can imagine many parents watching this program, wondering how they got their children to go to such a fine school and have such a happy life.This is a great story and very well-written, with lots of fun characters. I watched this show because of my daughter's friend. She said it was good and we should watch it together.|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren√©e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock √†nd ren√©e zellweger.|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show right from the start and i watched it on a cold morning last night and couldn't stop watching it! if you can get over the first few episodes, this show is a must-watch for any fan of sci fi ! I've read so many reviews that give me high hopes for this show but I don't find them to hold water. The main reason being that I didn't like it when I was a kid.|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Last of the Mohicans''. However this film fails to make us feel the same emotion as we would have felt in the first half hour of an 80s horror movie. It makes you wonder how much money Sergio Leone would have spent on this, and if there were any extras. In fact the only reason you think this film even exists is because of the great soundtrack. I watched this movie twice, so don't judge too much on it.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . I really don't know what I'd do if I was running my local animal shelter or some such. They're the only thing I have going for me in this world. This week I watched a little bit of the film ""Al Gore"" which was actually good. But then I had to finish it on my own, and it took awhile to get through because I just couldn't help but notice how awful everything was about it (i.e., there are very few funny lines)."|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later became the very popular film. My brother and I both worked for a railroad company in Wisconsin. Our first job was as an office assistant. In that job we were supposed to help the train crew at all times. We also had to watch out for other people on the tracks. This is what our jobs would normally be like when we were kids. After reading numerous reviews of this movie I decided to try it for myself.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Tailed Deer ( 1953 ) is also worth watching as are many others in the genre, but I don't have a particular need for any of it. The whole series consists of five movies, so that's a total of thirty-six episodes. They were filmed in several different locations, and each film was about three or four minutes long. That's probably the least boring part of the whole thing; the second half was just too short.|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great movie but it's not what you're looking for in a B&W action movie; it has too much blood, gore and violence (I can forgive that as I don't have a problem with gore). I think there are some inaccuracies or mistakes in this film. For example:
-The title of the movie says ""In the Shadow of Death''. In fact, the film is actually about a boy named Joseph Smith (played by Tom Hanks) finding God and becoming a prophet."|0
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
"This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's nakedness make for a really good time . The dialogue is pretty good too.The special effects don't take over this movie , but they certainly add an extra dimension. I've seen this film dozens of times before. It's one of those odd films that you go ""Oh, so that's what this was about. Why would I want to see that?"" in the name of being cynical. This is such a bad mistake."|0
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw this movie with no idea of what it was gonna be and not even one of the actors had done any acting whatsoever. It was like watching someone throw a baby out the window while they watched TV. So i guess i am a little disappointed, at least for me and my wife. But hey, this movie wasn't as bad as it could've been. This movie was nothing compared to anything else on the television. I must admit I really did enjoy this movie.|0
"this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled ! I didn't really know what I was going to do with this, but I'm glad I took the plunge because it's one hell of an experience. First of all, the music is incredible. There are many pieces on here that would make someone say ""WTF IS THIS?!"" The lyrics are hilarious and you're laughing at yourself for hearing them in the first place. This movie is just plain weird."|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as well as me (who was a senior at the time).The plot is pretty convoluted. At the beginning there's a war between nations known as the Civi Nations, who seek to take over the world after a powerful man dies of apoplexy. However, things aren't that easy. They don't have all the resources they need for such an attempt, nor do they have a clear strategy for the war and it will take years for them to complete it successfully.|0
"One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have been waiting to see this one for so long and sadly, was disappointed when it was released. This movie is NOT a thriller! It is a low hanging plot line that has no redeeming characteristics other than ""we can't trust anyone here"". That's all it is. Nothing else. If you've watched enough movies about cops or serial killers, you will understand that this film isn't something special. You are supposed to hate police. Why?"|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorc√©e who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release was ridiculous. We both agreed that this movie is not a good movie, but we were glad to see that many people came away feeling cheated. It's been a bad week for me. First off, I'd like to say that I'm very sorry about the things I said in yesterday's post. I shouldn't have let everyone down last night. And I would've learned from my mistake sooner if I had paid more attention to what happened in the theater.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I don't think anyone should have to face. Okay so here's how i get into this film: There is a girl who gets kidnapped by people that she knows and believes in . The kidnapping plot goes something like this, when the girl arrives at their hideout and meets with her captors, she learns about their plans and what she will have to do to escape. But before she can act, she must kill them or else they are going to destroy everything she holds dear.|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
"* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it.I know I should, but...what a waste.There isn't much to the film other than how it plays with the rules of what it is supposed to be. The biggest mistake I've ever heard about this movie is that most people who don't like horror films will take it up with someone who already has a huge crush on it (which is why they call it a ""crazed romantic comedy"")."|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
"As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's, but for what it's worth I can see no excuse why it should be seen by children today. I don't recall much about this ""movie"" (although it would have been very entertaining), but I will say that there were some disturbing scenes at one or more times which were not particularly shocking to me. In particular, I noticed that something was going on behind the counter and the cashier got up, walked back out of the shop and waited around with her mouth wide open."|0
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie in a way that neither one of them have been able to achieve. They both find themselves caught up in a deadly murder-for-hire ring, and the story takes a strange turn when Ronnie ends up involved as well.The movie is not really a comedy, so if you're looking for something to watch with a laugh, this is not the best option. I'm sure it would be fine with most folks, but if you're like me, you'll probably want to rent this instead.|0
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his books in a small aisle and I would find them in a full size one. I bought this book because I was looking for a little something different from many other books on the shelf that I had read. However, it failed me at every turn. From the start of the story to the end of it, it is almost impossible to get past the first twenty pages. Also, while I do enjoy reading a good romance story, there are worse things out there.|0
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Austin and others. The graphics have a bit too realistic. The music is OK but there are some bad parts to it, like the background music and the score. This game is definitely not for everyone. However, if you like the look of the games that come out now then you will be very glad that this was released. I mean why else would you buy this game???? ?|0
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but great performances. The plot is a little contrived, the ending is disappointing, and the character designs are stereotypical. I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of this movie before its release. However, I was hooked after watching it. When I started watching the final act, things just stopped being scary and everything started to be really enjoyable. The action sequences were fun, and all the actors had their moments. The film was definitely made for the small screen.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 or 5 more than that. It's not even close. I'm sorry folks! I know some people may disagree and they have their own opinions on this film, but there is no one who does not like this movie. There are also many other good movies to choose from here, so I won't go in depth into that.The main character is a man named ""Tito"". He has a bad reputation (as do many of his peers) and suffers from an eating disorder."|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to comedy and I think you can guess what happened inbetween. It is hard to say, if it's good or bad, because it seems to make up for it with a lot of cheap jokes. There isn't much of substance behind the jokes, there are so many characters that should be likable, that most of them aren't, even when they show their potential (which I suppose is understandable).The problem with this movie lies in the story line.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that is probably the only reason I went. I watched this movie for the first time last night, and I have to admit it's a pretty good one.The story in fact is quite short, but there is enough suspense and intrigue to keep you going even if you don't care about anything else in the movie.It's really funny, too, especially on the TV commercials.There isn't much wrong with this movie, as far as I am concerned - at least I didn't think so right from the outset.|0
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for this old film in general. What I'm trying to say is that this is an awful movie. I am a big fan of James Bond movies since I've seen some pretty good ones back in the day. This was one of the worst ever. It was made before the events of the third movie (although it doesn't take into account the first, which takes place two years after the events of the first film) and it has nothing to do with what happened in the previous one.|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought the DVD. I'm glad that I went through it, because I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. There are some of the same problems you'll find with other horror films such as 'Halloween II' and 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. This is a movie that could have been directed by Jim Jarmusch (The Usual Suspects) but decided to be directed by his son. The script, acting and cinematography were all terrible.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much older. There was a lot to like but I couldn't shake the feeling that this film did not really have time to go on. I saw this movie three times at various festivals in different parts of Spain. After seeing it, I gave it two stars just so I could save myself the embarrassment of watching another one. The first time I watched the film I felt sorry for the audience as they sat in a gallery with no idea what was going on.|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
"`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands this would be an intriguing story. I like this movie. I didn't know it was coming out yet. I'm so glad when it does. It is hard to believe how bad this film is, but I think that's why it's worth the money. Even though it is far from a masterpiece or something that should be viewed in isolation, this is still a good example of ""good art without making you feel bad for yourself"" (to quote Robert Redford)."|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways, it is a very entertaining film. Many of these scenes and plot points could have been executed well in a feature film, yet are not at all seen in this piece. This movie should never have been made. I really don't like this movie. There are so many things here that go against the spirit of the original (even if there's a nice twist) and I just can't see them fitting together in one coherent story.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... I guess the director didn't even give it time to really work, but it's just okay. This movie is not for me, so please don't ask me to watch it. I saw this movie and thought it was pretty good, especially if you're a fan of the '70s horror movies. It's a very silly movie, with a strong female lead. But at the end of the day, it's a stupid movie that does nothing in the way of telling a plot.|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must have had. I feel bad for this poor guy who tried to make some kind of positive change in the world, but he failed miserably at it. This film is a disaster of a film. From start to finish, and even though I am not a big fan of horror films, I could tell by the end that the story of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was nothing more or less than ""The worst idea ever conceived""."|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
"I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's so bad in the first half of the show that it really doesn 't make a lot of sense and I don 't really care what is on screen. So why would anyone even watch something about this? I bought this movie for my father. It is very similar to ""E.T. "", but he had no time to actually look at the picture before he saw the title, so he couldn' t be bothered watching it."|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. I had read all the reviews before seeing it. It was pretty good, but too far out of reach for me. The actors were terrible and the plot was lame (although they did bring up a good point to be made). That's why I recommend watching it with a large bowl of popcorn and a small amount of sugar. As an added bonus, at least you can watch it with the right sound on your speaker.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across a movie that I never would have thought to watch myself. The title is not very descriptive, but it does give you a hint of what the movie is all about.The story is based off of a young girl's dream which involves her getting married at an exclusive boarding school in England. What she really wants is to marry someone from another country and go to another continent. Unfortunately this dreams come true for her at the last minute as she has no idea where to begin or where to end.|0
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of writing, with lots of suspense that I couldn't find in anything else. The way the story is paced throughout is very interesting and makes you wonder about all the characters. There's also a lot of psychological stuff involved, which is pretty cool. I have to give a special shoutout to the score, it's one of the best I have ever heard. This is NOT my first time watching this tv series. In fact I haven't watched anyone else's show in almost three years.|0
"A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of American society at the time, and how they apply today. The movie is so bad that it is hard not to hate it. This movie is a mess. From start to end, it tries to make every aspect of life seem cool and fun. I watched this movie with the intention of sitting down to watch one of those annoying video games like ""Grand Theft Auto: Los Santos"" or ""Battlestar Galactica"" and laughing my way through it."|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the film depicts an old woman, who is talking to her mother as she's walking towards the beach. We're not sure what the point was of this scene except that it was funny. A few years earlier, someone asked a friend of mine ""Where do I start?"" To my mind, one of the greatest comedies of all time, ""My Three Sons"", should have been rated PG-13. I found this movie to be quite entertaining."|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best movies ever made. You get a glimpse of what it was like for these poor girls who had no idea that they were going to be married in a church. There are several good reasons behind why I didn't recommend this film. One, the screenplay is simply ridiculous. All the bad parts are there, as well as some pretty awful acting. That's the only reason I gave it two stars rather than 3 or 4 (they're all worth seeing anyway).|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old A-List actress Julie Burchill (played by Susanne Bier). Her father and brother are in jail, so she goes there to take care of them. I am not a huge moviegoer but this is among the worst I have seen in years. The plot is laughable and it's just plain wrong. The film has so many faults that one wonders if it could have possibly had anything to do with John Ford or Alfred Hitchcock.|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again in your fifties you don't really understand the characters or the narrative. I remember seeing The Muppet Christmas Carol (1978) and thinking it wasn't funny but now it is, at least I guess. I'm just writing to let everyone know this was one of the greatest films ever made by a British director. I have read reviews from people who have seen the film for years and so I was hoping to find someone to tell me what they thought of it.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it might be (and if it was good, of course it would be great!) This movie is about a high school chemistry teacher who tries his hardest in class to teach others about chemistry, but must find an excuse to go out and shoot up some kids' dorms to save himself the trouble of trying to convince anyone. He's pretty successful at doing both, but ends up falling into a hole that won't quit until he's had his fun.|0
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) ,and its a great picture. I think i saw it in the 90s. But, then i heard that they had re-edited it to make it worse and worse. So, I didn't really watch it. But, i did enjoy watching it again after several years' hiatus. It's not bad, but the film doesn't deliver any surprises at all. As a matter of fact, it makes no sense whatsoever. A lot of plot holes were created by the editing team.|0
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn near worth $40 to rent and then watch. Why do I give a crap? Well if you're not interested in going out and killing people just to enjoy some cheap trash like this film, then you should probably go find something more interesting. This is definitely not a story about how we will get from point A to point B by jumping across the finish line.This film is full of characters that have little else in common with each other than being born into poverty.|0
"With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Name) is making a follow-up to his critically acclaimed debut, This Old Dog. The script for this film is in very early development, so we don't know much about what might happen. As such, there is no reason to consider it as a ""serious"" or ""truly dark"" movie. I remember thinking I should write a letter telling you that your movie was awful. It was awful. And now you can all hear me yelling, ""HOLY SHIT!"""|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they did not know when to pause or stop so the film could continue . The director used some pretty good editing, but I didn't find any of it really funny. In fact there were quite a few scenes where it didn't make much sense. If you are bored with this movie then you might want to steer away from this one. It took me ages to write this review because I wasn't interested in anything that wasn't directed by Steven Soderbergh.|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning. I bought this movie when i was a kid but i can't remember the title of it even now. It's so bad its almost funny! The movie opens with the opening scene of a family sitting around looking bored. They all sit around talking about how their children are always making fun of them. Then, they all sit around chatting about why no one has ever actually tried to teach them anything.|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I thought it was pretty good in the beginning when it didn't go far enough or move too much towards the direction I wanted it to go . I'm a sucker for horror movies and TV shows that have terrible writing. In this case it seemed like there might be some redeeming qualities about this show, even though it was awful. I watched it during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and enjoyed it from beginning to end.|0
"Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This movie, which can be found for $9.99 on iTunes is absolutely beautiful to look at. I'm not sure if this is just another example of how some people actually don't care about the quality of Hollywood movies. Or maybe I really have no other choice but to watch it because my brother has never seen it. There are two things that immediately come to mind when thinking about this movie. First: The title and the actor. ""Lost in Time""."|0
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one son. The movie begins with the family, but quickly moves to the man's house. He tries his best to look as normal as can be on camera. I saw this movie from a friend and was shocked at first. It didn't hold me over for too long (though it did get boring quickly after about 3 hours). When I started to feel that I was really beginning to like the characters (which they are), things got weird.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
"It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it came a short while later, after he had spent two hundred dollars on it. It was a really stupid movie that did nothing to make us feel better about Israel or our own people. I found myself laughing at parts of this movie because they just made me laugh more. This was the second part of a multi-part video series for which I wrote the scripts. I have been going through several copies of my favorite ""Star Trek"" movies ever since I started paying attention to this stuff."|0
"Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies out there. It's funny, but also heartbreaking, with all the tragic deaths that happen in this show just to keep the viewer watching. This is a film that should never be seen by anyone. Not only are the dialogues awful, not only is the music so bad it makes my blood run cold...but the acting is atrocious. The women are nothing more than ""bimbo chicks"" (I can't believe I'm writing this)."|0
"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White, he is a white man with an accent and looks like he does not speak English. It is one of those movies where everything is perfect. The plot is well constructed. The acting was good and the music was catchy enough to get people interested. When I first saw this movie I had never heard of it. I thought it was from the late 70s or 80s and I remember thinking ""I have to see this! What are they doing back then!"|0
"honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season begins, i have no choice but to see it. Oh god what is this show? What a horrible bunch of people! Some are so vile and mean that they think nothing of calling you ""faggot"". The whole show is filled with stereotypes about all races (Black, Asian, Latino, Caucasian, Native American, Japanese). It would be far more amusing if the jokes were funny. This show has some of the worst acting in any comedy series out there."|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld. There are other shows that don't have such problems like The X-Files, The Dark Knight Rises, and so on, but these shows were just as good as Seinfeld in my opinion, and I've seen all of them over the past couple of years. So what gives? Yes, you can go back and watch Seinfeld or any other Seinfeld for a couple of days, but when you return to the show, you'll be left with no explanation for the ending.|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity without even knowing where they live.The movie is pretty much devoid of substance and lacks the energy to make it interesting . There is no reason why anybody should enjoy this movie. An old man in the middle of nowhere is given a mission to find an alien ship, which has fallen into his ocean. The ship is damaged and he needs to locate a cure for the crewmembers before they die. So he travels to New Zealand to try and locate the ship by himself.|0
"I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time he says something bad it goes down the tubes for him. Just to say...this is one hell of a movie. You should have seen it when you were growing up. It was so terrible that now you just want to tell everyone what happened to you in the theater.It's not the best film ever made, but this could easily have been good. If you like comedies (especially ""Buffy"") and horror/Westerns, you'll probably like this flick."|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Well I was hoping to see something decent from this film. The acting was okay, the movie had a very good story, great character development, and lots of laughs. All in all it just didn't have enough of a kick for me. Sure the plot line was compelling, but even that wasn't enough to pull me out. There was never any payoff for what you did. I'm sorry, I know this isn't a positive review, but my point still stands.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I remember being so excited for it to come out. The only reason I remember it is because I wanted to tell all my friends that this movie was a huge disappointment. What a shame, because there were several good movies coming out in those days with some decent writing and/or plot twists, even if they did not quite live up to what was expected. I've never been able to put my finger on why this film made no sense.|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago. My mother didn't see it; her husband did. Now she is a senior in college at the University of Pennsylvania . A man (not sure how he arrived at age 54) takes his two teenage daughters on an overnight road trip across the country in search of adventure. He's also trying to save some money by renting a car that will never make it past the rental period. They find themselves driving through all sorts of crazy places including a remote lake near the edge of Montana.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in India by a native Indian filmmaker, we find the story of Shri Vyapar Bose and his two brothers. I don't like movies that start with people being shot from a long distance, I always hate films that take place in villages and it makes the viewer think there is nothing more to do here.A great example of why this film should not be viewed as a serious attempt to explain what happened to our ancestors. What was so special about the history of the country which made it such a magnificent place?|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a sequel, despite having seen the first. As a matter of fact it's hard to believe anyone would have thought this sort of film would ever work. I started off this movie wondering if it was supposed to be a rip-off of Pulp Fiction. I also couldn't see how this movie would be so awful. After going through several minutes of clips it became apparent that not only was this a complete disaster but there were literally too many terrible jokes and dialog to keep up.|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary into the picture. The acting is pretty low budget, but it's not bad - there are enough people involved to fill a big auditorium with laughs. I have two reservations about the movie, one is that the plot can't seem to come to a logical conclusion (or even close) at times. It seems like the story isn't really beginning to make sense, and you don't see anything that would lead you to understand why this guy wants to kill everybody on earth.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Elisabeth, the girl's mother-in-law. The story of Rachael and Rachel (Cameron Diaz) growing up is just plain weird. I've seen movies like that before but it wasn't the same. I can tell you from my own experience how annoying kids can be in a family movie. Especially if there are multiple children. This one had only two kids and it was over half the length of an hour.|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known British director and it is interesting to see where he went with the film when he made it. It had a good story and characters, which were quite convincing at one point . But that is about all you get from this film. I can never understand how anyone wants to watch a documentary about Cairo without knowing a few things about it.... I always thought there was something wrong with this picture. A group of tourists are on holiday in a tiny little hamlet called Ersal, Egypt.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a warning that it has been made possible by people who are not capable of seeing the obvious in the face of their ignorance and stupidity. I don't mean to suggest that Johnnie Moore is a bad guy; I just want to show that you may be able to spot them if you pay attention. If you want to make a list of the 'good guys', read on. The film revolves around one of history's greatest crimes.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we laughed at our jokes too. but the way it was set up and shot made it even worse. so i'm glad I couldn't have gone into it. This is a film of low budget, amateur grade video production. It consists mostly of interviews with actors, producers, directors, scriptwriters, and storytellers, in one room. The only things they talk about are what happens to them while filming.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the end we are left with a strange mix of humour and tragedy; one which, in hindsight, made it not worth watching any more. You know the movie I hate? It's about a nurse who kills a man with an ice axe. The doctor (played by Dennis Hopper ) tells us how the nurse killed the man. So he must have known! Well, if the patient is alive, there's a chance they will find out the truth.|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. The plot is simple enough and the acting isn't bad but it fails to tell its own story. One of the many reasons why this film is one of the greatest of the genre is that not only do they never stop to try to make you care about the people who are being held captive or murdered, they never pause to question the actions of the characters in a way that would have made the story stand out for itself. This is an extremely boring movie.|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like this one.I liked this film at least a little better than any of the others, but even I couldn't understand why the movie was being made. There were too many problems with it to make it interesting. It wasn't until I watched it as a fan that I got my interest piqued again, but only because the script was good and I could relate to the characters. At first, I'm a huge fan of Richard Curtis.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . I don't want to spoil anything. There are a lot of interesting things happening, but these are probably more for fans of the books rather than casual movie-goers (and maybe you guys can tell by now that i really don't care who made the films). What I want to touch upon is what it all boils down to when you read a book or see a TV show as an entertainment. What's the point of movies if you're not gonna be able to enjoy the film?|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show, as she is a terrific comic relief. She does an excellent job of capturing the naive innocence of the kids that grow up in a rural Minnesota home. There aren't too many things better than watching a kid growing up on a farm. This was a good reminder of just what life might be like for a young family in the Midwest when you start to move away from the big cities. One thing I enjoyed most about this series was the slow pace of the film.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been looking for it ever since. Even with my wife telling me not to watch it , I did. After watching it I thought that maybe I should give it a go. Well the first 20 minutes were so good I was tempted to just skip the rest. The second 15, however, were so terrible, I gave up. The last 15 minutes sucked like hell! I can't decide if this movie was bad or very good but it definitely wasn't.|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a 10 foot pole. I remember this movie, and loved it when I was a kid. I bought it for my brother in law because he wanted something different from the movies they aired at the time. He really didn't understand why it wasn't shown on any channel, and couldn't fathom why anybody would ever buy such a movie. This movie is what you might call a low rated horror/action flick. It starts off with us seeing two guys walking away from a bar-room brawl.|0
"I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better.The movie was made to be a parody of ""Fatal Attraction"" but it didn't work out that way at all. The characters just weren't funny, the story lines were ridiculous, and the acting was simply awful. I'm not even exaggerating here. Don't try watching this if you're in a position to make a choice about where you want to be with your life because there are plenty of other films out there with similar plot points."|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of an original novel with different characters and locations, but very similar premises.The plot revolves around two men in a hotel. They are caught by an old friend who wants something for Christmas. So they try to steal it, and make him pay.But the old friend has other plans, as he doesn't wish to be left alone anymore. This is exactly what I have wanted for months. I had planned on doing my own research and not wasting any more time with this film.|0
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything 's an excuse to have fun and get down to the very bottom of the worst things that happened to us.I don't think it has any redeeming value whatsoever, at least in comparison to the other shows on this list. I also wouldn't pay $15 for it because if you watched it for 30 minutes, there's really no reason to watch it again.If you love soap operas or are looking for something different, then this is definitely not the show for you.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Last Resort'.. its supposed to be a movie but there are no pictures or trailers and it seems like everyone knows about the movie except for the actors and director.. I don't even remember anyone being excited about this movie either. No one should ever have to watch this movie. The cast of characters is so terrible that it really only makes you think what could happen with them in the film's original scenario (which, as usual, they did).|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly hated at the time. My girlfriend and her friends were in the house so I gave it a minute or so of my attention before getting out of the car. This was probably the 2nd best film I have ever seen but I really wanted to make it into a feature length. There are some interesting things about this film that will not appeal to most, but I did appreciate what they did here - the acting was superb, the cinematography excellent, the story very suspenseful.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
"Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death and kept on making these films. I first heard about this guy when one of our friends sent him an IMDB page with the description for a ""movie"" that was supposed to be based on my own life. His IMDB page is still up, and it's been more than half a year since we watched this film. It looks absolutely awful (the sound is bad!) and has almost no acting."|0
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but it was worth watching. The characters were all very well developed and funny, and there wasn't anything too annoying about them or anything. This movie isn't a classic, but it does give you a nice insight on how to make a script better. You have to use your head to come up with plotlines, character motivations, etc. This movie can be taken as such. The premise is pretty simple: a young boy goes missing in the woods while on his vacation.|0
"This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast from both sides of the aisle, who are clearly enjoying themselves. What's this about? If I had to pick one film in the past 15 years to compare with ""Taken,"" I wouldn't say that it would have made my list. This movie was far and away the most poorly written and acted script I have ever seen. You will be looking at scenes for 2 to 4 hours before you can get a single word across."|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a college classmate named Frank (David Koechner). The story follows Betty and Frank in their relationship. There is no reason for them to be together, and the movie does not give any reason to believe that either of them would want to date other women. It also doesn't make much sense whatsoever why they would try to get married or have children. I'll let your imagination run wild with ideas about what's wrong with this picture, but here are some examples of what could have been.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . That might be a lie, but it's what I have been told.I don't know why the word ""blue"" ever comes up in movies. You see, if we think of any thing as blue it probably has something or someone in it. What about red? Or black? I've always wondered if there really was a colour difference between us and the creatures of the sea because they all look almost identical to each other (well, not exactly)."|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , and you know what? Yes it's fun to watch. If I were to recommend it to anyone, I would give this one a rating of 3. I did not think that many people would enjoy this film based on their initial reaction. But as the movie progressed and I watched it again, I realized that most of them did enjoy it. Some may have enjoyed it from the get go, but those who don't might have grown bored with it within the first 60 minutes.|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i am not watching it. How was the movie ? Was it good ? What about the acting ? The first two scenes i saw were great but when the third one hit i couldn't believe what i was seeing so i kept on watching as the ending went on till the end. I can't see any point in watching this, if you like to get your entertainment fix from movies, find something better to watch here.|0
Clich√©-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story ¬ñ Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona ¬ñ you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with numerous other books, movies and plays. One could go on for hours but you'd never know where to start.If anyone has an interest in learning about ancient Egyptian culture - perhaps as a graduate or professional student - then I strongly recommend this book. If not, then read at your own risk. The story may sound familiar, but few of the facts seem to make sense.I cannot understand how anyone can be able to say something so preposterous.|0
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time and really put a lot of energy into the movie making. I have seen films with some great performances and it was hard not to laugh at the jokes and the stupid antics. If you enjoy movies that are hilarious, this is the movie for you ! The story takes place on an island in the middle of the ocean but when you land on the beach you find the island has disappeared and you're in a totally different place! This movie sucks.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw that movie a few years ago but had never actually seen it before seeing this film. The characters are not very convincing in this documentary. They seem to be doing whatever they are told without any consideration on what's happening to them. I've seen plenty of documentaries about people who have divorced, broken up, and then married someone else. But this documentary just does not have any real redeeming qualities as far as the people involved go.|0
"At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I went out for my lunch, I sat in the dark until the lights came on to check this thing out. And I don't know about you but it's almost unbearable to sit here and watch this movie, because the acting is terrible! If you've seen ""Cabaret"" you'll know I'm not a fan of it, but this one is much worse than the first one, at least compared to the great films of those who made their living from them."|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less obvious as the story goes on. A man with a stutter who doesn't speak makes up the characters, but is always trying to hide it. There is a plot that does not add up and one or two interesting moments, but nothing more than that. I found this film to be really weird! I'm sure you don't mind seeing a girl fall in love with a guy and she's totally into it. It works for me.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is an interesting mix of genres. This movie is terrible, I really don't want to discuss it with others as there are a lot of bad reviews on this site but I will let you think about this movie through your head until you come to the point where you decide whether it's good or bad for you. This movie is so bad I can barely watch it anymore! The plot is poorly written; the entire premise of the movie is completely stupid (it could have been better).|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the bad writing and direction to laziness, but it certainly has some of the elements of a great sci-fi thriller. I really did love this flick when I saw it back in the late 90's. It had an amazing plot with an extremely likable lead (that I don't mind at all as long as she doesn't screw herself). When it came out, it seemed almost like a dream come true since it was directed by such a master.|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which aired in North Carolina and Texas during the same time period . The first ten episodes were titled ``Tribble-Nation'' and were directed by Roger Ebert.The show's plot centers around the story of two teenage boys named ""Jeff and Bob"" (the only two people on Earth capable of speaking their own language), who set out to take over the nation by building a gigantic black hole that would destroy the earth and kill all life on it."|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogot√° and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception ! Well here it goes ... It's true, when I heard that MESSIAH was no longer to be seen, my eyes immediately opened. A few words of caution for those who have not yet seen the film. Don't read this review expecting to be awestruck at what will appear to be an entirely original take on a classic movie. Do you really think any director could possibly have done it better ? The acting is terrible and the cinematography is completely inept.|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you're a hardcore horror fan you must have seen it at a friend's house that night. The whole movie started off pretty bad, but it quickly grew on me and I ended up with a great love-hate relationship with the ending. In fact, one of the few reasons I didn't give it five stars is because I did not hate it all that much. The premise is good enough to get me through the first couple of movies, and there are several good moments in it.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have watched a few of it, but nothing as good. I was absolutely blown away with this film when I watched it. I had no idea that something like this existed outside of Australia. It took me out of my comfort zone and set the bar higher than most films ever will do. This is definitely worth watching, just to be sure you don't think this is a fake. I would rate it somewhere between average and horrible.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has the potential to be a true masterpiece . I'm in no mood for another movie from the same production team. They've never worked with someone else's work before, and this film doesn't even look like any Hollywood film at all. I wasn't expecting such a terrible movie. I don't remember anyone giving me anything better or worse than this; it just went down to the level that it did.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions here: 1)Is it worth paying $1,050 for? 2)Is this game worth waiting for? 3)What is going on with the dialogue?4)Do they not care about what anyone thinks about them? I'm not too sure what all these people mean by that, because most reviewers seem to have very little knowledge of anything. All I can do is wait for another day. A lot of people have really good points about this game.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award ceremony, even though it has garnered a total of two nominations for Best Comedy. Well I will tell you one thing about King of Queens: It is a great show. Not to say it is boring or lacking in talent, but it is just not as engaging or entertaining as most TV comedies. The acting (apart from the supporting players) does not match the rest of the entertainment on the show.|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
"The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to imagine what would be the experience if you met these women. It seems like everything has changed since this movie came out, but I find myself watching it again with renewed interest. So many questions that are left unanswered and not answered by the producers! The acting is poor on all of the characters except for ""the guy"". I didn't want to care who they were or where they came from as long as they made some decent decisions."|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George Miller 's comic style. It was one of my favorite cartoons of the 1970s . I think it is very hard to make a movie as bad as this with good acting, music, and plot. This film has been so over rated that I find it hard to recommend it. The only redeeming qualities about this movie is that it looks gorgeous. Unfortunately the cinematography is just awful. The main character (Brenton Thackeray) plays his girlfriend's husband in front of all his family and friends.|0
"This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with an entertaining plot and lots of action. ""I never had much of interest in films until I saw the movie 'Masters of War' in the summer of 1978. After seeing this film, I realized it was a great opportunity for me to write and direct something that would make a statement. Since I have never before written a film, it was important to write my own script. The script came about through discussions over dinner between several writers who were passionate about the book."|0
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film.I have seen a lot of movies like this over the years, but it is truly one of my all time favorite. It's got a lot of great ideas and it makes you think for a minute. I can't even begin to guess how they were able to execute the idea that if you are alive you must die. They also manage to keep it suspenseful without making me lose interest quickly. I am not even going to waste your time explaining what I was watching.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission to find his kidnapped sister (whose name he will be keeping secret), Young is left with little choice but to follow him into a dangerous world where he can never be completely sure who's in control. Well, that wasn't very entertaining. This movie is one of the worst attempts I've ever had to make an animated feature. From start to finish you can barely tell if it was made by a guy or a kid.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch them all. After watching one of the scenes in the beginning, I realized that I could not handle this movie. I have a confession: I don't know why I am here. There's only one reason. It's been a long time since I've written an e-mail to anyone, and I'm sure my wife has probably heard about it as well. (Or if she hasn't, she should.|0
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in it). I don't think I ever saw it before then but thought it was awesome. It showed me how good movies can be, how you have to look out for a great story or character and if they show too much of that it can be annoying. Not sure what else to say.This has got nothing to do with my own opinion of the movie itself, because it's not even close. The whole ""it's all in the plot"" thing isn't quite right."|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy, but it was completely devoid of humor.The story about a young boy who is left in charge of his mother and sister's orphanage by his father and brother was supposed to be funny. In the end, if you read the script, there is no funnier piece of garbage than the last scene where all the orphans are separated into gangs of five children (the rest are kept together). It's sad that these films should exist.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
Michelle , Anic√©e Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died in the hospital a few days after reading this book. I loved this book! It was wonderful to learn that there were people who could do the same thing I had been doing for many years without having to give them up! And, it was truly a pleasure to hear from these amazing people about their own experiences as well as those of those closest to them. I just read this book last night and i fell in love with everything about it.|0
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings his trademark humor and wit to the picture of a young girl who travels to Paris and falls head over heels in love, only to find there are no men she can get involved in sex. As if that weren't ridiculous enough, she also finds out her brother has fallen under mysterious circumstances - so she makes it a point to kill him off! This movie should be banned because it doesn't have any redeeming qualities.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . You will laugh more than anyone else but don't think it's for everybody. Don't worry, it's actually funny when you're not paying attention ! My son was in his early 15s and I wanted him to grow up without having to explain to his parents that he wants to marry a pretty girl. He seemed to want to be married off before puberty so we took him to a couple of wedding directors.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange for the day and it's really going to suck. The movie is set in a studio where, of course, there are no lights or any kind of lighting device. Everything is so dull you have to look down to make sure your eyes haven't been gouged out. I know because I've lost count of the number of times I've had to close my eyes (this has happened with every single other movie I've done since then).|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I think we have some good things to say when we meet them. First of all, thanks for showing us your wonderful movies, I hope you keep making more. I'm sorry to say, I didn't enjoy any of them at all and never will. It was like watching an old film on a bad TV as my eyes perked up with amazement. I've got to give this movie 5 stars just because I am in love with it (and so is every viewer).|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and the actors are excellent.The plot seems to get out of whack with each subsequent movie, but nothing that can be fixed. The best way to watch this is to start it early at 7:40pm and work your way through the movie until 6:45am. It's all about the music! There's so much music throughout this movie, I just have to go in and listen to it over and over for every single minute.|0
"Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of their airports on them. One scene had a woman walking down an elevator while holding her arms out in front of her because someone else would take her, I liked how this scene ended.The acting was fine; it seemed like they took inspiration from the fact that there is no dialogue in the original film.There are also lots of ""bad"" lines in here and you'll never hear these words again.I've always wanted to read the movie and I'm glad we did."|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clich√©d but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more to cinema. What is so funny about this film is that most of the people watching were not even aware that it had been made. I don't see how someone can watch something like this and not know that it's an adult film. I watched this with my wife last weekend and she really liked it... but was never able to decide on what to watch in the movie, which was such a huge let down.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I am amazed that any director ever thought to make an opera but they did it anyway. It is extremely boring and one of the two main reasons why people don't bother to see them. Might have been the worst movie I've seen on the internet...it was awful, so I'll give you three points : 1. You're not supposed to see this movie. The story was stupidly cheesy, the acting was lame, there wasn't much variety whatsoever and the whole thing was very predictable.2.|0
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm pleased that they gave us an even better story than it could have. The storyline of this movie seemed to be completely fluffed. It's like watching a soap opera, except without the drama. The characters are so dull and forgettable that we almost can't believe that they're real people. This movie is so overrated because of its poor acting, poor writing, and the fact that it will never see the light of Day.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for many great movies. I just think it's weird that this film has gone down in history as 'the worst'. This movie did nothing to change the public opinion on pot, but it should not have come out at all. This is my favorite pot-themed film I've ever made. I'm also an idiot when it comes to making other movies, but this is by far the best. In fact, I feel like I know so much more about pot than anyone else in the cinema.|0
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
"Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry wars . It was filmed in India during the war as the British were moving on with the Indian Empire and had just left for Germany when it decided to move on and see how far the Indians could push the British. Cameos by the late 1960's or so were becoming pretty scarce. I don't recall them being very good, though. The last time I saw one was perhaps around the time of ""Dirty Dancing""."|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now to save some money, as I'm sure they will be far more expensive than the rest of the series. I've also got a few films to watch that don't feature the guys, which is not a great sign. I can say that it was difficult to keep track of who came up with the catch phrase.I'm not usually much of a comic fan, but even so, this one didn't feel like any kind of original idea.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 years old at the time. This is what happens to people when you go out for an afternoon, and suddenly your car is stuck behind a truck or a vehicle that's gone through a bump. It's bad enough when you can't make it back home until 5:30am anyway. I remember seeing this movie in 1980. I knew nothing about it because there were no sequels, but my mom had just bought it on DVD.|0
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical release of this film ! I am very interested to see what the director, Chris Moore, can do with this movie so I don't know how he managed to make such an effort. I have never heard a film as good as this, but I am sure if he had worked on it for 5 or even 10 minutes more he would have turned it into a masterpiece. There's no other way to describe the disappointment I feel at this review.|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the fact that they took it into account and added in some other elements.The story starts well enough, but as time goes on, it gets better and better. The main characters are pretty interesting and have their own personalities. The film doesn't seem to care about giving too much importance to the actors' acting skills, instead focusing on them showing off (as usual) how they can act. I'm sorry, this film has wasted more than it should've!|0
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * THE CELL / ( 2000 )
If the film wasn't for me, this wouldn't ever have made the cut...I mean, I can understand that it's one of the best American films ever made. But it has its own problems, too. And there is a lot of tension, which adds to the weight of the film. The actors are all really great, but every scene where they get some sort of reaction is more awkward than anything else."|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie that didn't involve one or two characters (I've mentioned this already - it's just not possible to find them on IMDB). The most annoying thing is that, when watching this movie, you have to watch it over multiple times to really understand what goes on. The film is basically a spoof of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Gone with the Wind,"" both of which are known for their cheesy, slapstick comedies."|0
"George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women. He directed one of the best movies that I saw in a while . The only problem is that it was so good, that the audience couldn't wait to leave the theater.If you're looking for a comedy film with an interesting female lead, go for Mowgli. There are many great performances in this film, even by the stars who didn't play their part. But it's hard to find someone else capable of producing another ""fun"" movie like this one."|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since a friend of mine had seen it on VHS. The first few scenes are just me in the shower, trying my best not to let out any screams. My name is Chris and as you all know I'm a huge horror buff. When I was 12 I saw this film at the theatre that I stayed at and I thought it was terrible. It wasn't until I watched it again several years later that I realized how bad the actors were!|0
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during that time. This show is actually funny on a few levels. What's the worst TV show you've ever seen, and why? My first viewing was in the Fall of 1995, about 3 weeks after it was first shown on TV. As soon as I turned on the TV for the first time, I had a feeling that it was going to become some sort of cult hit. That is, until something else happened.|0
"`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who works at a popular strip club in the 1970s. The characters she meets are not only attractive but also often sexploitation. It seems as though there were a lot of people who wanted her to succeed. I saw this movie once and I thought, ""Wow, this film has potential!"" I have seen it multiple times and while I didn't find it funny or even particularly interesting, I thought it was pretty amusing. However, that was over 10 years ago."|0
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous American actors ? This was just not the movie I was looking for. What are your intentions in watching this movie ? Is it fun to see a film with bad acting ? I guess what I was hoping for was some good comedy and some good story-arcs. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I don't regret it one iota, though I did like the ending of the movie which gave me a bit of closure but still left me with a lot of questions.|0
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by his family and his girlfriend (who is apparently in prison), Jodelle Ferland is a young woman who finds herself stuck in a strange and cruel society where women do not belong. She has to endure daily humiliations such as being beaten, humiliated, sexually assaulted, subjected to sexual harassment, and raped. All this while her boyfriend, an intelligent and well-intentioned lawyer, attempts to help her through her struggles.This is a very bad film.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when people start arriving from Stockholm to Cologne in the morning and there will be not enough time to walk back home after the train leaves. It was only two days earlier that an American couple had to turn back from London to get back to their hotel, as they didn't know how long the journey would take and were worried about having to stay overnight. When my father bought his first home, we took him up to see it.|0
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! ! ! ! ! it is too good for its own good , they are so talented that if they had any talent at all they would be better actors !!! i see a movie or two like this every year in my hometown of houston. it never seems to do well on the screen, because there aren't enough people here who care about it. some times we get a decent movie and then forget about it for weeks (this is one of those episodes).|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the dialogue had been deleted. The pacing was great, the plot was weak, and the acting was just about average.The story could have benefited from a lot more direction and focus. This is a good example of a Hollywood ""movie"" that is made up of very bad movies. I'm not saying any of them are all bad, but some are far worse. In the beginning, they try to explain away the events of the movie by telling a fictional character that he killed his brother."|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) I had no idea it would bring me so much love. I am not sure if this is a bad thing, or if its just that these two movies are very close and you should watch them in order. That being said, they have one of the best looking and most impressive characters in all of horror. When the story started I didn't see too much hope for the plot and I was really surprised how good the acting was.|0
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store and all i remember is how crazy it was to sit there in the audience on a Saturday night and hear that they would be showing this movie ! the whole thing was too much of a nightmare for me and i just couldn't bear the thought of watching it over and over again!!! A great movie but I'm still not happy with it. The main female characters are all pretty boring and have little to no personality except for one.|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , but this movie is awful . It is also very bad acting on both sides, which makes it rather depressing.The story line is really annoying. My only problem was that the characters had nothing to offer in the way of a plot or anything. You have to love Hollywood because you can get virtually anything when you go to them! This movie was just too much for me to handle. The first half hour was totally wasted with such blatant crassness and cheap acting by the actors and actresses.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I really liked the concept of what was going to happen. I have always felt that the worst way to bring a film to market is to waste everyone's time by showing nothing at all. I didn't expect much from this movie. It was a bit of a missed opportunity. I was disappointed that the filmmakers chose not to include any kind of plot twist or character development in the beginning. I think they had better ideas in mind with this one.|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty and Albert were in love for a long time. They married and had two children of theirs. So when they both died young, they left their only remaining child behind. And there was no one to take her place. I always found this story interesting, but I am really curious as to how it ended. I would love to tell you what actually happened though, but I know it must be rather difficult to understand what happened.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I'd seen it with my own eyes, by myself, and as a child I didn't quite comprehend how such a film was possible. But once I got the chance to watch the movie again, I realized just how amazing it was. I thought that this could never happen, and if it had I don't think I would've even been able to write this review...|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , great score and good music. If you love the old days of cinema then you need to go see this gem, it's absolutely gorgeous! It is an amazing movie. I was so excited when I finally got my copy. I went to get a copy early because I needed to watch the first one in case I had to buy another. When I opened the box I couldn't believe I got two copies. I bought them for $25.00 each.|0
"Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's classic and, even though the film has some plot holes, it does a fantastic job. There's an underlying theme that seems to hang over all this, one that isn't explored much in this otherwise excellent biopic: How do you deal with someone who's always saying, ""It's wrong""? ""We did not know how to shoot a movie until we had finished filming our script, which was a lot of work. It was very emotional."|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up-and-Coming'' novel, with the result that even the most loyal viewers can find themselves in a state of semi-apoplexy by the beginning of the sixth act. In such a case, this book should have been expected to be a success. Instead, it's become a failure. I've seen people criticize the movie because they couldn't make sense of the prose and how it was not only incomprehensible to them, but unscripted as well.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the entire genre as well. It does not disappoint in any way, shape or form when it comes to comedy and I was looking forward to seeing just a little bit more of his work. I actually found this film very hard to review. I thought it would be much better on DVD, but alas, I got the DVD version anyway. To be perfectly honest, I went into this expecting to like this film, and I do have some respect for the people who did make it.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's about to be taken to prison. They must flee in an air freight truck . This movie is NOT for children or anyone under the age of 25! You should take a break from your computer while you look at these silly idiots trying their damnedest to make me laugh out loud. The last few scenes are really funny and the film itself is entertaining but don't let that scare you into thinking it has anything going for it.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in the 1930ÔøΩ40s.The film is not based on reality or history, it's fiction. I did not really find anything interesting about it. For example, why would all the young people from Italy stay in the same class? It does not seem logical. My wife and I went to Norway to visit my dad who had passed away a few months prior and he wanted us to have some fun. I think most movie buffs agree that movies make us laugh and that's what we want to see in our lives.|0
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , there would be some attempt at a horror film, but I had a hard time believing that it could ever be made. When I heard that the French producers of the film intended to make it, I knew this was one of those films which will never come out of the French film industry.The script is as bad as it looks. We see an ordinary couple going out for a nice picnic when they find themselves suddenly attacked by two men dressed in ski masks.|0
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a big fan of this movie (I think it was okay), but it was funny enough and it had a good storyline to give the audience hope after watching the first 2 hours. In fact, I found myself rewatching the entire thing at least once, just to keep myself entertained. I saw this film in theatre on Saturday evening. My friends and I sat at one side of the cinema looking bored. At that moment I heard the familiar clack of a chainsaw across the floor.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just watched this episode and left the house you would have gotten a great laugh out of being a dad .The script was funny in its simplicity but it always felt like something was missing for the audience. I have seen a number of these over the last 10 years and they never quite seem to stick with me or make me actually watch them. They do, however, have a very unique quality about them that can be really appreciated.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have much going on but it 's certainly one of Herzog's best works ever. There 's no question about that . It has all the elements of a true masterpiece , which makes you want to sit down at your favourite cinema and watch it.The only real problem with this film (other than its questionable direction) is the plotline. The movie plays out as if it was scripted by someone who doesn' t even understand English (it can be hard to imagine such an illiterate director making a good movie).|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes ever put on screen. I watched it for the last two seasons, and just about every season in between (in fact most of its run) I can only imagine the lengths some people went to to to see it. There are three main characters in this story, each one trying to bring their lives back together after a traumatic death. This is an amazing film that should be studied by everyone who watches horror, or any type of dramatic event.|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student body of a South African University.The director of this film has no idea what he is doing . I was really hoping this movie would be something special, but sadly I was disappointed with it. The plot wasn't much, but the acting was... OK! But not great either. The rest of the movie could have easily made it onto my list of 'must watch's' (although it was too long).|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an absolute gem. All the scenes are amazing in every possible way. One of the worst was the first time I saw it, when there was no one else in the room. The scene where they were all trying to take out the baby and her mother? You could hardly see any of them. What's so special about this film is that nobody knows who made it. This must have been done at the studio or something like that..I'm not making this up!|0
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . I am a big fan of westerns , and I've seen a few Westerns, but not enough to say they are superior to any other genre in any way. And I guess I should point out that there are plenty of great movies in both genres, but I have heard so little about them that I thought I would write these words for you. The most annoying thing about all this is the fact that there's nothing good about it.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son ¬ñ Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch an audience of teenagers. If you're the kind who would rather watch a porn scene than go to bed at night with what looks like real blood all over your clothes, I can only conclude that this film is not for you. The sex scenes in this movie are very boring - they just don't feel realistic. The characters in this movie are nothing special - there are no good-looking teen actors or other memorable personalities. In fact, these characters are completely devoid of any emotion.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of Russian chess masters in 18th-century England who have to race to prove their skills. It doesn't get much worse, does it? But it gets progressively worse! I saw 'Chess Fever', a very low budget film with almost nothing to it (except apparently an awful theme song) and some really lame jokes which I think were designed to make me laugh. The script by Alan Ritchson was atrocious from the start - he didn't even seem to know where he was heading!|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The boss of his company has recently passed away, and Mr. Norton hires him to investigate the mysterious deaths of his son and daughter. I think this film is one of those films that could have been worse. The story is just plain silly. They couldn't even come up with anything else to do with it besides make me laugh. Even though there was something funny going on in the movie, its just not funny or enjoyable.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully unfunny movie. I can tell because every time I watch, there's always something amusing going on. Every time I've seen this movie for the first time I've laughed out loud. In one scene, we get to see what everyone in the world thinks of each other. It's almost like they all look at each other and try to think of funny things they could say. A very interesting movie about how our society affects our relationships with each other.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and an amazing achievement to make a film about something so important . The producers are well versed in making movies that capture life, but they've done such a great job with this one. It captures the beauty of what life is and how hard people fight against it. It is not only a beautiful thing, but a great example of humanity. What you see in this movie is no different from what I saw in real life after I went through some horrible experiences in my youth.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (in the movie, of course!) was to get us into the back of the train so we could watch movies on the floor. I watched this a year and a half ago and fell asleep every couple of minutes. This movie is very overblown and there are two things that bother me about this movie. Firstly, the plot line is ridiculous. There is no way it would be believable that three girls from the middle class can get away with such nonsense.|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie itself, which I watched in the theater on TV. But I thought that this movie did a good job of depicting what it would be like to fall in love. The film had all the hallmarks of a typical Hollywood sci-fi or fantasy movie with some cool twists thrown in. There were some plot points that seemed out of place. For example, why didn't we meet her father/sister? What kind of relationship was between his wife and daughter? Why weren't they together?|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the Woods, which is really good, and that movie wasn't even funny at times. I didn't expect to like a movie about two people having sex. I watched it for the first time on TV. It was kind of boring. I don't remember the ending. I just saw This Is Your Life! I can't tell you how often I watch an episode of A-Team so I'm going to guess it's a couple of times per year.|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) with the exception of one particular scene where they make out. I have to agree with my fellow reviewers, this movie has a lot of charm. It's entertaining from start to finish. One must watch it for yourself. It's about an old married couple who raise their children in a quiet village in the country called Madurai. Their only means to get along is to stay away from people. But when something big happens, the two are forced to confront each other face to face.|0
"Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? Maybe it's too late to catch them all now but don't be afraid to enjoy some of your favourite classics in the past and see if they have changed your life.There is no other way to describe this movie. If you are looking for a bad movie then try ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame"". But if you want to see something more epic, or at least scary like ""The Dark Knight Returns"" then check out ""Titanic""."|0
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very interesting and entertaining plot line. It may be one of the most boring and stupidly stereotypical films that I've seen in some time, but even if I had to do it all over again I would say its pretty good fun. There's a movie for every style and level of film buff, no matter how hard your eye might be willing to adjust to it. If you're looking for an action/horror flick for your summer, this is not it.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century. And then I heard from someone in the comments thread that it was one of those things that would be impossible to watch at home, but somehow make for a great film if you have a decent TV! I had no clue what to expect from this one, except that it is absolutely breathtaking. This is a true gem, but I must say it has a few rough spots. In terms of cinematography, there are some problems.|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy (Sofia Boutella ) to transport them to an island in the Pacific. The film starts off very innocently enough. I think the director intended for it to be a bit light-hearted; I just had trouble keeping interest. What he didn't want to do was make this movie about Mormonism, or even have any sort of negative connotations at all. The problem was, the characters are so overused that you wonder why they're there at all.|0
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 80s. It had little to do with me or my friends. Well, this film has been a total waste of my time over the years. I don't even really like movies that have no idea how they came about. This one did not. You get a guy (Robert De Niro) trying to convince his friend (George Hamilton) that he should marry her (Mandy Moore) because he can't stand her.|0
"There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Battle of Iwo Jima . It was the only American film made before World War II that took on such an important political, social, and religious context. It was also very expensive: $25 million to $30 million plus extras. The first thing I noticed when I saw it back in 1981 was that I couldn't get enough of Robert Duvall's voice. There wasn't much else he did, but duvall did do other things that you might call ""dishonorable."""|0
"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and it showed people in a good light - the main characters were all really good. This one wasn't so great though - there were only 2 scenes in the whole movie. When I was growing up in the early 60's we used to go to movies at least once a month. I remember the first time I ever heard of ""Crazy Mary"" or ""Wacky Mary"". We sat through most of them just laughing out loud."|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great direction and an amazing cast. As I mentioned before, this movie is about a family on the brink of divorce. But when a man's mother refuses to give up her house and money, there is no way he can leave. To save his life, the only thing he can do is stay put and watch his young sister go crazy. As they wait, things go awry between their two sons.|0
"I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , and the English subtitles suck)


The story is quite good, and the acting is wonderful. However, the whole film is filled with plot holes that can not be solved. It was very obvious that I was watching another movie when all of the plot holes became obvious. The ending is rather lame too. If I could give it an A- this would have been my choice for a favourite film.This is one of those films that you are never going to get off your hands."|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in existence and I've been using it for a while to play online games. And I have to say that I enjoyed the whole thing, but it's the graphics that really killed this game. The music is terrible (not even my wife could understand most of it), all the characters look awful, and most of the scenery is bad. First off , i don't know if you are aware of this, but the title of this game has been given to many other titles.|0
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following an innocent man as he moves into an old, decrepit trailer park and attempts to solve crimes by solving mysteries with clues found in the dirt. The plots are convoluted, but I'm pretty sure we'll still be talking about them for weeks to come. I am not a big horror film fan, i don't watch any new horror flicks anymore so I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was when I saw this one.|0
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure. While some of the action scenes are intense and exciting, the story is a non-glorious one. In fact, its main thrust is to glorify its hero instead of convey the truth of his crime. I don't think this is a very good movie or at least something that I would watch in my home with my friends. The acting is rather poor in all the dialogues. The dialogue in general is really boring and uninteresting. The plot is poorly conceived.|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this game, as there is nothing wrong with it and every aspect works flawlessly. There are some problems, but the biggest issue is the difficulty. It's not like you're dealing with a bunch of stupid kids who can't learn from their mistakes (this is an adults game!). The graphics are horrible, the puzzles are very simple and un-fun, and the dialogue is cheesy and pretentious. This game just makes me cringe.|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford was ever able to write. In fact, this is about as good as it gets. The first 20 minutes will have you thinking twice about getting on with watching this one. It's not bad by any means, but I just felt it was going to be a little too predictable. And then, like a dying whale, it all starts up again. First off, this movie has no plot whatsoever.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a very dark and depressing piece of work ,and if you're not familiar with the genre you should take a look before viewing. If you already know the genre, then this film will have you laughing so hard you'll probably wish you had never seen this movie. This isn't supposed to be scary at all. The story doesn't get much better in terms of plot line than this. It has some decent acting, it has some good camera work, and it definitely has some fun action sequences.|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the worst. The actors don't have any real depth in their characters. Their acting and direction are all flat and lifeless.The only redeeming quality to this movie is the creepy atmosphere. It's not a bad movie, it's a bad film. It's funny how most horror movies start as great ideas, then fall apart. This is no different. First off: they were terrible. They're nothing like that now.|0
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series we just watched until the very end. That being said, this movie is pretty interesting and has a good plot twist! I thought there was some potential for this movie to be entertaining. The story is well done and the actors (Johannes Kieslof) did an awesome job at portraying characters. There were several scenes that would've made for a good episode if not for the CGI. For those that haven't seen this movie, they are going to like it.|0
"King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , the director David O. Selznick is absolutely brilliant and there are so many wonderful actors on this movie. The title implies that this movie should have been called ""Godfather of Sex."" You can't make a movie like this without sex, drugs and rock'n'roll! There is no doubt it was created by an evil mobster (Robert De Niro) to be a money-making video for himself which he then used to pay off his debts to the mobsters."|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making movies in spite of the family tragedy. Then, one day, the camera shows him watching a TV show about a married couple having an affair and is shocked to realize that this is the real thing . He tries to figure it out on his own by going to a party with his friends, but ends up being captured!The film doesn't get off the ground until the end, where we find out that all the couples involved are lying... and the movie ends badly.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But it never actually gets into rabbit season! It is so bad, it can make you want to get off the couch and sit on the floor next to an air conditioner. I remember watching a movie which was made by this film school professor, who had his hands full with dealing with students at the University of Florida. A friend of mine got hooked on this movie and went ahead and rented it through Vudu, but unfortunately, we couldn't see it.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
"Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? My wife and I are huge fans of the movie Saved By The Bell, but as a child we couldn't understand why anyone would ever do such a stupid thing. When our son was growing up at school, his teacher told us ""Don't listen to that girl on television. She's really bad."" But when we went back to the library for more info, we found this information. And it wasn't the best explanation possible!"|0
"After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as sexually adventurous as men in Hollywood. I was so impressed with the first two films that my friend took me to see both and I loved every second of it. Then, she told me about a film made by a man named Peter Fonda that was very similar. My friend laughed and asked if he'd ever heard of this thing called ''The War of The Roses''. When I said ""Yes"", she exclaimed, ""I think you may have found it!"|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
"This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . The plot is so unbelievable , its hard to believe that it's real . There are too many things going on there , the only thing that keeps this movie from being a good movie. I hope someone else can come up with an idea of what could have brought this one together
If you like movies about sex and violence, don't miss this one. As a pornographer and performer, I was intrigued by the characters, the story line, and the storyline itself."|0
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagree¬óthis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling¬óit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in France. The play was based around the story of a young girl whose father kills herself by cutting himself with an axe and her father's blood is taken for a cure to the deadly plague. This was not the most original idea ever, but I loved it nonetheless. I just got back from England where I have just spent several weeks living out of a car, traveling up and down London, and finally hitting the big one.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the 5th and 6th ones, which i have to admit i was really curious about ). I can only assume that it is not meant to be a serious drama but a comedy or whatever? I don't know. But I'm still interested in hearing some other opinions on this movie because I am sure there are some people who thought this film wasn't funny enough. I'm not going to tell you what to do with your mind when you just watched this flick.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , it was scary , and it was really good ! I love horror movies, so I must say that this was one of my favorites! This is not your average movie. This is a truly awful movie. If you're in need of some sort of PG rated horror movie then this may not be for you. For starters, what is the plot of this thing? A bunch of people go to their house and see something that causes them pain and death.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to make more. I believe this was an attempt to keep production costs down, but it worked only because Ford would never be able to finish a film. Although the `Big' (the first movie in the genre) is one of the worst films of the period, I think it is a very entertaining piece of work. The story is quite simple, there are no twists or surprises, yet it is suspenseful, interesting and emotionally charged.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
"`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone looked up at the camera and said ""I just want to take a picture."" But that's not what happened. I was in the back seat, my girlfriend sitting next to me saying ""I don't think we can do this movie anymore"". We didn't know if there was any light at the end of tunnel. It seemed like the whole place had fallen apart. I love this story."|0
"Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has always had a knack for turning his material into an interesting film that is entertaining to watch. I have to say, this was the first of these I've seen. It starts off with two thugs who decide to rob a bank while they're walking around and get away with what they did. Then there's a character named ""Jack Frost"" who takes them out to a diner and makes a beeline for Jack Frost's house."|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinematic expression ever since he first started making movies in Germany in the late 1970s, and his directorial talent is just beginning to come into its full realization. His debut feature, The Great Escape (1975), won a prestigious BAFTA, followed shortly thereafter by Die Walk√ºre (1980) and The Killing Fields (1983). He worked on many more films, none of which came close to winning the prize for best picture at Cannes, but that's about where they stop.|0
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and his scenes are so good they're worth watching the whole time. I really enjoyed this movie ! I think this movie might have been a better alternative to The Dark Knight 2. There is far less gore in this movie; but it also doesn't look as good as the other two (the sequel, of course) movies. That being said, I find this one to be more satisfying. The acting was okay, and the writing was not very good.|0
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few good ones) need to be replaced. There are so many amazing episodes here that I don't think any of them were created by an outside writer - the writers simply made all these great characters work. If they could have done anything else for it, they would have improved it, not ruined it for me. This is actually one of the more entertaining shows I have watched recently. The story is really interesting and doesn't take itself too seriously.|0
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this movie with high expectations, not knowing that it would only be the 2nd or 3rd time i'd seen something like this, and I can't believe it didn't disappoint. The story starts as a kid in his parents' basement finds a package on his porch. In the package he finds a piece of paper stating he is supposed to go to visit an old lady who was very ill and wanted him to take care of her.|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
