Without a doubt , the biggest waste of film of the year . This movie is poorly structured , sadistic , uninteresting , boring , and , at times, extremely boring . And this is only the first of three films that make this year an absolute waste . The only real redeeming feature in all of these films is that the acting is generally bad . It's good to see an actor who's good and has talent , but in this particular case , this is just a way to keep the budget down . This movie should have taken at least 2 to 3 times the amount of money to make it good .|0
I did have some expectations from this film because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star(??!) cast was new. Well, I must tell u that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that).|1
Right... so you have a dam, tons of water (that seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens to be right underneath the dams path of destruction. Throw in a profiteering glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting. All in all, when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view... I would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay-per-view film. If you want a laugh... then you really need to watch this film.|1
It is n't TOO bad , but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between , the songs are generic , the acting is the worst i've seen and the special effects are rubbish , i don't think it will get any better. I don't even like American television, but I can not watch this show because the plot is so stupid. The plot is that three people in their 40's meet at a diner and decide to try to have an orgy. They meet at a place where people don't go.|0
"This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round"" theater."|1
I did n't understand the people who rated it over 5 . I think it 's a horrible film from start to finish. The way it's shot and the way the story is told, it makes me feel like I don't want to see any film. But if you can overlook that it has a lot of great scenes, great actors, a good plot. I recommend it, but only for those who are looking for a fun film that isn't too deep. I'll try to keep my review to that.|0
This is a movie that deserves another look -- if you have n't seen it for a while , or if you want to re-examine it for whatever reason, go for it, but do so with an open mind, and if you do, please also consider that there are a bunch of things here that I probably don't understand. If you've read my other posts about this movie, I'm not sure you can tell much difference in the way I see it, but there are a bunch of other people out there who see something entirely different.|0
"There is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: ""In Italy it's the dead who rule"". True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. But foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed."|1
"'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it 's not possible to become one with something that is not alive, is not part of the world, that is not part of me,' he said, referring to himself in the third person. 'The only way of being one with something is by living it, by sharing it, by being part of it'."" ""The only way for me to be one with my own self is to let the self become one with something else."|0
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie . Well , it is a great movie , and for the rest of this review I am going to tell you the whole story of why I thought it was a waste of time. In my opinion, this is a film that has very little to do with the events that unfolded in Dallas the other night and even less to say about how we should all act after what happened. But this is one of the few times in my entire life I have seen a movie so bad I could have actually cried for it.|0
I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.There were other problems.|1
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy's the man. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.|1
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls . It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her friends would come and play. It is a beautiful story, but the story was told as a movie rather than a song, which I find disappointing. However it is a great children’s movie that I would recommend to anyone, including grown ups. I love this movie, even though it is so short and it ends so soon. I had never seen the movie, but this was my first time ever to see this song.|0
It 's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia . Apart from very distinctive differences in features, the portraits show two different women. How to find the real princess? The real Anastasia had no brothers, sister or any family relations. Anna Anderson was born into the British royal family on May 15th, 1869, to the youngest of three children. The first of her siblings, Princess Alice was born on November 23rd, 1870. Her father was George III and mother Princess Alexandra of Denmark.|0
"In case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. That's pretty much the extent of the movie. Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and ""NYPD Blue's"" Jimmy Smits."|1
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable.|1
This is the Australian TV series . It is a classic . The stories and actors are excellent . Who is your favourite? Well I did like it a lot . The cast was good . I don't know who I would choose for a favourite but I liked them all . How can you describe the plot? I liked it . I think it was a bit slow . I thought there was a lot of plot going on but there wasn't really enough . It did get boring towards the end . I liked it but I think it had a lot of faults .|0
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb.|1
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career. I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD.|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films . I am looking for all his films to be available for viewing. I have been unable to locate the films myself on DVD and Blu Ray. The films I am looking for should have been made with HD and I want all his films to be available. Please let me know if you have any of my films available to be viewed and please respond to my e-mail. I will need all of his films and not just some. Thanks for any help you can give me I have been trying to search for the films but without any luck.|0
"This really is by far the worst movie I 've ever seen in my whole life ( I 'm approaching 10, but I don't think this is going to count). I have watched it twice, in theaters and online and would like to never go to see it again unless it comes out on DVD. I know that most of the review will probably be about how bad the film is, but I 'm more concerned with why I 'm so much against the film . So here it goes:

THE FILM: It is hard to believe that this movie actually was made."|0
Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. This is one of those films. Of course I can't help that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. I suppose we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot.|1
"In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short, we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed ""Serpentine Dance"" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era."|1
First of all , I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Campbell’s work. I think he was one of the most profound thinkers in my lifetime and his theories and writings on the importance of symbolism and symbols are one of my favourite subjects in film criticism. Also, for a film with a central theme that focuses on the importance of a symbol, the significance of a totem, the importance of symbols in our life and the meaning of dreams and symbolism in our lives is important.|0
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame American monster flick needs affordable SFX.|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars . Quite a statement. That’s because the scene is just about perfect and, if you think of it rationally, is the only thing that’s really interesting in the film. In the real life version of this movie, it might have been better to do something a little more conventional. In the TV version of The Killing (which I had not watched before I wrote this), the main story line is basically about the disappearance and presumed suicide of a wealthy and famous woman.|0
I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through.|1
It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover.|1
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that's the way it should be.But on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out.|1
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn.|1
During filming, was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon? It was like she was reading from an autocue. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. I read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface.|1
This film is absolutely appalling and awful . It 's not low budget , it 's a no budget film , it has been shot on the cheapest of cameras , the worst sound system ever built by man , the worst picture quality in movie history , the worst audio , the worst sound effects in movie history , its a terrible film , one of the worst ever made , but its worse than most, I say it is the worst ever made, but most of the time it is just bad , the worst film in the history of film .|0
Not good . Mostly because you do n't give a damn about what happens to all these people . Some of the worst and most tragic things happened on this earth when we did not give a damn. But you, like so many others, refuse to take any responsibility for what you did and you refuse to feel shame for it. You just can't face up to the reality of what is really happening. You are just going along with it all and hoping that nothing bad will happen. But there's a chance it will.|0
Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago the parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried.|1
"Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it 's not without trying and some interesting ideas but for a variety of reasons : 1. the plot is un-engaging or even a drag at times 2. it is over-long in spots and not nearly interesting enough in others 3. at times the writing just doesn't feel that compelling 4. the writing is too heavy handed at times 5. or is it just that the story just doesn't ""click"" so to speak and the ideas don't click with the characters ?"|0
It may be , although there are still two or three I 've missed . This film constructs an interesting situation for the director , with a little story , a little atmosphere , a good cast , and a few clever twists and turns . the film features , among others , the talented and engaging michael dorn ( as he is at the time ) , who gives a strong performance . dorn plays an insurance salesman who , after one too many too many accidents , gets out of the business , and takes up residence on a lonely stretch of coast road .|0
I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed.One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J.|1
This is a film by Oshima , the director of the notorious `` In The Realm Of The Senses '' ( 1989 ), about a young boy's encounter with his dead parents' ghost in a hospital where they were taken in an ambulance for surgery. It's an unusual film in that there's nothing particularly scary or supernatural going on. Instead, the ghost of his mother and father is an important character, and a kind of mentor figure to the young boy. The film seems to suggest that it's better to take your chances with a bad memory than to suffer a bad memory.|0
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It is VERY cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean I believe a guy I know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It is that bad. I noticed the name from whence this cameAsylumand I will NEVER rent anything with that name on it again!!!|1
"the worst sequel I 've ever seen . really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films were

By: Anonymous

I really enjoyed this series. I think the movie was very good for the most part. The music was excellent. It had some pretty good songs and the animation was very good as well. I think the problem with this movie was that it took the story and characters in the original movie and just didn't give them any more depth or development. It tried to keep up with the plotline but didn't know how to develop them anymore."|0
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their friendship , the humor and the sheer joy of being in the presence of actors and actresses who at least appear to know what they are doing. The acting is very good and the direction is excellent , even if the story was written by a man and a woman, so don't expect anything other than the standard Hollywood product. I will definitely recommend it , but I think it would work better for a female audience.|0
Well I 'm not the world 's biggest Sondheim fan , so although I have the cast album and I think it's worth a listen, it's only when you get to the end that you really get into him. But when you 're really in to it, he is just magic. I 've seen him several times in concert and he's simply one of the best interpreters around . . . in the history of musical theatre . . . of any kind. I 'd love to see him play a musical I wrote myself, and I 'd also love to see him perform his songs on Broadway .|0
I would not recommend it whatsoever. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except The two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did smack of Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers.|1
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre : setting it in the Old West. In fact, it's a remake of an old movie about a zombie apocalypse. It also promised to have an American hero. The first thing that you'll notice is that the film has no American protagonist. There's a British character (played by Sam Worthington) but, by and large, most of the characters are foreigners. They come from different backgrounds. One character is from England and speaks with a British accent (that of a young John Cleese).|0
I cant believe it ! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a bad attitude. It's still an enjoyable and interesting watch. Jim is a fun guy to watch, but you really get to know what the heck he thinks and feels. And it's great to see that he still can have some bad days as a character and still be a kick-ass man. And it's still a good action flick, with some good fight scenes and good camera work from the cast, including Jim.|0
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan. Now I am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. The four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after Vietnam.|1
'The 4th Floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a lot of attitude who is forced to become a babysitter to her boss' children after he goes off on a business trip in New York. This movie, with a running time of nearly two hours, is probably the worst I have seen so far this year. The story is fairly thin, and has a running time far too short to properly explore the characters or to explore the setting. While it is set in New York, it is entirely shot in the style of Los Angeles.|0
"For me, this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles based ""Z"" Channel when it was in service. And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one I did not want to accept.Moving to Los Angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the ""Z"" Channel in its showing of international films."|1
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on the eastern front. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wishing for the next. Pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialog. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time.|1
I found it hard to care about these characters , who were either annoying or insipid , all living their own lives , I just couldn't understand the reason for this plot , I can't say that I didn't enjoy it . However I must say that I did quite enjoy the last few episodes of the season , and even more so the ending of it all . It is the beginning of a new series , but with the new characters the show will have a chance to grow into something else . I hope it will , because right now all we've got is a formula show that is boring .|0
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating , the pace in the movie was so fast , it felt like the story was so slow . I watched it anyway and was surprised , the pace was really great , I would rate the movie 8.5/10. The only complaint I had was the storyline was a little bit unbelievable , for example , the scene in which the main character met his wife on the beach while on a date was quite funny and the next scene was a little weird and unrealistic .|0
`` Garden State '' is another of these `` indie '' -type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the big bucks. But, in reality, there's no way that you can find in the history of the movie business that anyone could have ever spent $10 million making something like Garden State. It's about as big and bold as a $5,000 can of beer. I mean, it's got a good soundtrack, a decent plot, some decent acting - and then there's the scene where the guy and girl hook up.|0
I do n't know what it is exactly , but the film is happily sitting on my shelf , with n't on top of it for some time to come ! The film is about a woman who returns to her childhood village because the son she had with her childhood sweetheart years ago has returned. When she returns, she discovers an old house that is full of secrets. One of the secrets is that her father's family is in fact from England , but her family did not want to tell her. Instead they decided to keep the secret so as to protect the family.|0
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life . To know that you have seen it and now can't stop looking at it just goes to show how wrong the British film-maker who created this film is for the horror audience . The movie is very slow in parts and there are several scenes of extreme violence but it's still very shocking to see some of the graphic violence that is present in these scenes . It's not enough to make me sick , I have seen some sick horror movies in my time but this is the worst and most disturbing of the bunch .|0
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexualsand I haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell.Yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place.|1
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie . Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies . The acting is so bad you can really see it . The script is pretty crap and I dont think they will be doing another one ever . The story is one I hear a lot from a lot of the people that go see this shit . I have no idea what the movie is about , but the acting and script are not worth the money . What can I say, I'm really happy I found this site, this is my first comment and my first time posting a comment .|0
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field!|1
"I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out . I recall the scariest scene was when the character played by Jack Nicholson is driving to a gas station to get a beer. At the end of the movie , we see his car drive away and he doesn't see the girl that he was going to get the beer with. At the time, I thought that meant that the woman he was going to be with would get killed. That is one scary scene . The movie was called ""Poker Face."""|0
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film . It is full of great action scenes , which are exciting . But the whole movie is dull , boring and uninteresting . I don't know what it is . I feel that this movie will be boring , I don't think this movie will entertain me . I really feel this movie to be un-entertaining for all . The script is not very good . The movie will not be great . I can see the story and the script and the action , but it is too slow. The cinematography is also very bad.|0
This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through . After the introduction , the film starts with a brief history of Nazi Germany . It then goes into the story of two young Americans who work in an office for Hitler's SA . I did not know what the SA did, but as I have said before , it seemed like it would be something very bad . The first two acts were very boring , which is probably why the rest of it was boring . When they come back to America , they work with the Allies .|0
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight.|1
Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made `` Bamako , '' but the rest of the continent, including the West, may not. The first two-dozen words of the movie, which premiered in Paris on Tuesday, are a description of a country in the throes of political and economic upheaval: `` Africa is in the grip of war. '' When the movie opened here, Sissako himself, dressed in a blue track suit and a black baseball cap, looked every bit the fighter, standing on the red carpet beside his wife and his brother, who have both played roles in his career.|0
"If you thought NBC 's 10.5 was stupid , you 'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the deep end of television for a ""reality"" TV that 's actually a hybrid of reality TV and scripted series. In the world of reality TV, there 's always one thing everyone can agree on: That there is no one single best reality TV show, and no one single type of show. So it was with ""Project Runway All Stars"", the first reality TV series of its kind, and one of the most well-received series of the fall."|0
this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. On the other hand, if you are a die hard Jim Varney/Ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. It does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between.|1
Ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. The movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. Do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby. The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a pair.|1
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie...but it isn't Pinhead, he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird, and the worse...he talk too much.|1
"I am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of crap. I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it. I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.There was no credit for who did the voice of ""The Dark One"". Sounded a bit like Patrick Stewart at times.A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that."|1
"""Christmas in Connecticut"" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's ""perfect farm"" for the Christmas holiday."|1
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the dark , mysterious back streets of Toronto, Ontario. This is a tale of two worlds. On one side is your average everyday Joe, and the other is the underworld. It will take a little bit of an explanation to make this whole thing real, but we’re going to do our best to get you up to speed. As most of you will know, there are those in Toronto who have made their choice for the worse.|0
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron , famous lovers of their time in the United States of the 19th century ? March was a pioneer of cinema in France and later a film director, writer, producer, and an actor. He was one of the first directors who worked for the studios and directed more than 100 films for the most renowned French studios. During that time, March created many memorable movies. His most famous is probably The Tenant (1934) and its sequel Le Cri du petit homme.|0
Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it is in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.Next, it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors.|1
"This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that it has the cliché ""You really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story"" routine dragged out for a while."|1
This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet , Mishima . It jumps around a lot in time and places. In one place, it is at night in the forest . In another, it was the night of his murder. It is a film that explores the darkness within us and also the darkness of nature. This film gives us a real look at how people live on the outside without having to think about what it means to be alive or dead. There is no judgement, no blame, no evil, just love.|0
"This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there's way too much ""plot"", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct."|1
I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc.|1
Im warning you people out there , this is just a waste of your time . I am being honest , you have to take my word for it . I dont care about this stuff , I have been on the site for several years . They do this all the time . They are like vultures , sucking on your soul . You know you are being lied to , but do you want someone to come after you ? Of course not , that is why you are being ripped off , because you dont know who they are . So dont fall for the lies .|0
And obviously I did n't see it ! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back we'll see what that's all about. I hope that he will bring some excitement to the role he has. There have been a few others I'd like to see in an action movie. This guy may be the one ! I'll be surprised if he does not , because he can act and be believable as a man . Yes, he's been around the block, and he is a good actor. He will bring some energy into a movie.|0
This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as The Robe , Quo Vadis (in which a priest is played by Peter Sellers and the movie's plot is a commentary on the story of the Holy Grail) and The Man Who Couldn't Say No (1956), have been adapted for screen. This film was written by Philip Kaufman, produced by Jerry Juhl and directed by Robert Stevenson. It was filmed in New York City in 1957 and on location in Ireland and on a soundstage at Universal Studios.|0
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. He hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure by a long shot. You can't tell that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow-motion, though.|1
Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious.|1
This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing.|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. He is often alone and used to it. He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters who speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is.|1
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie , Eddie Monroe . I have not seen it since I bought it but it still holds up very well. This is one of those movies that has a lot going on and as much as I wanted to love it I just did not have the stomach for it. I was not bothered by the fact that it featured a black man as the main character. He was in a lot of scenes but there was so many that he did not feature that I could have done without.|0
A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others . It 's a horse racing movie , and it 's a racing movie . I 'm glad to have seen it , because it is a very different horse racing movie than any I have seen yet , but also a very good one . You may not like it , you may hate it . You will enjoy it . And if you like racing as much as I do , then you will love it . The movie is a great mixture of comedy , tragedy , drama , drama , action , suspense , drama , and even drama .|0
"Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS ""event"". There's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring bland by-the-book TV drama clichés. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. What kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot."|1
"In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called ""stickers"". TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting."|1
Okay they tell you it's real. They don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - It's not real in the way you were hoping for. The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). Therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage.|1
This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. Straight from the coke-filled gutters of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene.How so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?Get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job.|1
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor . Geena Davis is a schoolteacher in New York. One day she meets a man at a party. He is funny and charismatic. She falls hard and starts spending her free time at his place. They meet often. Their relationship grows and she begins to notice he has a strange habit of sleeping with her father. One night he asks her if he may sleep with her. Geena accepts and they begin to have sex. Geena soon discovers she is pregnant and she has to decide what to do.|0
Please...if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it... do not waste your time!!!! I too watched this film right after finishing the book, and was seriously disappointed... the main character is basically a new made up Fanny, for she shows NO resemblance whatso ever to the book...she's so lively and laughing all the time... if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy, introverted character.... please!!!!!|1
This is probably Wayne 's poorest movie ; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role . This is the film that I think most of us were waiting for , but for different reasons . I didn't really understand what the fuss was all about at first , as it was only just beginning to take on life . But I soon saw why I should have seen it before I did , and I think I still like it a little , despite being a little bit let down . I just think it's an excellent film that has had it's ups and downs .|0
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all of that... This film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential.|1
Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.Yea, basically that's the short of it. There's more to it than that, but I still have no clue what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English.|1
"the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie . the girls were lame and pathetic , i really wish the boys made a comeback and got a few good movies with them . the girls were the best part of the movie but i didn't like the story or the acting and i thought the acting was lame as well and the storyline was lame

i was bored by it and i wanted to see it on a bigger screen . but the only problem was i couldn't . it had a limited screen so i watched it for only 15 minutes then put it back ."|0
"This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. ""THE HOLLOW"" is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either."|1
"The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. It is obviously much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. As long as the material's right.The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D"" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage."|1
Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I had n't known that I would have thought he made it up! I thought he was gonna make me watch the movie but he turned out to be surprisingly entertaining! It's just a weird plot, a weird concept and I found it oddly compelling. I don't want to give anything away other than that there's a love triangle at the beginning and it develops into a story of a man who comes home to discover that the wife of his dead friend has returned.|0
"A couple of clarifying comments are in order . Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of the documentary “Citizenfour” , and has asked for the video not be released. She is right to ask, and I agree that this is something that should be kept secret for now. Here is an excerpt of my response:

I don’t want this film to be a public relations exercise. I want people to have access to this information, because I want people to know what it is, how to use it in their own communities."|0
Oppenheimer was a GREAT series ( it was the first thing I saw Waterston in ) and it is too bad he is not still with the team, he might be one of the first to see the writing on the wall and that is the end of an era, but I am sure the team wants to keep him around for another year or two, at least to help ease his transition and allow him to get to a more important level, and that might be true, I have not heard anything to the contrary but who knows maybe the team wants him around for more than another year or 2.|0
Before we start , may I say I hope you 've already eaten when you 're reading this . Why? . Because it would make you a little crazy to think that I could have already written this and that I still need to do some more on the topic . It's true, after all, that we are talking about the food industry, but also about how we eat, about the food and drink we put into ourselves and about the choices we make when buying and eating those things . It could be any other food product and we'd all agree it's worth thinking about.|0
In watching this off and on for a few seasons , two things come to mind : One - wondering about the future, about the fate of this program. And two - watching the same guy do everything at once in his life and career. There are many things that one could say about him. That he's just like a coach, but that's not what I mean. I feel like one could say that he's the epitomy of a multi-dimensional coach. He's not a typical coach and never will be. He's got his strengths, and he's got his weakness's.|0
"I've lost count of the times I have seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it. The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. The characters, especially ""Nitro"", ""Sonar"" and ""Stepanik"" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast. I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out."|1
Back in the 70's, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.We begin in an isolated insane asylum.|1
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they have it was not the book they adapted, so they probably didn't know who wrote it, much less who wrote it well, so I don't think they'd know what to do. I also doubt whether they'd have the confidence to put in a scene that's supposed to make people uncomfortable but which actually has the effect of making them think about a book they know very well, and a book they know even better. I think they'd want to write something that wasn't about the book.|0
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies.|1
Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance.The film begins with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism.|1
"This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy , just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one didn't let me down at all

I'm sorry but this movie is not up to snuff and the only reason I gave this five stars is because of its cute story but I've seen a lot of movies like this where the story is so sweet that it ruins the fun but this wasn't that case and it was such a good movie that it made me want to watch another movie with it

I'm sorry but this movie was not worth your time at all."|0
`` The Dresser '' is perhaps the most refined of backstage films . The film is brimming with wit and charm. This is a real treat, especially for people with no familiarity with musical theatre. It was made as a vehicle for Mary Martin, who won a Tony Award for her performance, and the performance is spectacular . It is the only film in which all the cast sing in musical style, and in this respect this is perhaps the greatest of all live performances. It also makes a fascinating study of the pressures of being a showman.|0
I saw Heaven 's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago . Tickets were sold in advance based on the idea that the tickets would be snapped up almost instantly, but, in fact, it took a little longer than I'd hoped. In fact, more than three years later, I still don't have my ticket. So, here is my account of Heaven 's Gate 's first week at the Palace and what went on there in the days before it opened to the general public. I arrived on Friday morning just as the sun was going down.|0
BIG FAT LIAR , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . When you are looking at this movie from the perspective of someone who had a very strong religious upbringing , your eyes will be closed and you will probably have tears running down your face , because the film is so hard hitting , so heavy handed and so real . It is not easy to be made fun of as a teenager , especially as a young man in a new religious environment . I remember my mother telling me the same thing , when I was around 11 or 12 .|0
The submarine used was NOT Varangian ! 'It ' was in fact two boats , P614 and P615 , both of them being commissioned on 20 March 1940. They were not Varangians , but had been converted for service in the Russian navy in the Kola Bay area of the Baltic and Black Sea, respectively. P614 had been converted to a Type I submarine, but did not get this designation until after P614's launch. P615, by contrast, received the Type I name at the same time as P614 and thus became the first fully Russian-built Type I submarine in the Baltic fleet.|0
"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic! ), than the man alone...) and to link the ""adventures"" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying ""Oh, a boat!"") were awful."|1
"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing."|1
"I really tried to like ""Saw."" The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were too many clichés and elements that while they may have looked ""cool,"" they really made no sense.First, what I liked about the film was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife."|1
"I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these ""professionals"" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be."|1
"`` The Love Letter '' is a somewhat pleasant , very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of the letter ""l"" may be considered a running gag. ""Love is just a feeling, not a thing of reason. You have to have the heart and the love of your life to know if you have it or not. And in my book, I would say that the most important element to love is passion, not love. The love affair is just an adventure, not a romance."" ""This movie is a must see for any fan of romance."|0
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular Mst3k fodder usually contains. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer--sure, I'd watch it again.|1
Well , great costumes and a wonderful ` feel ' for Pre WWII Italy . But what happened here ? What is the truth about Italy’s World War Two (WWII) casualties ? How much did the Italian people pay in blood and treasure to defeat the Germans and their allies ? Why did many Italian soldiers go over to Nazi Germany in the summer of 1943 when Italy joined the alliance against Germany in September 1943 ? Why did some Italian soldiers remain faithful to the Axis side and fought with the Italians against the Allies ?|0
Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. It is full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand next to lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good.|1
It's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. These days it's shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC.It pains me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. It's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog.|1
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess.|1
Unfortunately a boring flick, and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is. The leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant, charming and sexy, forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with. The dame herself merely walks through the flick, being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute.|1
Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.Ever seen Pontypool?|1
Pilot Mitch MacAfee ( Jeff Morrow ) sees a UFO while test flying a plane -- but nothing shows up on radar. So MacAfee decides to keep the flight brief and to the side of other planes. Just as they are taking off for their test flight, something does show up on radar! A mysterious craft with no identification on its side appears from the south, flying directly overhead and heading straight for the plane. Then the unthinkable occurs. As the alien craft passes the aircraft on its way down, a loud noise is heard coming from within the craft -- a screeching noise as if from a dying engine.|0
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché . With character names such as ""The Big D"" , ""Slim Pickens"", ""Hellboy"" and ""Hangman"" . You expect a lot of violence . And not just a bit of it , a lot . Hell Ride is supposed to feature a lot of it . And the violence itself is more of what we're used to in films of this type than any other genre . And this is the story of how Hell Ride comes to be ."|0
I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting.|1
"This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 , starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor , Avery Schreiber as the Lieutenant , Steve Bartlett as a new guy called ""Ziggy "" and Steve Forrest as his best pal ""Joe."" You have to admit this was the most anticipated film for anyone who has been reading comic books for a number of months. The book ""Captain America"" was published in February 1979 and the first movie was in development at Warner Bros. as early as December 1978. They started filming in the last months of 1979 but it didn't go beyond principal photography in June of 1980 ."|0
Great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration.|1
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can't figure out which is worst; Norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.Visually the film does nothing for me.|1
Excerpt from TV GUIDE : This week on THE LOVE BOAT , Captain Stubing has his hands full when a young lady asks for his assistance with a matter. But the question is what does Stubing do when the young woman’s life is on the line? Excerpt from TV GUIDE : In this week’s edition of THE LOVE BOAT , Captain Stubing’s first time in New Orleans has him wondering if he can find his place in this world when it is not quite what he expected. However, it won’t be for a while.|0
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie ( Bella Martha/Mostly Martha ) , and everything that I have watched in the last two weeks of it, have been so good ,that I cant wait to start the 3rd movie. It is the 3rd book to a series of books that have been made into films. The series of books was released in the US in 2008 , and its first movie in 2009. The second movie was released in 2010. But I guess this movie doesnt need a third movie, at least I hope it wont be the same story as the previous two movies.|0
I never comment on a film , but I have to say that this was one of the worst films I have seen in quite a long time. The problem is that the film is a mess in all aspects of the production and that it is not even entertaining. The film opens with the main characters, a middle class couple, driving through the hills of the hills in their sports car. When they stop to rest the film cuts to a car accident and then the characters enter a hospital. We learn the couple has been to the doctor for some kind of health issue.|0
Was excited at the opening to hear part of `` Chevaliers De Sangreal '' but wanted more so I bought a copy for my wife and child who have never seen a Chevalier before in their lives. I hope that they are as excited at this time to learn more about the Order of the Sangreal as I was to finally see one. I hope that others will enjoy reading this as well. I will be glad to give a copy of the book to anybody that I know that has not already read it. Thank you for your kind words about my books.|0
well, what can i say. WHAT THE F**K? There really isn't much to say about this, really. The only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.ACTING- VERY UNCONVINCING! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Rip-off of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful!Gore- Really not believable. In one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story.|1
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm, son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up.|1
I usually seek to find good in movies , even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail . I would recommend you to not watch it , it is just bad . There are lots of movies like it on the net , don’t pay too much attention to bad movies because bad movies are going to be over , you know , there are so many good movies you might want to watch , then you know , it will be a great experience . But this movie is one where if you watch it you’ll feel a bit like , why is it bad ?|0
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan , loyal retainer Kogenta ( Jun Fujimaki ) is assigned by his master to lead a group of assassins to kill the head of the evil Samanosuke clan. However he finds himself at a crossroad between loyalty to his master and loyalty to the clan . When a young samurai Kogenta makes a deal with one of his childhood friends to help him out in his family’s attempt to restore their power , Kogenta discovers that the man he thought was a friend has betrayed him .|0
This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one . `` THE HOLLOW '' is a great Hercule Poirot thriller set in France in the late 1930s . It's about the mystery of the mystery woman. It's about the murder of a friend, a friend's death by poison. It's about Poirot, but it's not really his murder. And it's about the detective himself who, as usual, does all the heavy lifting . This is all well and fine, it's what Poirot and the detective do. It's the mystery story that Poirot does.|0
Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, Where's Daniel!? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. He could've helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute!|1
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last night to a couple hundred people, and it was wonderful to see how people's reactions changed as the film progressed. The first 15 seconds or so were pretty standard, but when things start to get a little heated up, it really took the crowd by storm - and it was a great way to close out the month. Thanks to all of you who came out! And if you'd like to see it again, you can see it in full in the video above.|0
"The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson 's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy meet a new, young Kermit the Frog in the guise of a college professor. ""You have to go to a party and get the wrong girl. And the wrong Kermit,"" the professor explains to the two Kermit (of course) at the start of The Muppets Take Manhattan, the first feature length film based on the muppet characters. ""You just can't say that."" Kermit protests. And Kermit is always right."|0
This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue.|1
The Quick and the Undead is , finally , the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. I’m talking about an event that occurred during production of The Dark Knight Rises (and probably The Avengers, but we’ll get to that later), when Christopher Nolan was asked what was going to happen at the beginning of the movie to set it up, and he answered, “I think we’ve been doing this for seven years now. We know what happened in the first film.|0
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table.|1
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film . For the most part the actors were good but there was no chemistry and there were lots and lots of close ups which ruined any chance for me to feel that the director was interested in creating a meaningful story. In hindsight I would have liked the characters to have been more complex and have been able to see what was happening to them. I could see what the main character's were up to and their motivations. As for the secondary characters, they were just a bunch of people who needed to know what the plot was about.|0
"""Jefferson in Paris"" is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way he was, the film seems to say. End of sentence, end of movie, the door's behind you.After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow)."|1
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want. I as a fan did not want a 1920's Evil Nazi movie. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, as we don't REALLY know what became of her. I also would have liked to get Ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing.|1
Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl!|1
An obvious cash-in on the *Insert Monster Here* On A Plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you'd expect it to be. The film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. Although, it is fun in parts, I must say. The Zombie-action is particularly entertaining. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel.|1
"Most people will consider that Yul Brynner 's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND ME (1963), but his performance was far better than the film's. To understand what makes him so remarkable, watch the film. It's worth the trip. He has been an inspiration to me ever since. The man is my all-time hero and role model. In my personal experience, he stands as the greatest man in cinema. ""They say we're the same in everything, but you're just wrong, you're wrong."|0
"I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear"" that was shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own ""twist"" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a much better adaptation than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it is a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short."|1
Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Following a few random prisoner deaths, Rackham takes in Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Luckily for everyone, Barbara Bach just happens to be on the island too! Unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.This Italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a dash of WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff.|1
Having worked professionally with young girls on the run , I found this film surprisingly authentic . I would never claim to be a feminist, but the message that girls are powerful , that they should be able to be anything they want and that they are loved no matter how they look is a message I am all for. While I enjoyed this film more the first time through, I am sure there is much more to it than that and would recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach who is willing to take a few chances. This is a great film.|0
"OK the box look interesting , the opening have great music and its kinda original , to that its all good ,but there is only a problem with the bass , there is alot of bass , the bass sound a lil bit weak, its ok, but you will hear a little bit stronger bass when its in live mode , its still a good box i think, the box is light , but it has alot of bass . all in all a good buy ,

If I had to give a single, I would say its an OK box with a good bass."|0
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the ingredients to be just right for a movie. I have watched it twice now. It was not a favorite, but is now my favorite of all time. The plot is simple enough for you to get the whole story. It makes you love the characters and the actors. The acting is superb, you really feel the pain of every moment. I love this movie as it makes you feel the beauty of the world that we experience in our lives.|0
With its few touches of surrealism , LWHTRB works as low-grade horror , but as a major follow-up statement to his debut, we can't help but wonder if it actually does the same thing in a more effective way. The story follows three friends as they explore an old abandoned house in a small town. After an unfortunate encounter with a strange man in an elevator, they realize there may be more going on than they first believed. As they venture deeper into the house, the walls start to close in and their friendship begins to fade.|0
"I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It is a great story and told extremely well. I fell absolutely in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""? (money). That was classic. ; )."|1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this ? There 's a bunch of apes wandering in the wilderness and they need to build a school for them but it turns out the school is made of stone, so they start to fight with the stone and things start to go awry. How they get out of their predicament is left up to the viewer but it does have to be one heck of a watch to see it all unfold in such a fashion. This isn't even the worst movie of the year but it's quite the embarrassment.|0
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, like I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK since I like to express my own opinions quite frequently. If something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. This gives me yet another chance to take my shots at ""The Departed"". When one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful."|1
"Naturally Sadie sucks big time , I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this but they sure did it to good effect

__________________

I think they did a good job on this, but the ending is kind of lackluster, IMO. It seems that there were a lot of loose ends left hanging for at least half the book to wrap up and resolve, which is not exactly the case in this book."|0
This was a nice film. It had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. The storyline kinda reminded me of The City of God. But this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. It had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south Africa. The actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked Estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable.|1
Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.Audio/Video: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks.|1
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood, and produced by and starring James Goldstone and James Earl Jones, who starred in it. I’d seen this movie on DVD many years ago when I was too young to remember anything about it, and had no recollection of it ever bothering me or giving me much concern, until a friend asked me recently if I remembered it. “I remember this from way back!” I said. If you’ve never seen it you’ve missed out on something pretty special.|0
"I was so excited to finally watch ""Pulse"" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of ""A Tale of Two Sisters""."|1
I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this `` film '' . This is one of my all time favorite movies from the 70s. It won an Oscar, it is one of the best horror movies ever made, it had great music and soundtracks that just make the film all the more special. This is why the movie will be one of the top 20 most watched movies of ALL TIME. The film starts out in San Diego in the mid to late 70s, and is based on Stephen King's famous novel The Shining.|0
"Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is . I especially remember the scene in the movie in which Brian Wilson is playing a piano with his mouth. In real life, he was constantly doing that. That is why when someone would call him for something, he would always say, ""I don't know, what do you want me to do?"" because his voice was coming out all weird. I know people that love to talk on the phone. I never like to talk on the telephone, however, I enjoy listening to music over the phone."|0
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high-school students tries a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.|1
Well Folks , this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however , the additional downside includes poor acting , in addition to bad writing and the plot is so contrived that even the characters are too bland . So what do I really mean with this? Well , first , it is just a shame for the gay community that there are still such people out there who think that a gay male can be a real life , complete man in all respects and yet have no understanding of what homosexuality really means in terms of self respect and dignity .|0
In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He did two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. Assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like The Wilby Conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles).|1
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down a arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), things go wrong though & Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US Government. After a big shoot-out most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about, top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US & at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also being sent back to the US.|1
"I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, ""What's so funny?!!"". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it."|1
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion . What makes this film so unsettling is that the viewer is left with the feeling it is happening right now . The only thing that will make the film tolerable for those who are not sensitive to it is if the film can be played in a darkened theater . This film would have to be for those who want to have nightmares . For anyone that has never watched this film before , the film is a must see . This film is a must to be watched . The fact that it is not rated makes it even more horrifying .|0
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing in my life. i have a lot of anger in this review, the first paragraph of this review is an excellent example of how much anger i have over what i just saw. i don't care about this movie, i was never a fan of this movie even though i had never watched it, i was always an avid fan of the tv show because i wanted to see how far they could take this storyline. but this movie just sucked.|0
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour , but nothing more . The film itself may have been a political statement but the film was nothing more . Instead , we get a movie with a good story line but lacking in substance . As far as I am concerned the film was made for the masses to watch . It is a film which should have been taken up by all news channels . But why did the makers choose the wrong channels ? Why did the makers miss the chance to do something which would have got more coverage by the channels ?|0
Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and I spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie even though I have a weakspot for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.|1
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director . My feelings about both the movie and the book are so complex and complex. I love the book. I think it is a really great story, full of interesting characters. I like this movie so much that I am not even going to bother discussing it, because I know you will hate me. I am sorry if this means that my review will be a mess. Let’s just move right along with this review. But first let’s get the plot started.|0
This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites . Castle of Crows was very creepy and you can see the monsters in this film. I liked this film and I enjoyed it a lot. I think that if you want to watch a really good horror movie with great special effects and well directed, then this film should be on your movie list. I’m looking forward for the next movie in the series. I’m not sure about some of the reviews that say that this movie has no plot and no action.|0
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! Well, at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys.|1
I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The acting is good and the story line was OK except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.The film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. It has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for Ash Christian I thought it was good.|1
Ben Marshall , a teen ager from a religious background , is made aware about the financial situation at home and decides to run away from home to see the world. But he finds that his family is not who he thought they were, and he has to find a way to live a normal life after being away from home for a long period of time. It's been 3 years since I was forced to quit smoking and I have been doing very well. After I quit smoking I have never smoked a day since. I had been feeling so depressed after I quit for a couple of years.|0
I'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem.|1
Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it.|1
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.Turd.|1
"Heftig og Begeistret ( Intense and Enthusiastic ) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the north of Denmark. The film follows the choir through their lives, from childhood into adulthood, taking the viewer on a rollercoaster of experiences in their quest of creating their own music. Their music is characterized by the choir’s very unique sound, but also the characters they share, and how their stories are interlinked through the choir. Story
The story takes place mostly in a group of five boys from a very religious and well-connected family."|0
"Okay , so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to get a movie made. But does he have the talent and vision to get a great movie made? Let's look at some of the talent attached to the project, shall we? Alfonso Cuaron

Let's begin with Mr. Cuaron, the director of Gravity, Gravity and Gravity 2. I'm a big fan and have seen every one of his films, but his directorial debut has yet to be a hit in theaters."|0
"I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life, I cannot believe that I wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. Who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where those ""men"" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film."|1
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I only wish Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms...sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. There isn't much interesting going on here but Mr Ford and friends are eye candy.See him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune.|1
"Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"" I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed."|1
This movie was a major bait and switch . I rented it because of Rebecca St. James , a popular actress , who plays a sexy femme fatale who has to seduce the men she encounters in her daily life. I wanted to see if it would have worked as a movie. The movie has everything that a woman could want except a loving husband . So what does that mean in the real world ? It means being a free woman with no strings attached. This movie starts off with Rebecca in her bedroom , naked . She has sex with two guys , one in the street and the other at her apartment.|0
A lot of 'alternative ' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular , misguided , overly-political , and unfunny . It all went hand in hand with the rise of the Thatcher governments of the 1980s and 1990s which saw the demise of many of the traditional liberal arts institutions on which British cultural policy was based. Of course, it's only fair to point out that, in many ways, the cultural policy of the present day is not that different from the cultural policy of the 1980s. So it's hardly surprising that there's still a great deal of humour to be found.|0
Everyone knows that late night movies aren't Oscar contenders. Fine. I mean I'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and figured I'd get to some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the info on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave it half a star. To be fair, I did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious.|1
This is a magnificent , and in many ways impressive film . I saw it on TV as a little kid, and was so fascinated that I asked my mother to buy it for me. When I finally managed to take my mother to see it, I was amazed not so much by the story , but by the acting and the film itself . Now that I have seen it , it will stay with me for many years to come. . . The opening scenes are spectacular . It starts off with a shot in the desert where the sun sets on a group of people walking across a desert landscape.|0
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough.|1
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people , two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah blah. In fact, its a movie about three young idealistic people who get themselves killed by Naxals. So, if you thought the first half of that was a movie about a bunch of idealistic people murdering people, you are wrong. You know, it's true that the first half of the film is more about a bunch of idealistic people murdering someone. But it's true that the film takes on more meaning if you take on the context of how the three idealistic people interact.|0
"This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. It is clear from the start that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. I think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. Sean Bean ""acted"" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was."|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love will have a much more difficult time finding a place to grow and bloom. There's an old saying about how there's no shortage of love and hate in life. But, there is always a shortage of the things that matter. In fact, the closer you live to the things that matter the easier it is, but it's never easy because the things that really matter are always so close you can only dream about them.|0
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane. It was a HUGE waste of time seeing this crappy film. There are a lot of things i hate about this movie: The songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'Grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of Santa' which i hit 10 Times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel.I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen.|1
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair).|1
The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast.|1
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy , yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper . Troy ( Glover ) is a man with a past who’s about to make a choice that could change his entire life. He goes to a diner to meet his estranged daughter, and in order to make up to her for what happened, he has to let her know everything about him and his father that she’ll never know. When she comes to visit, Troy is ready to reveal everything about his family and what happened.|0
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity . He was a gifted performer, one who possessed a wide range of skills. That range of skills was demonstrated through his role in "" Scarface "" when he played Al Capone . He took on the role of this ruthless gangster, a man so powerful and intimidating it was easy to see why he had to be portrayed by someone so talented as Pacino. Even though Pacino had been an actor since he was a young boy, he had a reputation for making a character work despite the constant use of profanity."|0
You know , before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases . I was a big supporter of the American judicial system until I read a couple of books about the corruption within that system . I think that this film should not have had a happy ending , because its not a fair fight . I think that this film was a big waste of money , but I have to admit that I had an emotional attachment to one or two of the characters . I think that this film was very good .|0
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be . There is no story whatsoever , no characters, just a bunch of stereotypes. It just is not good. I did not expect any more from this kind of movie. I am not a fan of westerns . And the movie is full of stereotypes of the west. I did not get it at all. I would be very sad if someone would like to do this with my money . The story was good and there were a few good performances . But this is the end for me .|0
Bad, bad, and did I mention bad? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT director!The only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on Clara Bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the Bone Eater rides on.|1
I'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. Afraid I'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, shame about the execution.|1
Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone? ), but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)|1
This is a fantastic film. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching it, I could see parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece.|1
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie . I actually ran across this movie by accident . I found it on youtube but had no idea what movie I was watching . I went in search for a movie and ended up finding this one . I thought how odd . I saw this in a different country and it was dubbed . I was shocked . I have to admit , I cried the first time I watched this movie . It was just so beautiful . I wanted to cry . You will not find another movie as beautiful . It really took me by surprise .|0
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies , mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond . But what many don't know is that he also did a few horror-thrillers in his early career. In 1971's Night of the Demon and 1972's Night of the Blood Monster , he had a bit part as a detective. The latter one is his debut into horror and he did it so perfectly that it was nominated for Best Screenplay, along with the other two. The story is a simple one, of a man who is trying to find the ghost of a woman he lost years before.|0
"One of the better movies to come out of the 1980 's , this based-on-fact movie tells the story of one man's escape from a Nazi camp. The story is told by many different actors (from many different backgrounds). I thought it was ok. I just can't stand ""The Goonies"". I would have to think about it. I don't know why it bothers me so. The movie was better than expected. It's a really good movie. It's a very well written movie, that I believe a lot of people would get a lot from."|0
Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.|1
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that was both emotional and action packed. After watching it, I was left thinking, “Why did I ever not watch the first season?” I mean I know the main premise is very similar to what I’ve seen a few times, but I was a little disappointed that there were a couple of things that did not gel quite so well for me. As the series unfolds, our heroes are introduced to all new characters.|0
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick . Instead they go around and recreate the same old formula and nothing ever changes. And I don’t blame them. There really is nothing fresh anymore and it’s getting to the point where people don’t even remember what they’ve seen recently. I really wish Hollywood wouldn’t have to go with the same ol’ script for decades. There were a few good ideas here and there but they usually come out a few years later.|0
"If you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.I couldn't help but to think to myself, ""Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?"" Example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck."|1
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not too good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. If you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. It's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was titled HOSTAGE.|1
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the one in the movie. I mean, the guy has got to be one of the top two or three writers on the show. How could he be so incompetent as to write this? I guess if we're going to nit-pick (and we should), then we should nit-pick the episode title, too, but that's about it. It's not a bad title. The show does have a decent title sequence (in fact, that was probably the only thing they did well).|0
It is sad that some find this film worth watching. I am Russian, and I am disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive directorial work.|1
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen . But this movie lacks everything that would make a great Bronson movie. That’s not his fault. It’s Hollywood’s fault as well. The script and direction, and the whole cast just don’t bring you the Bronson you’re looking for. They’re just so different in everything from look, to acting styles, to storyline that you wonder if you’re watching the wrong movie. This film was made as a direct-to-video release.|0
Let 's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : `` Let 's see who's dumb now. He killed millions of human beings. He killed millions of them, by the millions, and what did we do to him? Nothing! Why? We had no problem with killing him. We didn't know he was coming here, and he came here. But you had nothing to do with it. Nothing. He just killed a million or so people, we killed him for it. That's all it is.|0
I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a Mexican soap opera.Also the acting was terrible especially Charityn and her son. That's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. I'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means Dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.|1
"oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry ""D"" student able to outsmart only stupid people."|1
I am sorry to rain on everybody 's parade . Just a little background about me : I like and love to play the piano. I'm also self taught so I have very little experience. I would be glad to practice for hours if necessary! I have experience with music in general, I've played all kinds of instruments, from mandolin and guitar to piano, drums and more. I'm good with music theory (but no one in particular!) and can play pieces by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, etc.|0
This movie was sooo bad . It was n't even funny at all . Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny . The only good part i can say is the last 2 seconds . The movie is a total waste . I want to watch this . It will never work as a movie . It will never work as a movie . The people who should sue this movie because this is their fault . I've seen this many many times since i've had the chance. Everytime i watch i get so angry that how can anyone be like this?|0
I saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as I hit the street, like ... you see, I can't even think of one!|1
Look, don't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON! I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I am sorry to be so harsh but come on!|1
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty.|1
"Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name ""employee of the month"" might ring bells with ""Office Space,"" and the show ""Office Clerk."" I think not. This isn't even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7."|1
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . . . and that is still true today. The first thing that hit me in the screening was the fact that I had seen every Batman film ever made, and I was amazed that I remembered them all (I don’t really, but I thought I did), and I couldn’t believe what I saw in this new one. Then I got to see how far the characters had come and the worldbuilding that went into the making of it all.|0
If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris , more shallow than Paris Hilton , and more obsessed with sex than Paris, here is your answer . A show about sex. The show “A Very Sexy Christmas” debuted on Sunday night (November 26) on Fox Family Channel. This is the second year Fox Family is bringing sexy holiday special programming to our screens. It’s all a little weird, though. It starts with Fox Family Channel announcing that, “a very sexy new comedy” will premiere at 8:30 pm ET on December 2.|0
"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one."|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end . The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on the world, but I enjoyed it so much because it was a completely different perspective than anything I thought of when I was in kindergarten. This book would be great for a middle schooler (or anyone else, really) who loves reading. This book was great! The characters were well written, the illustrations were gorgeous and the story was exciting. Even though I was a young adult when I read this book I was still able to understand and enjoy it as a young adult.|0
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution would n't even need to see the film to say `` fake '' . We've all seen or heard about it in the news , on television , and read about it in science books . We have heard it called the "" Big Bang "" story . We know that the Big Bang happened some 14 billion years ago . But , the truth is, no one knows for sure . We just don't know how it happened . It could have been the result of a star that exploded . A supernova ."|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray . That 's because it was so good ! The characters were very real , and the acting was very good ! This movie was released a couple of days after I got out of the hospital for the third time. I was feeling better and ready to do a lot more acting . I didn't get any more acting experience after this film . I only did two more movies . One thing I would say is that the movie isn't too long. It's just right .|0
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore . I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted the Mormon movies top . I don’t trust any ratings that are given on IMDB and I think the best way to go is to go to the IMDB website directly. I really don’t understand why they allow you to rate a movie by clicking a thumbs up button. If I could rate it I would give it 5 thumbs up. And if I had a dollar for everyone who rates a movie with a thumbs up, I would give it $2.|0
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely . . . and in a good way, I mean . . . it took the cake . . . that was probably the best thing about this movie . . . the cake . . . just the icing on the old . . . cake . . . well I'll stop now . . . anyway this was a lot of fun, I guess . . . I'm not too sure what it is . . .|0
Based on the comments made so far , everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . I personally have loved this movie for many reasons , but one of the major reasons was the way the final scenes were filmed. In my opinion, the best scene is the part when she's on her death bed and you can hear the tears rolling down her cheeks. That's why i will be watching it again, just to see how she looks when she's dying and what she says, and what is written on those pictures.|0
There was a recent documentary on making movies , that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about the challenges of getting their films made and how they were able to overcome them. In one of the actors’ case, the challenges were a result of getting cast in the roles they were in, getting cast for the parts they got, and getting paid to do their films. The other actor in their case spoke of a different problem. That actor pointed to what he believed were obstacles in the process of directing and creating films, but was unable to fully articulate what those obstacles were.|0
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version . In my first attempt at watching it , I was a little disappointed, but in the second , I found the film is a great movie, I really liked. This movie was very different from the original, in fact, this movie was more of a story of a man who had lost his way. But he wasn’t just a normal person, he was an alien, and he was able to be close to human beings, but he was still alone .|0
A vg Brit rom-com , one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy . Quirky and entertaining , it tells the story of a single mom of four who decides to try a new school . Unfortunately she is paired up with an overachiever who she feels is not a good fit for her children . As the story unfolds we learn about her life and family . It's a quirky , quirky story and one I think a lot of kids would enjoy . My only complaint is the music . It's pretty good but I think the story is better without it .|0
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.|1
"This movie reeks . No money , no acting , no nothing . I caught this on on the 3am cable last night and didn't think i'd be able to write my review when the credits rolled

I think i'm going to have to re-write this. I don't know how to word it . The story is great . This is a story about people and about how they are and how they act , but it is one of those rare movies that takes you inside a person's mind . That is the most accurate way i can describe it ."|0
Oh f * cking hell , where should I start ... First of all ; this show is just another example of how dumb America is ... America needs to be made to take a good hard look in the mirror and admit what it is ... a nation of two classes (rich and poor) ... I have been saying this for decades , America needs a new revolution ... But , I guess that is the type of thing that needs to come from the likes of Glenn Beck and those people ... that is all it is right now , its all that is left to them and they should be ashamed of themselves ...|0
"I was really beginning to enjoy this show . It just started out slow and it was n't given the time or attention it deserves . But after the first 4 episodes it was getting into the swing of things . The show really took off in episode 3 or 4. And I'm looking forward to next week's episode as well . I'll be sad when I have to miss this show when I have to fly to Australia to visit family . I'm only going for a short visit . __________________

I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest.|1
"I just realized why the colors and sets in ""Sakuran"" were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn't call it acting."|1
It is terrible! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful.|1
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing . All the acting was very well done and the story was told quite well . A few things have been changed and some very good ideas have been taken . A film that will definitely please the movie lover in this country who likes the action/ action oriented film . This is one of those stories that needs to be viewed on TV . The cast and the crew are all very professional and very professional actors . The only negative point about the film is that the last part was too long and some of it was a waste of time .|0
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive.In its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film.|1
This movie is # 1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen , with `` Lessons for the Dead `` I can say it is the worst movie of all time , so you have to watch this movie at the lowest point in your life to get the real picture. This was a great movie , with a great director and an amazing cast but this movie is full of so much bad that you can not get through the whole movie. I would not watch this film again . You will have a horrible time with this movie if you watch it again.|0
I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up . I was greeted by this message “Sorry, we're unable to display your location”. Is this because I am in the US? Or maybe because I just don’t “look” American? I live in London and am trying to watch the whole series but it seems I am missing out. Can I watch the episode? If you are viewing this page from a country other than the one you are viewing it from, please change your browser's location to a location that is recognized by your country.|0
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama . The lush settings , the haunting music , and the powerful performances all combine in a triumph for director and cast alike . It's a movie of the kind of high art I think I can only write about when I see it in theaters , but I had the honor to attend the first preview screening of this film last spring , and I saw a different movie on screen that evening than I had seen on any of the many, many hundreds of other screenings I attended in that theater , in all of Los Angeles and the surrounding areas.|0
"This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by ""Friday the 13th"". ""The Prey"" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.But ""The Prey"" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason."|1
A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving you wondering why you’ve wasted your time watching a TV show with a writer of such poor quality. But then you remember that at its most basic level the show is trying to tell a story. In fact, it seems to me that a very good case can be made for this being one of the best examples of the ‘story told in a series of stories’ model of narrative structure, which I’ll explain in a moment.|0
being a fan of Bela Lugosi , Boris Karloff , and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe. this movie was so dull i just turned the lights off and left. the story was so dumb and stupid i couldnt even finish it. its not that the story is stupid it was just stupid. the acting was horrible and the plot was stupid as hell. the ending sucked. i would have done better with this movie by watching it at home and not have to sit through this. its a total waste of my time.|0
"GOLD RAIDERS (1951)A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, who I've always enjoyed as the ""third Stooge"") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting."|1
I 'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a theater I could not believe that it wasn't made by Disney. I saw it again just the other week. I could not miss it again! The plot, the music, the cinematography, the direction, and the animation are all wonderful. They all fit the time and the story very well. It shows that Walt Disney could make a movie even better than he did in the last few, if not all of his previous works.|0
I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen.|1
Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name `` employee of the month '' might ring bells with people in a job-centric business, but it might come off as a bit weird to outsiders. It's one thing for the people in the workplace to want to be remembered for their performance, but it's another thing for that person to put himself on the pedestal of being the most important person there. In most of the examples I've used, there wasn't a lot of thought behind it. It seems like a little too much.|0
This was not a good movie ! ! Why do you people keep saying that ? There is a nice plot to this movie, it has a nice twist in the plot and I have nothing to complain about ! I just wish they had used better actors, but they did have some good actors. The story is really interesting. The only thing is that it doesn’t add anything new to the genre or the world, and I am not a big fan of the genre. The ending was kind of disappointing for me.|0
I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through.|1
"... now please move on because that 's getting on my nerves.Seriously , the man behind brilliant pieces like ``The Little Drummer Boy'', ``Jaws'' and ``The Little Mermaid'' knows how to make an audience want to read and see more.But it is not just the books, you have his music and movies to watch out for too.

There is only one book that can stand beside this book in the literary canon - or any canon as far as I am concerned. It is the story of a young mother who gives birth to three babies."|0
"This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a Jeff Bridges fan as I am I guess.Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road. His parents believe he is ""just acting out"" and talk about how ""he has no plan""."|1
This film works on a lot of different levels . It 's a profile of one very cool couple , but more importantly it gives us a glimpse into the mind of a great filmmaker . And it 's one hell of a portrait of a great woman . that is the woman that made this film , but it 's just as important to say that she is also a brilliant actor . her husband is a wonderful writer , but the real reason to see this film is that it is so full of love and support for a great woman that it is also so full of love and support for an excellent man .|0
"Once again Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. The fact that ""The Evil That Men Do"" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. One hopes this fine actor will rise again."|1
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival , we have titles from all over the world . China , the US , India , Japan , South Korea and Germany were the main markets of the Split Film festival , which was held on June 11 to June 14 . The festival started with a welcome speech by the Director General of the China Film Co. Ltd. , Yu Ji . Yu said the festival was about “competition feature films” and “to make films that would change the world and change the industry” .|0
"I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie . The first 1 hour was just awful, and the last 3 or 4 were so boring and unmemorable (in fact, the entire movie was just that)

I am a huge fan of The Goonies. But to me this movie was just so boring, I was going to give it a 0. I don't care much for the first hour or so but I loved the last part of the movie, it was just so much better. It was a fun movie to watch."|0
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time , I was n't expecting a show with complex stories, complex characters and complex plot twists in complex ways. I knew it was going to be complicated. I had no idea of the length of the show as a whole. What I thought I would do was just pick an episode and watch it. A few days after watching the series, I had watched the entire series. Not only did it have complex story and characters , but it also was an experience that many people would never be able to see or even imagine.|0
"I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war ""hippies"" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army."|1
Sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film.|1
i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels ; from production to plot and character development.this definitely left a lot of space for improvement and I really like the way that they have been going about things in the story department in this season. I look forward to the rest of this season for sure. It's always a shame when a show only lasts a season. This show did a great job with it's story and was very entertaining to watch through. They really put a lot into this episode and it shows on all levels.|0
I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt.|1
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality , as it will give a very brief introduction of this unique concept that was so hard for many people to believe in the beginning. Total Reality started as a short documentary about human cloning, but it quickly became an amazing feature-length film about life after death. The movie is a testament to the truth that is found at the end of human existence. Total Reality is a very simple movie with just a single message. At the conclusion of the movie the viewers will understand the beauty and joy of life.|0
After watching this film, I thought to myself, they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really nice eye candy. They really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of Hollywood just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.Why am I critiquing this film? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver.|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts.|1
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother.|1
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen . It 's hard to explain though , because ( I can't speak for the other 2 but ) it just isn't funny. I mean, there is a plot, there are some funny parts , just the whole thing is just not funny. I would not recommend this to a friend , even if they liked it . It is not for a comedy fan like me . I would not watch this at all , even though it had some nice parts in the beginning. Very disappointed.|0
Peter Watkins ' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced , uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape in a distant future. Punishment Park shows the world that the old ways are gone and that we need to change the way we think and act. It is an eye-opening look at a society in a constant state of crisis, an allegory to how our society works and a wake up call that it is up to us to decide the fate of the planet and our way of life. If you want to see what it looks like today and the future, this is the place to be.|0
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare .I am very disappointed and very sad .I was very excited with this game i had to buy it but i did not get it . As the story goes, a team of soldiers are sent to an abandoned island in the Pacific. There, in the dark and isolated areas, they are to find and destroy an alien invasion. This alien race is known as The Aliens. While the story doesn't make any reference to the aliens or their invasion, this is still the case.|0
"This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her ""Follow Me"" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place."|1
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes , a hard-working guy doing what he loves , there is a reason why he's winning this game for you , and it isn't just because of the points he's getting . I know how you feel, and I really have no words to say what I'm feeling right now. But that doesn't mean it can't be taken. The thing is, if you took it out of context, you'd be saying that you'd rather have Brad get nothing than not Brad get anything at all.|0
The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics . While the theme seems common , the execution is not . I had no idea how good this film was going to be until I saw it . But it is very very good . There are a few plot holes , but for the most part , it is an excellent film . And it is worth seeing in a single sitting . What the film does is tell you a story . It gives you a basic premise . That is all that is required for the story to work .|0
"Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. At the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers to ""What's this? "", ""What will happen? "", ""What's happening? "", ""What's wrong? "", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.Because everyone's looking at the TV, normally shy students become vocal."|1
"I usually do n't categorize a moving as boring . I am not big on action flicks and my senses are dull to them, so I usually skip them completely, but I think I will watch one or two to get a feel for a film before I write about my opinion of them, because I could not write about all of them. I had the chance to check out a new film at the theater this past week and the first thing I said to my husband after the end of the credits was, ""I don't like that film, it just doesn't have any entertainment value."""|0
This extraordinary pseudo-documentary , made in 1971 , perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today ... which makes it all the more amazing, given that it took so long. Hugely entertaining ... It tells a tale of American life that's as relevant today as it was back then, from the music of the Beatles to the civil rights movement and the Watergate scandal. But it's not just any story of the past. It tells the story of American life as it was lived in the 1970s, but with a modern-day angle: it is a portrait of a country that is in decline.|0
Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.The music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and under-developed.|1
"My wife and I couldn't even finish the film. Truly, it was rather painful.First, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For instance, Augustus takes the ""burden"" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.Second, the camp! My lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this."|1
I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. What was John Landis thinking?I know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! Even kids hate this movie. It's pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.I think the only reason The Stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.|1
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example: When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain, I was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it. Nothing! Are you kidding me? A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations. Overall, small children will enjoy this, parents will endure it without too much complaining.|1
"Okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time ""horror"" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie?"|1
"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must."|1
Most awful casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack head, a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on.............Stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the streets. It's a joke!The only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that I finished watching it. I just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end.Trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie. Trying to be freaky. So stupid!|1
Like the previous two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film.|1
"This is almost Ed Wood territory. Yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. And that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that ""anti-matter"" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie."|1
"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (""You're just making it up as you go along!"" ""Yup, but I do it brilliantly""), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of ""get on with it""."|1
I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino.|1
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s . Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good films but here are the three he did in the 1960s that are worth your time. Otto Preminger was one of the best filmmakers of his day . He was not only a great visual artist , but he was also the master of film noir. His films are always stylish and full of atmosphere. In this film you will see him at his very best . If you have not seen this movie you are in for a real treat.|0
"it 's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is , I just wanted to add that the only thing I can say about these poll is, it is very hard to make a negative statement about something that has been positive from the word go

What do you think makes this so special and why isn't it just another poll for the rest of us to wade into. i am very happy that you took the time to reply to me, but I don't think that is the problem here."|0
my friends and i watched this movie last night . it was pretty incredible . by all means , this movie has its merits , and i can't say it was a total flop . but the movie has so much going for it that i found myself giving it a 6.5 . i'm not sure of a better movie to watch during the summer , but it doesn't stand out to me on the top ten . the movie has a great cast , but i don't like their characters , and they just don't seem to gel well .|0
"The thing which makes ""Fire"" even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry, is its touch of femininism and rebellion. To my mind, the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife Sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy, as per the same narrative which appears in the film too."|1
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.The Good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about Theresa ChanThe Bad :The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No linkage between the 3 story lines. Minimum DIALOGUE in the film, substituted by SMSs and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.|1
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now . I enjoyed the movie 's story , and the music was very well played . But I really wish there was a lot more to it all .I am not sure how I would have liked a movie that had a much longer run-time to tell it all . The movie was very good. I saw it twice in two different theaters , once with my husband who really liked it . I have watched it twice since then , as well . I have the DVD with my husband and my other two daughters .|0
This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy.|1
"Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows.Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining. ""The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog."|1
"I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about ""Dinosaurs eat people."" However, it was disappointing even on that level.For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly ""enough"" dinosaurs."|1
Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean, gripping, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years.|1
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie . I did n't like it at all . I think it has good and bad side . but overall its a good movie and its better to be watched in 2-3 day . It was not easy to watch and I am not so comfortable watching a movie on the night , but I know it was worth watching at least . So lets hope it will be good in its 2d version . I don't have much to say, other than I liked this movie and was glad I could see it for free at home.|0
Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers.|1
Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . This is simply a `` run of the mill '' adventure game . I can see what the hype was all about , but it does seem to be missing the point , even after the first 30 or 40 hours or so of playing. I've been playing through this since I first started playing the original, and this is my second playthrough. I've found it to be an excellent game, in many ways superior to the original as well as many other games released for the SNES in the past few years.|0
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance . i went from suspended disbelief to being completely in it . this is a movie with so many good things to love . this is how a movie like that should be . but in the middle of the movie is the worst part . when the movie takes a serious turn and goes back to the start of the book . i have read it several times but i think i'm still getting used to the book and to watching it as it was originally written .|0
I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Ben I thought this is going to be a little treat.Oh how I felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.2.|1
The plot : Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct , and is looking for his 1st film to do just that. A story of a man who wants to take his son to see the film that his son saw last week. This is where I come in, as I have seen it, and have a story of my own, that I hope will add to his film . I thought I’d try it out here . I know I’m in good company as I was the second person to see the film, but that is ok by me .|0
No , no , no . That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film for the first time before you buy it. If you like it you will go back and buy it. You have to be patient and let it soak in. I found out after I bought it that it was a masterpiece. It makes you think that you could be a painter, writer, poet and so on. You have to make a choice whether to do that. I don’t know why I like this film so much.|0
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that's not saying too much.|1
"I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon."|1
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. I suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can I say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (Omega Code, Left Behind).|1
Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do ! I was appalled . Do NOT take kids to see it . I don't see how people can put this in a place of such honor . If I could I would put this on every movie theater screen . I don't think people in this world have any respect for us as human beings . They want to see this horror . This is wrong . Shame shame shame ! I was appalled and was so sad . The kids and the parents didn't know how to deal with it. Shame Shame Shame !|0
After just viewing the movie , I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is my second time watching it, first time was when it came out and it was good, then again when it came out with a 3D it sucked, now I have to admit I really enjoy this type of films. Not to say it's not worth seeing but I'm very disappointed in this one. I just finished watching the first season of the new series on HBO, and I have to say, the show is one of my favorites.|0

The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? There is a scarecrow murdering people there. Only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. Whats the scarecrows secret? Will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK but picture is really corny. The plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical.|1
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking.|1
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other heist film has come close to it, before or after. The plot is simple, but engrosses you. It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. You care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. It's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois.|1
"Korea's answer to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary."|1
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie , I 'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan. I think she can do no right in the comedy department. I was hoping for something more than she did here. But, I saw the movie anyway. I didn't know it was a movie review and decided I would watch the movie. I can see how this might be something you might enjoy. So, let's begin.... The plot for the movie follows an ex-Marine who gets in a car accident and his girlfriend dies.|0
"...and in this series, I've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, ""Xena, the Warrior Princess"", and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for TV."|1
Okay, When I bought this flick I though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the Earth and starts right away to kill people! Well, It was almost everything what I expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. Acting has to be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? Reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring.|1
`` The Quickie '' tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and ... well , frankly, that's what happens when you use the word Malibu. We're talking about the Malibu of the '60s. This is a story set in the 1950s, and like all such stories, it involves a couple's love life, but it's not a love story. And unlike most such stories, it actually has a happy ending (or at the very least, there's no reason for them to be unhappy at all).|0
I ca n't remember the series , I believe it may have been `` American Masters '' , but it may be similar to that of `` The American Storyteller ' 's'' , with the main difference being that this is a true historical drama , not fiction . for those of you who remember , it was on television for a few seasons , and may have aired some in the 50's . but this time it is being released as a movie . and with the release of this new version , this is my chance to review `` American Masters '' and give my thoughts on the release of this movie .|0
In fact it was awful . The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director. I am not saying these are the absolute best of the worst . They are good for their time but the acting is so bad that it's not funny . I guess it was a popular choice back when it first came out but I guess not many people went to see it then . The only reason why it has made it into my top 20 movies is because it was so awful that I just started watching it .|0
Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, I was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. It wasn`t just Bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. Add to that a plot liken to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as I`m concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I taped it.|1
In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during WWII. In a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.This is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the Ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated.|1
`` I remember waiting to be born ... '' `` Vision quest that was the American West . '' `` I was going to die at that moment I had to kill him .'' `` I've been waiting to die .'' `` It's like an earthquake .'' `` My life has been waiting for this moment .'' `` If I was to die at this moment I would die with dignity .'' `` It seems I have lived my entire life in the shadow of my mother . '' `` My life would have been easier had I not waited .''|0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail.|1
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) had first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. The film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one.|1
Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it.|1
My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit.|1
I absolutely hated this movie . Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message , it failed miserably . Why is this movie rated so highly even though it had no substance ? Why is this movie still a blockbuster despite its poor quality ? There was absolutely nothing unique about it . There were too many stupid , lame and stupid characters . And as far as the film went , I wasn’t really impressed . But that’s the problem with movies today . The only person in the movie who had a personality was the lead actor .|0
Well , this film came on on a workday at 230am . The cute little actress who played Billy caught me off guard . The whole movie was amazing , with great performances from everyone . This is one of my all-time favorite films of the 70s . I love this one . A great little comedy . A great movie . Just great ! I saw this with my dad at a midnight showing one night, I must have seen it once before, but my dad remembered it and went out of his way to find it again. It's such a funny movie, with great writing and wonderful performances.|0
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true."|1
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls.|1
Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim.|1
A young man , named Danny , has run away from home and meets a drifter , named Bix , on the road. They make friends , but they have no food or money to get to the next town. So they stop at the diner and order some food. When the food runs out , they need to go look for food , so they go to find a food. The town is very poor and most of the residents are old and sick. Danny tries to find a place to stay but ends up in a room at the bar, and Bix goes back to camp.|0
As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic I am, I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday, I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.The movie is truly more character/story driven than action.|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.|1
"Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes to great lengths to remind us; but he makes it clear from the first word of the first paragraph that he did not come up with it all by himself - and it was certainly not done on a blank sheet of paper:

In 1601, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the celebrated natural philosopher and mathematician, Francis Bacon, wrote a book titled The New Organon of Natural Knowledge, which contains a chapter on the subject of the human body."|0
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left a lot more impressed with the later ones than the original. The first film has always been one of my favorite films and it’s no wonder that all three of them end up being good. The first one is probably the most violent, brutal and disturbing of the whole series (but with a lot of humor too). The third one was my favorite. But what made them all so good for me? I think it has something to do with the characters.|0
"The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately ""interesting"" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the ""in crowd"" and eventually starts hanging with them."|1
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank holdup. After he gets out of the car and goes through the vault, he discovers that they stole the money out of the bank's safe and no one has returned it yet. He ends up running into a bank teller and she ends up shooting him with a crossbow because she wants to kill him. This is where Seagal enters the story: he is just a regular guy trying to get out of a life of crime.|0
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff ( splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne ) is an eccentric recluse who keeps himself to himself in the woods at the edge of a remote lake in Wisconsin. He spends much of the time fishing, but has a special relationship with one fish, a large and beautiful rainbow trout that is the center of his world . He has been fishing for twenty years, and has had his share of mishaps, including losing several of his best fishing rods ( one has become his lucky horseshoe for years ).|0
This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. A must see for all who like Indie and for those who don't. I think this movie will draw more into the Indie scene. The acting was top notch! The character of Alice was portreyed so well. With perfect akwardness. This movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! I think it would do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is untouched by the Hollywood hand.|1
"eXistenZ was a good film, at the first I was wondering what is going on, organic ""pods"" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.But once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.Security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !"|1
Writer & director Jay Andrews , a.k.a . Jim Wynorski , serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a pair of horror films. He is one of several directors working today to make an art-house horror movie. In the process he has established a style that is unique, and his horror films are among the most distinctive in the genre today. His films were filmed on low budget and shot on location in real houses and apartments. He worked closely with actors and actresses to cast them in the parts he needed. He often used special effects, making his films look like they cost much more than they did.|0
Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be.|1
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. The acting was OK but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.What bothered me the most about this film was the Celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. The directing and continuity was pretty bad too! **SPOILER** For example, after Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio.|1
"A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a ""little man gets his chance"" movie, and it's a ""how far would you go?"" movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in as Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse bum. This movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of Lousiana Cajun horse drag racing. He has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. ""had nothing but a filling station and a good horse."""|1
I loved this show . I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. it was a great night. I also got the rock candy. I have never been able to get that chocolatey flavor before. It is my new must-have flavor of the season. The only thing that disappointed me is that when the girl and boy kiss on the roof top, it was just to make it look better. If you can get this show, you should watch it . I would recommend it to any fan of the rock n'roll show and any girl who likes to kiss a boy.|0
New rule. Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea.Sadly, this movie doesn't. They have the premise that Bounty hunters go out and kill Zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten bounties for one Zombie? Why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a Zombie finger? Not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle.I sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and FX guys.|1
"Mr. Bean has always been my favorite . No matte how many times you watch the same thing , the way he reacts to the situation is always so natural and hilarious . I am very disappointed that his voice actor has left the show , but i really don't mind because i think that his voice is really great . I also love to watch the episode "" Bean's first trip to Africa "" , it's a very sad moment but very funny too . I hope he will come back to the show soon . This show makes me smile so much every day ."|0
"Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call `` humor '' . That this movie has so little integrity that a man is willing to lie and deceive in order to make himself into a villain of a movie is disgusting and repulsive in the highest degree. In the end, one is forced to conclude that the only person who is interested in seeing Moore's film is Moore himself. Thursday, April 26, 2013

I'm going to take some time now to explain the basic reasons why I have chosen to leave the Democratic Party and why I would never vote for Hillary as a Democrat again."|0
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.In relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. Years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series.|1
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival ( World Premiere ) .A haunting , intimate portrait of two people who have known love and lost it. We see them in the last moments of each other’s life, with each taking the other for granted, and only then realizing that life is far too short to do what we did not want to do. This is a film about life and love , about how we live or don't live, what we learn when we fail or succeed , and how we feel when we lose and find love and when our lives intersect with another's.|0
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty ' Arbuckle movie . I really liked his earlier ones, but the one before this has always been the one for me . I always thought this guy was funny, and I liked him from the very beginning of his career. I liked his first film , The Fat Man , and I was really impressed with it. I liked his acting in it, too. But the movie did not do well at the box office , and many people thought that the movie was no good.|0
This was a very good PPV , but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later , the WWE crammed so much shit in its PPV package , that it made for an interesting viewing experience that lasted all of 7 minutes. It was worth watching, but if you're interested in knowing what PPVs should be, or want to know what made this one unique from the rest of the year, then it's really not worth it. Here is a list of all the things the WWE put in this PPV, starting with the most pointless, then the pointless ones, and the ones I liked the best.|0
"This movie was pointless. I can't even call it sci-fi, since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space. ""Max Q"" isn't even set in space for the entire movie. The story/plot is unoriginal, the cast isn't anything to write home about, although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film... Furthermore, it's not particularly exciting or well-told. At least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally bland."|1
"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""Letyat zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the verge of WWII. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war starts. Boris is promptly sent off to war. Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son, whom she does not love."|1
"""The Bone Snatcher"" starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen, and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well."|1
This is a low budget , well acted little gem . Alice , a small town Massachusetts teenager , fed up with the town's strict moral code , decides to quit school and take off with some friends. They go to Chicago , where they join a band . While in Chicago , Alice finds a job and a place to stay. She soon falls for a nice guy named Jim . The band is soon forced to relocate , leaving Alice to try to find her way in her new surroundings . Alice becomes the town drunkard , and finds a new best friend in Jim .|0
It's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(Anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), Anderson's unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell......That's why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much. Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days.|1
Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that.|1
For several reasons , this movie is simply awful . Other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical errors . To me , there is just nothing new about this movie . It seems that there are far too many films in the genre of this movie . It really makes you wonder if any film can ever be good , let alone one as low quality as this . It is hard to even watch . It just does not look good . The movie is simply awful . You will never find any good things to say about it .|0

I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt the same excitement in watching the movies as i do it now. In other words , i no longer have the same taste for watching the movies. But i must say this, there is so much of stuff happening in movies today , that we dont even know about it anymore, it just happens, we just cant believe how fast it has gone, and how much we have gained from it, which is probably the reason why i started watching movies again.|0
"Of all the movies in the history of movies I can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called ""Breeders."" Lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of ""It Came from Outer Space"" instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds?"|1
"Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot ""Thirst"" - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong."|1
I love dissing this movie . My peers always try their best to defend it , probably out of love for that movie . It is really hard to get it right . I think it is better than most horror movies made in Hollywood today . I know a lot of fans of the horror movies are really hard to please , they are very picky and they don't like anyone who gives them an honest review . I don't know why the horror fans like this movie so much . When i watched it , I felt very bad because I didn't try my best .|0
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par.|1
Cheezy ? Yep . Poorly filmed ? You betcha . Zero budget ? They proudly claim it on their posters. I don't get it ? Why ? What am I missing ? There are many films that are not great and some are great and all are mediocre and all are a masterpiece. So what's the difference between mediocre and a masterpiece ? Why some mediocre films get made and some great ones do not ? I don't know. It doesn't really make sense. Do you ? Do you know ? There are many filmmakers who take risks and take the time to make a great movie ?|0
Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation ? The whole `` Complete Jane Austin '' series as an example. It's the same thing with the series `` Jane Eyre. ''' When you see '' Jane Eyre. ''' you get an idea of the story. But when they try to give you a story with Jane Austen as a main character and Jane Eyre in the end, it's really a dreadful adaptation. It doesn't make much sense at all.'' It's not just that the series was awful. It was awful, from the start.|0
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were also tons of great movies made at the time about teenage sexuality. Some of them I’d be scared to watch again but it was nice to look back and know what went into those movies. I had no interest in going to a school movie and being scared to the bone, that was a rare thing in my teenage movie experience. I would have to go to see a school play or concert and I didn’t mind that.|0
CAUTION SPOILER : At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after the end credits had played. There is no mention of why or what caused the collapse. It could just be a natural disaster or the movie makers made an honest mistake but it does look like a fake accident. At the very end of the movie the movie makers are making a statement that there was a human error and that it would not be repeated. I am curious if anyone actually saw the movie and if they did what was your opinion of it.|0
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few . Let us take a look at the most glaring:

-There is absolutely no sense of drama in the film. There is no real tension, no real conflict, nothing to make us want to watch the movie over again to see if it was a good one or not. -The acting is horrible. The acting throughout the movie leaves the viewer with no clue as to who these people are, how they act, or why they are acting the way they are."|0
Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By the way, what has become of Ms. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry.This to me was almost like an 1850s version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver takes a position as a governess to a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity.While I realize that this is a period peace, it was awfully dull even for 1850 England and Scotland.The lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers.|1
One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen . Since these are not characters in this story it is not possible to use any of the character's names in the story, but there is so much homophobic language spoken that it could easily be mistaken as real-life conversation. I found the acting very poor and the storyline very confusing. In this movie, we meet two men with a common problem. They have no romantic attraction with each other. Instead of solving this problem, however, they are forced into having sex.|0
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers.|1
Another lame attempt to make a movie `` gritty '' and `` thought provoking '' - whatever the hell that means. That's all we need with these movies these days. It's just not happening. If you like movies that have an interesting plot and/or characters, then I recommend this movie. But, if you want a movie that just makes you cry or laugh at the same time, then you will want to go back in time and fast forward to the 80's or 90's to see it in a theater.|0
I recently rented this promising mini series , I did n't even know they had adapted it for television . The show is about two girls , Anna and Anna , they are best friends and when they realize they were adopted and were raised in a foster home in the 80s , they decide to get their birth mothers to pay their medical expenses and raise the money they owe from the trust fund. It was great and I thought they might have adapted it into a film . The characters are very well done and it seems like the writers did their research .|0
"Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams "" Depalma , DePalma , Depalma ""Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own ."|1
I think `` Rosemary 's Baby '' is the most overrated horror film out there . Not scary , interesting or even well directed . The script by Robert Bloch is a mess that doesn't work as an independent film and has no plot . In fact the plot is written so much that it can only work as an anthology . This is where the problem starts . You have three or four stories in which all have the exact same basic plot but the characters are completely different . For example if you follow the characters through all the three stories in the film you will get the exact same story but different characters .|0
The movie with its single set , minimal cast , and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief, spectacular aerial-photo sequences) is all that can be expected of a low-budget sci-fi film. However, it's far from being just another of the many poor-quality American low-budget genre films. Based on the best-selling book, the movie opens with a very brief glimpse into what is to come, as some of the space station personnel are shown taking a stroll to a nearby town. Soon after, the camera pans down to reveal several space station personnel entering a building, presumably a pub.|0
"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the ""Wackiest Ship in the Arm"" and the ""Pink Sub"" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and ""pirate"" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot."|1
"I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I'm having a hard time describing these shorts. Let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. They stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled ""Pizza"" in which they use one very well."|1
Just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . Take Mike Myers , for example . What an absolute idiot. He is one of the best comedians of the last 20 years , but he is the absolute worst actor in this movie . And he was the best . Why? Well , I must say that at this point in my career , I'm ready to just say anything for an audience to enjoy , so it was a lot of fun watching this movie with my wife and our 6-year-old . I loved it .|0
"Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad . This movie is a prime example of present day Hollywood . You do not want to buy this dvd , do not buy this movie . If you have the opportunity go for the movie "" ""

This is the best movie I have ever seen. You just have to be in the know to enjoy this movie. This is an eye-opener for those who think they are doing what is right for their country but they don't know that their government is helping to keep them down."|0
"I would like to know if ""The Outsiders"" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD?There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total.The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called ""Black Forest Clinic"" which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync. I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions, thank you in advance."|1
"You know, before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, ""they must have been guilty"" I reasoned?I formed this opinion over some years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He would ""bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be ""back on the street by noon""."|1
So I caught this one afternoon as `` What Lies Above '' and actually watched it because the beginning was so good. When I saw that there was a second version that was much, much better I watched that one too. What Lies Above and its second version are really great. I've seen other versions and they're so bad! I like this one a lot. There's a lot of good things about this film. I love the opening (I don't know if I can describe it any other way.|0
i love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the Jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more.|1
"As I watched this movie , I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head , and that I could hear a voice as if coming from behind my closed eyes

It was the kind of movie that makes you think and wonder , but then you have to watch the movie to find out what happens . And it will happen . It is very strange , but a great movie . But I am afraid that it is a very weird movie

This is my third time to see this movie and each time it is a different experience ."|0
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw. The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. You can't see anything in this movie. It is way to dark. The parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done so much better then this.|1
Take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights and you'll probably end up with what you've seen in the video. A lot of the time , it's very dark , and you are not able to distinguish between people , objects, or other people that may not be able to see you in the darkness. This is an example of ambient light. So the question that we have to ask ourselves when we think about ambient light in our world, is what is light , actually?|0
I attended a screening of this movie. It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? It obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. Nice thought to bank on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major miss. There was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best.|1
"Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh 's head , which is always hidden behind a mask with a gun on it's side, is the same person who wanted to show the world how to build a nuclear bomb

You can see the picture here, it is a photo taken from a documentary film, it shows a few people in a room talking to Himesh, the man behind the movie. They are talking about him and how he helped them to get the movie out

I know it sounds insane, but it is all in a good way."|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art . This is an oblivious film , one that makes you aware of the human condition and then lets that awareness become a cathartic catharsis. If you are looking for a film to take your mind and soul away from your daily life and put you into a more introspective and meditative place, you could do worse than watching this movie. You have to know that this is the movie of the decade. Every film released this year has been considered the best.|0
Its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... But ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.I like Patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie..... ARGH....This movie is so booooooring, the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING.|1
O boy, was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV.|1
This movie was terrible . The acting was awful . The script was awful . What was even worse were the plot holes . . . . The only reason I gave it an 8 was because I really think that the characters were just made to get the money . . . . What are the plot holes? 1 . I found the dialogue and dialogue in the middle part to be the best . . . . I would say that this was a better film then most of the others on this list. . . . However, I would not recommend this movie as a place to start for the new cinephile .|0
In this film , we 're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who 's had an affair with his workaholic sister, his wife, and his daughter. I think there 's a lot to be learnt from this film that you haven ' t experienced yourself, so we 're here to tell you what we 'd do differently in our relationships. It is really important that you do not rush this process, otherwise this will never work and things will spiral out of control. To me, the movie is not about an affair.|0
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!!|1
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham , AL , which was actually a really fun event to be at. It was a lot of fun, and it’s a cool film that is worth the watch. The movie starts off with a very strange scene, where the main character wakes up in a strange bed in a very strange room, where his brother is dead in the room. So this is like the first scene we see of the main character that we have never seen before.|0
hello all Denver fans ! i could n't agree more with you guys ! This show was so cool and i'm really happy that we got to see so much more of it then we did on last nights show. I don't know if I can put a time for the whole show but i would think that it's between 1-3 or so hours longer. I'm not going to be able to post the whole show but if you want to watch some of it i'll post some of the clips that we have.|0
This film is really really bad , it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at what should be a much better idea. The film has many flaws . The acting , the plots , the cinematography, the special effects . It would be a much better idea if they just filmed it and gave it a theatrical release. I think that it is not the best idea for this story in the world. It is a shame that a film like this should be made for $30 million dollars.|0
I have only seen this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may sound a little bias but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th.|1
OK , last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader 's The Exorcist : The Beginning at the Toronto International Film Festival. For some reason, I have a soft spot for horror movies , but I never thought that this particular film would ever see the light of day. I saw it last night , though, and my opinion of it did not change one bit , it just opened up my mind a little wider to see how this kind of film has been done. The film is about the making of the 1973 film of the same name.|0
"This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, ""Don't bother with us, we're all losers,"" you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. All the usual suspects are here."|1
Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure film, that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing, poor characterisation and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he comes face-to-face with the Devil's Reaper  a demon who collects the Devil's debts i.e. souls  refusing to go to hell just yet, he evades the Reaper and starts a new life in an English monastery.|1
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique take on modernity, it’s also a very personal and intimate portrayal of women’s lives and issues. The show is one of the few shows I actually like to watch because the actors are so strong and talented. The show follows two sisters, Hayriye (Habiba Kavakci-Pamuk) and Hayriye (Gul Duman) as they deal with the consequences of social and family pressures. The series is based off of real life events the two sisters had to face.|0
Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August . I was so inspired and touched . Harry’s love for this character is so powerful in the way it is shown and read . I am not a big Harry Potter fan, but I did have to see this film at some point to show my daughter , and now I am hooked , I want more Harry Potter . You have given me such a wonderful opportunity to read this film for my book group , so thank you. I’m so glad that you are enjoying it so much as I am.|0
'Blade ' would be an extremely above-average comic-book , vampire-hunter action/horror if it were n't for two minor flaws . First off, the artwork in the first issue was, to put it kindly, lackluster . It's obvious from looking at the book's cover that the artist had limited experience working in comic-book territory (he was doing the comic for his own publishing company, though, which is not unusual for self-pubbed books these days). But beyond that, he had little to no idea what he was doing with this material.|0
I really wanted to like this movie . Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of Gary Coopers in To Have And Have Not . The script is excellent , with a great plot twist in the last act . But the plot twists are overused in this type of movie . It should be more like The Maltese Falcon or House of Usher . You get the ending and that is that . But as I mentioned in my review of the previous film . Im glad that the film has made it to DVD , and I look forward to seeing it when the DVD arrives .|0
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life . . . this was an awful waste of my time . . . it felt like the worst movie ever i have watched. It was not entertaining, it was just plain awful . . . i could not believe how they just went ahead and filmed it and then just edited and released it . . . The story of this movie was just . . . well . . . nothing. I felt like they were trying to force me to watch something they wanted to show me .|0
Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said , customs are invented for the sake of dramatic effect, and there's a good chance the people involved may not be who they claim to be, let alone who you think they are. But there's a simple truth that we all accept: the people who go to the trouble and expense to record history aren't making it up. They're making it up about people who have been in the past -- and that's why historical films always seem to turn out the same way.|0
The Calu-what now ? Yeah , I thought it was a stupid name as well . Chris Carter remains blissfully ignorant of the facts surrounding it all . If he did , he'd know it was a total flop. I have been a loyal Calu user since the 1.0 launch. I own all Calus of all kinds and have yet to encounter a game that I would not have purchased from them on the day I opened my wallet. I am one of the biggest Calu collectors in the world! The problem, as I see it, is Calu's pricing scheme.|0
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic . Rosemary 's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by Mark Strong in this tale of a young man on the run who must learn to survive a world of organized criminals as they chase after him. The film opens with Adrian (Mark Strong) getting picked up by a local gangster named Johnny (John Hurt in a cameo role) who is about to have a showdown at a baseball game with his former gang, which has since disbanded. The game quickly degenerates into a bloody one-sided melee between both sides and Johnny's men grab Adrian and hold him hostage.|0
"You thought after ""Traumschiff Surprise"" that German comedy can't get worse? It can. This comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... The real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men."|1
Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal , Stallone , Willis , et al -- manage to survive and thrive in the world they inhabit? You might have noticed, for example, how Seagal and Stallone are in the news constantly. The former is making movies in the U.S.; the latter is in the middle of one, The Expendables. A couple weeks ago, I was watching The Expendables on my computer at home when I realized I wanted to see it again, even if it was only for fun.|0
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults.|1
"Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted for. I was watching the news on TV and thought I’d seen a man with long brown hair go by my office. When he walked into the lobby, I asked my receptionist about him. It turns out he was in the building. “Hi. How are you?” he asked when he sat in the chair next to me. “Hello. What’s up?”

“You have a short hair, like me.”

“Not really.”

“I thought so."|0

If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated.|1
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago but what i want to discuss is how many christians believe that this was a theistic invention or the belief that the sun, moon and stars are God's creation. So if you take a close look at the the bible you see that is what the great men of science were saying and it wasn't theists that changed the world and made it more peaceful. I would love to hear your explanation. I see this argument all the time but it really is a pointless argument.|0
!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees .So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ?|1

This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. It's honestly that bad. I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite.|1
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in GodHe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulations. Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. Just think about it.|1
One of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that it can sometimes lead people to believe that certain things were all over the place at the same time and that it was only the cultural zeitgeist of the 1970s that caused everything that happened that decade. But it certainly was not all over the place or all the same thing. This tendency to believe that everything was all over the place and nothing was the same is why it’s difficult to have coherent conversations about popular culture. The same problems exist when trying to find coherent arguments against popular culture.|0
I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from.|1
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. I also enjoyed it quite a bit when re-watching it to my teenage years. So, it's kind of a nostalgia trip to watch this again. My only complaint is the soundtrack could be a little better. I can't say I ever watched the film in any particular order. I didn't mind watching it twice in order to find out what happened but I don't think I would've liked to watch it again to find out any further plot.|0
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie . However , not more than 5 minutes later , I stopped it and went back to tv and read a book . I don t know , it might just be me , but I get more out of this one than I do most films . So , what do you think of this one ? It is not a bad movie , just not as great as the first one . Not sure I would like it again . So , I am not saying it is the worst film . I really liked this one a lot better than the first .|0
If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then, compared to now.|1
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid . This movie is an insult to every human being on this planet. It is just plain disrespectful. This movie made me think of a scene from The Godfather, where Joe Pesci's character talks about this movie. He's in Italy, and I forget what movie it was but it was some kind of western, and he said something like, ""You know, I've got this film in Rome. You know the one, you know I've got this one in Italy."|0
Forget the lousy acting , that can be forgiven in this sort of film . Or even the terrible , at times boring screenplay . This is the story of the last of the great Indian heroes of World War 1. A man who was an inspiration to every man, woman, and child who had the courage, strength and determination to go into battle on the side of the British Empire. He was one of the unsung heros who fought on the right side. A true patriot and a man of courage. One of the few who went out and sacrificed his life to fight the enemy.|0
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a Hill Billy. Her famous New England enunciation slips through, making lines like, ""I'd better rustle up some Vittles"" pretty ludicrous. She's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of American Entertainment well into the 1940's."|1
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen . However , it is also one of the most entertaining . Based off of a book, written by a former president , of America , it is a drama , political satire , romance , action , comedy , family drama , fantasy , and a very entertaining movie , I can go on all day . It is one of those , if you don't have time to read the book , then this will work as a substitute , and it does .|0
What a cast...and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality. The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. Yeah, I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.The story is not only messy and unlikely, it also isn't exactly terribly original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies.|1
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrayal.There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality.|1
It really is a great film ( after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be having a good time with ). I loved it. I have no qualms with it being a parody, as it seems like the kind of thing I'd like from the original Pink Panther cartoon. It's only a movie that was made to make money, but for a good time. The characters, the cartoon and the actors all blend together and make one of the funniest movies in recent memory.|0
"I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background ""car sounds"" audio just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot."|1
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger.|1
It's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest I've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to America's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..Please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this?|1
When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb , FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. He soon suspects that the man they are being held against their will is actually their former boss, Dr. Marcus Brody. The problem is that Brody is dead, and the only one who can tell him is the man who was supposed to have killed him. With no other choice but to help them out, Martin must decide how far he can trust his former mentor and also whether or not to allow the group to escape.|0
I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction.|1
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park...or if they have it was not very well. None of the characters are what they should be: Fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris' personality. Additionally, a first person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be.|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months . The plot of the story was uninteresting , the characters dull ,the acting lacking . I felt like I had just seen an average low budget horror film . That said ,the special effects were decent , the script a bit weak , the music could be better . I give the film two out of 10 . The only thing I did like about it was the special effects . The special effects were decent , but I can’t really take too much of them seriously .|0
This movie is something horrible . I was laughing all the time . I was forced to stop in some part of the film . I have had enough of terrible movies . This movie is just horrible . I have never laughed at a movie so much I had to stop. There's so many things wrong with this movie , that it makes me sad to know I have wasted money. It is so bad , that I will never ever watch it . I am glad I stopped at the point of the movie , cause I know the ending .|0
This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding Singer'. Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is all about metal.Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll!|1
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who don’t have it all together. And we’re talking about the same girls in different generations, and different places, who live in different environments, and in completely different ways. And they’re the characters, they’re not the characters of the film. (Laughs.) And we’re the characters, we are the film, and we do have everything, but we’re not perfect. They are perfect. [Laughs.]|0
"Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie ""Paul Renauld"" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim)."|1
First of all, I personally adore Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in Russia when I was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. Then I heard nothing about Mr Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it is certainly not a good coming back! Why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul?|1
If this movie would have been in English, all critics would have trashed it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. After the movie I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla!|1
"""De Dominee"" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But that doesn't really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! It lacks substance and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action!"|1
"Follow-up to 1965 's `` My Name Is Barbra '' , and shot in brilliant color , `` Color Me Badd '' (1972). She plays a singer with a big voice and a dreamy demeanor, living in her apartment in San Francisco, with no job, no prospects and no boyfriend. One night she gets invited to an ""after hours"" show by the bandleader ( Jerry Garcia ) who takes her all around the club with him , and she finds out that he is the hottest new star she has ever heard of."|0
"Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of ""personal immediacy"" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie."|1
Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman 's writing ( especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in `` The Dream Hunters '' ) and I think he is one of the most under-rated authors out there, I have to say I think that Neil Gaiman deserves to be considered as more than just an author. I think he is a truly gifted artist. He is also a poet. His stories are masterful, he can weave an entire plot around a few words. When he tells a story, there is a logic behind the story, and there is an emotional core to every character.|0
The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner ' that just aired was at least up to scratch in all the right places. That's not to say there wasn't something to complain about, of course. It wasn't always clear whether Learner was playing the role of the Man himself, or a character within that role, but whatever the character was, he was an excellent actor who did his job right and got the right performance out of his cast. There is a great scene where Learner goes out for the day to find himself an interesting woman.|0
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party , and is in good standing with the Communist Party in the state. He told me of a conversation he had recently with a man at his office who wanted to know why I would work with the Communists. He asked me how long I’d been involved, and when I told him a full decade, he told me that, for many years, the Communists had been the good guys on the streets, and that now he was working with the bad guys, so what did I think about this?|0
"Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement I was able to attend at the ""Rolling Thunder"" screening at the Parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th Dec 2004. Of course the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other movie I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized."|1
I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch.|1
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard . For something made by an eighteen year old , I thought it was very nicely done and I was interested to see it . I liked it for what it was, and for that, I'll give it 2 stars . If you're looking for a well made teen flick , this one's right up there with the best . Not just a great movie, but a great movie that could very easily become a classic. I'm not sure if its a classic yet, but I will give it that much .|0
Ben Marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.The job Ben applies is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house.|1
Secret Service agent Jay Killion ( Charles Bronson ) has been assigned to protect the President-elect 's wife , the President's daughter ( Elizabeth Hurley ) and the President . After Jay is injured in a fire fight he is whisked away from the hospital by the Secret Service to a Washington hospital where he dies as the President is informed that the President will be shot at any moment and there is no time for an autopsy. After his death a grieving President ( Tom Berenger ) is informed that his wife ( Jessica Hecht ) was killed in a plane crash.|0
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can live so well without money?I thought she had a lot of sense but she is a very nice woman and the rest of the family know they are lucky to have her and her husband as well as me and my two boys. We are all well settled and it is not a struggle to live a good life. I have friends that do have a lot of money I just can not understand it. My friends are always on the phone complaining about things that are going on in their lives.|0
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. Well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I don't really see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant.Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other great performances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II, and Hoosiers).|1
"If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, ""Yep. That's exactly right."" It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice."|1
"...""Flight of the Living Dead"" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ""I'm a producer, can'tcha tell?"" Thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because I feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. Apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-DVD release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like Richard ""Three O'Clock High"" Tyson, Erick ""Stargate"" Avari, and Raymond J."|1
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui.|1
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included).|1
I did n't expect much from this movie , it was just one of those movies I thought I 'd like more than I did , and this movie was one of those good ones that didn 't do much for me either way . this is one of those movies you can only really appreciate if you have seen all of the previous installments , and even then you have to admit that not much happens here , there are a couple of cool setpieces , a couple of good jokes and some great character work , but you have to admit it never amounts to much more than that .|0
This representation of the popular children 's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch . I know it is just a kids 's story , but come on , kids would know better than that . The kids should be thinking of themselves when making a movie about the lives of their ' friends . How many kids are really going to sit there for 5 minutes and watch a film like that , or more . This film is a disgrace to the movie makers . I can not wait for it to be released on DVD by Disney . The movie will be a bomb , and it is already out in the world .|0
"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. ""The Mad Monster"" is no exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. The filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level."|1
"Found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown,(Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. In one scene as Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed),""Dead Sexy"",01."|1
"Of course I am going to think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also. I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. The Director said ""It is taking to long, what would you do Gower."""|1
I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was OK, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside US. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. The screenplay is horrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles.|1
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the most underused original SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't suit Junior in the least.|1
"Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely under-used and has SO much more to offer besides ""Agent Mulder"" (although I'm a huge fan of that series too), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows love never dies... it's with you forever."|1
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse , the acting , or the CGI. We dont even get to talk about the story of course , its all about one man trying to figure out why he has to go through life without knowing why he was made to live this way . There is a big twist in the ending that will leave you guessing till the end as to whats going on. The movie is very interesting with lots of twists and one liners. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the editing.|0
One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.|1
I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. There's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this.|1
Bad , bad , movie , so bad it is worth watching . As long as you watch this movie , you ll get to know a little bit about who she is . This movie is very very very bad . A very very very very bad movie . Very very bad , very very bad, very very bad . Very very very bad , very bad, so bad i will never see it again. very bad, very very bad , very bad. very bad, so bad, very bad , very bad, so bad .|0
Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence.|1
While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged.|1
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I would think you could get that from the title. Also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when. Only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. Good luck finding it at your local store though. I doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution.|1
In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris' cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.|1
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel . Kennedy was a well known good writer/director/producer during the early days of TV, and it was not until about 1960 that the western got a second generation of directors and producers. As a kid in the 1930s it seemed to me as if a good movie had been made every week and there was an abundance of it. You could just walk into the drive-in with your friends and find a movie playing (or better yet, watching on a giant TV screen).|0
I mean really , really , REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment . I do n't think they could pull it off as well as they have in the last 2 months , but let me tell you , you will see a great movie on the big screen , and you can tell by the trailer that you will be glad you paid for it and your friends did too! I will try and get some pictures at the theatre to post when I can, so check back soon if you're interested and let me know if there are pics. Thanks!|0
Oh , Yawn . Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even if the movie doesn’t end up working out . This one was made in 1998 but I remember seeing it and thinking, what the hell were they thinking? I was right, I don’t know why it got made or what it’s trying to convey but I was wrong. It was poorly done but it didn’t suck , at least it didn’t to me. It did suck , it really sucked, and when you’re wrong , your wrong.|0
The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations.Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one.|1
Okay , so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again ! ' Week in , week out , month in month out , it really is like that . In fact , one can argue that since the last year or two there has been not much new in the way of 'news' of this type . In other words , its a series of rehashes . And this time the topic is not of the day - but , this time it is not the month or even year . It is , this time , a topic that is way out of date !|0
Okay , it 's a movie for children , and it 's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy. And that's ok , I don't mind too. I can appreciate the movie for it's very good story. It has been years since the first one was made and a lot of people have taken the same movie and have made changes, adding more to the story, adding things to the plot and also adding more characters to the plot. But that is where it is at and that is what a good story is.|0
"As embarrassing as it is to admit , I was listed as production manager on this film ... my very first one (and I was thrilled and honored to do it). Here is the script by my friend and ""production manager"":

“Carmen, you were there on the night they murdered the three people in the room you’re looking for. Don’t bother to tell me what it was. Just tell me where they took him.”

It was a summer night, early evening. The air still. The lights still."|0
"MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a ""light, sports comedy"" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. (Some of the superficial ""sports comedy"" results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how ""basa-boru"" is played in Japan.)"|1
"Wrestlemania 6 , is an entertaining Wrestlemania , if not an entirely successful one . The Ultimate Challenge , is the event , but it’s also the Wrestlemania main event . The main event is the one to remember . If you missed it , here’s the video recap from WrestleCrate . In this recap, we have a few thoughts on the event , and the future of Wrestlemania :

Ronda Rousey and Johny Hendricks put the best performance of their careers at WrestleMania 6 and were rewarded with a decisive victory over Asuka and Bayley."|0
and there are not many in cinema history . `` Rouge '' seems to be a bit of a hope-theatre-type movie, which may have been good for this film's production. But it will take more than hope to get it in the cinema. The audience should have more of a reason to attend the movie than they did. In fact I think it might be best to wait until the first film, `` A Night At The Opera'' is released. I'm glad I was not wrong about `` Rouge. '' I have to say that I liked it much better than I thought I would like it.|0
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s -- films so ridiculous and silly that they seem like parodies of their own genre. But I've never actually seen one I liked. I think I've seen everything, but even I don't know which films I have seen and which I haven't. I'm hoping this list will help put a name on the unknown films I've never even heard of. Note: Some of these films were made in black and white; others in color. All are on DVD, though most are presented in the original theatrical aspect ratio.|0
Breathtaking at it 's best , intriguing at it 's worst , Francis Ford Coppala 's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' has its detractors and fans. It has become the quintessential Vietnam War documentary. But there are other works by the same director which have more in common with this one. One of Coppala's first and most iconic films was 'The New World' (1959) in which he made a film about a utopian world without poverty and war, but in one of the first films about a world without the need to go to war, 'Apocalypse Now' is more in keeping with a world without war .|0
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism , birds , birds and more birds . Only 1 piranha . Nice to watch the movie when there are piranha around the boat . So we can watch the movie and enjoy the moment . The movie was a hit with the kids and grown ups . We are enjoying it now while walking at the beach . This movie is great for tourists and a lot of them love it because of the beautiful and beautiful beach and the beautiful scenery. We have been swimming a lot since we arrived here and this movie makes us want to go back to the beach more and more.|0
This is one of the most laughably bad films I've ever seen. I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was connected with making it. It doesn't have anything going for it. There is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project.|1
This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975.|1
FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team , and begin to suspect a sinister cover-up. But what exactly is at the heart of that mystery and what is the truth about the missing scientists? Mulder and Scully go back in time to investigate what really went down in the oil drilling operation on Alaska's north coast, where a strange and deadly explosion took place. But what happened to the missing scientist team? And why did Scully's ex-boyfriend show up on her doorstep one day and ask for Scully's help in getting his daughter back?|0
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters . This is CITY OF LOS ANGELES POLICE , NOT SAN FRANCISCO POLICE. I am sure you will all be glad to know that I am a proud Los Angeles Police Department (or LAPD) officer and have never had an encounter with San Francisco Police in the past. I have a great working relationship with the LAPD and respect and appreciate that they have a professional police force that does a terrific job in providing the highest quality law enforcement service to the residents and businesses of San Francisco.|0
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach . When I watch a movie with a story like this I feel a sense of shame. This film is a disgrace . I would love to see this movie put on a big screen and for everyone to see it . I know I'm just being a little bitter and jealous because I want to see this movie myself , but still I can't see this movie being a movie . It's a movie that makes you cry and you know it's not going to change your life , that's all .|0
This great film never showed up in my town, so actually I didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. The tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so I hope to see it once again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it, if you ever have the chance.|1
Being a former MST3k watcher, even I found this movie unwatchable. The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow--they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a couple of bucks and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent pieces of film-making I've ever seen and that's saying something.|1
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place.|1
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.)|1
CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e.|1
"I have just seen Today You Die . It is bad , almost very bad.1 ) The direction and editing is bad, so is the writing .2) the characters are horrible. There are only 3 so-called ""good ones"" in the whole story. I don't want to tell how they are really , but their behavior is not realistic. They are not like the real world people.3) There are some people I know who have read it , who tell me they can't finish it because they don't like it. That is their problem not mine."|0
As I said , sometimes low budget is good . You get to see a good movie without a lot of money but sometimes that's not the best thing. If the movie is better than what a few people say is good , then everyone is going to say it is good even though there is no audience for it . the movie is great but it's the people who think its great who are wrong . if i had to give a list , i would give it to you first , i would start with this , and i would end with this .|0
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has found his destiny. He’s as much of a romantic as his father was, too. His first kiss is as tender and sweet, as well as a little rueful. A lot of what he is going to learn has to do with love and loyalty. Even so, he’s not entirely sure if he really wants to go there. He’s about to be the youngest captain ever.|0
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago , and it remains one of my all-time faves ! It’s a great movie that will not be to everyone's taste , but the plot is unique , and it will bring you to the point where you think to yourself , ‘ Wow ! I have seen that type of movie before!’ And so you go back and you go to the movie house and you sit back , and it’s a great movie to watch , even though it's not for everyone .|0
For this movie , based off of a TV show , and a serious finale . I thought that it was very good and I enjoyed it a lot and it was worth watching . The movie was good , but a bit overrated . I thought the whole movie was very well acted and had great scenery . The only thing I thought it needed was some action scenes . And it didn't have too many of those and they were very short and only came in the climax . I really don't know . I just didn't feel like it had too much action .|0
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I watched the manga review in a magazine, I thought it was maybe interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity.OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series have an standard. But as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical based upon the Christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. It features some demons and stigmata scenes... Totally nonsense.|1
I finally watched the third film in Mehta 's trilogy : `` Fire '' . To begin , I 'd like to tell you how I became aware of the movie : it was on TV the day after it was aired on CNN. I did not pay attention to the movie. I saw that there had been a new release on the same day on VHS, and I did not think anything more about it. But later that night, I watched the film and was completely mesmerized. The plot is about the life and the death of Bollywood actor , Ashok Kumar in a small town.|0
A small-town schoolteacher ( Geena Davis ) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a different person in the past. Now a widow living in the idyllic town of Arcadia, New Mexico, she's got everything she needs to forget her past. Unfortunately, she has no idea exactly when the events of her past happened or how to forget them. Her past is about to catch up to her in an all-out assault from the past, and she'll soon discover that she may not be able to survive another memory-erasing experience.|0
"The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability ""to take fragments and make them whole"" affects everyone within her sphere."|1
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings.|1
This movie had very few moments of real drama . After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral into an inane mess that would make a child cry. What I actually liked was the movie's characters. They did not get enough screen time to develop into the people they would become in the future, but I could forgive that for the lack of screen time. The acting was not very good at all, but I guess that's a good thing, since there wasn't much to be said about that.|0
Wow... I suspected this one to be bad... But now I find myself just at a loss for words... Honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...I'll try to say something anyway...This truly is one unique gem. One of the worst kind.Lash La Rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a Toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt.It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone.|1
As an ex ( nuclear ) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie ( even exceeding the movie submarine movie from the 80’s) . I watched it as a child I was about 13 yrs old . I’ve never seen anything like it . It has all the great things of the original . It is full of adventure and has great plot twists . It’s one of those “ I know what I’m doing and I am going to make it” movies . I can tell you exactly what will happen before the movie starts .|0
"I'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with ""Go Fever""."|1
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis, he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing.|1
Dr. Marnie Bannister ( Magda Konopka ) is a horribly disfigured woman . When one of her colleagues discovers a mysterious scar on her face, she must decide: is it the face of a serial killer or a medical miracle? As she struggles to face the world, Magda begins to question herself: can she trust her doctor, or her faith? Can she believe her heart? And when the unthinkable happens, what is the point of believing in something so far from the truth? Can she save a child from death? And what will it cost Magda to accept the truth, if she ever discovers it?|0
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended , I was seething with anger. Why was the director such a dick about it? I watched the movie 3x a week after it first came out and had no idea about the issues it faced. It made my life better, it made the movies better, it made my experience as a movie goer better, it made me think I should make more movies, it taught me things that I didn’t know and I didn’t know what it was that I had learnt.|0
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film , the other two being Ozu and Satō. Born in Chōshi, Kanagawa, he graduated from Keio High School, after which he entered the Tokyo School of Theatre. He then went on to study theatre at Tokyo University's department of drama, graduating at the top of his class in 1925. He won the Japan Art Academy Award in 1928, and in 1933 the Noh Drama Scholarship, the highest honour bestowed on a Japanese performer. In the same year he became a professor at the Tokyo College of Music and Dance.|0
Apparently this movie was based on a true story . I 'm not sure how accurate it is , though , I think I 'm a bit disappointed . I'm not sure what happened to this guy , but he has to be in his 60s by now , and he really is an interesting man . It's the first time I read about this guy, and now I have to see this movie . I don't want to ruin the ending , though . I'm not a fan of the book , which is not surprising . The movie is based on the book of a different kind .|0
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. Mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.SPOILER--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated.Plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee, and others. The apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style.|1
Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology.|1
Now here is a movie that does something that has n't been done in a long time . It take's a standard issue horror film and gives it an edgy twist that is sure to get people talking and making them look at your movie. This is an awesome movie that takes a standard genre and takes it to another level. As a movie reviewer it's my job to bring something to the movie review table. I like to give my opinion on all things horror. I like a good gore and if you're not afraid to go there in your movie then I'm happy to be your reviewer.|0
"As a rule, I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them. I made no exceptions with ""Tart"", doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.It failed for a number of reasons. Firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category. Thirdly, the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling, it really was."|1
This film 's a big bore . It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start . The dialog is a bit weak & the characters weak . The music is ok , but is lacking a bit . The climax has nothing to do with the rest of the film . This film is a failure . It is a very predictable film with a lot of dialogue. The dialogue is the best part of it, but the whole thing is very slow paced and has no energy. The characters are all the same, and that's what I dislike about a lot of this film.|0
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', Poland could play the role it did in WWII, being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna.|1
This was such a great film . It was done with such beautiful design , such symmetry . I love this film so much , i think you should remake this movie . This is my first review . I am from Pakistan . This movie was made in 2008. I watched it in 2009, but it was not in English . I watched this movie in Hindi. So this movie was not released in India. But now in 2015 this movie is released in India. Now you should download this film in Hindi. I like this movie so much.|0
I am very open minded . I watch all kinds of programs to the end ... good or bad ... I have to find a program which I can not live without I have to see what is on . There is a reason they call them tv shows. They tell the truth. I can see right through all of you. There are people on here who think they know more than they really know. What they are really doing is trying to be something they can't be. There are people who watch tv all day who don't know anything about anything.|0
This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt, ring true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even though it is right for the story, because I had already come to care about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber work all around, even to the use of just the right sound and/or music to advance the story.|1
Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's, there's too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla&The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. Matches.|1
OK , I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but I did see the movie , so it is not my fault, I think. The movie is just the movie. I think the only part of the movie worth watching for are the last 20 min of it. I do agree that if it was not for the music in the beginning, and the first 20 min, the movie would be a waste of time and money. I thought the movie was really good overall, and the music really added a great deal of entertainment to the film.|0
Is this a good movie ? No , certainly not . But for Jolie lovers it 's must-have . Her body , her voice , her hair and eyes , her grace and her talent made her the perfect actress to play such a complicated character as Cleopatra 's wife . It 's also amazing how Jolie has made the role of a Cleopatra so believable , not only in appearance but also in acting skills . I don ' t expect to see any Hollywood movie that 's more authentic , more real , more realistic than Cleopatra and Cleopatra 's Revenge .|0
`` Rouge '' is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own . It is n't really a companion to Rouge, but it has much in common with it . And if you know anything about the Rouge books, then you won't be surprised . The story begins when a man comes back home from a war to find his little daughter gone. She's been kidnapped and her mother's in the hospital, barely alive . Now, the man is faced with the most horrifying task he could ever imagine: to find his kidnapped daughter, rescue her, and make sure she's okay.|0
This is easily one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long long time ( and I 've seen quite a few). I don 't mean that in the sense of the movie, the film, the movie 'cause it was okay-ish, but I don't like the idea of people like that in real life. There are only two things that bother me about this movie. One of the two things is that this movie has no redeeming value in my eyes, as it's like the first time when I read a novel that was so awful, and it had no redeeming value whatsoever.|0
I'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I could've done without the female nudity but I'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!)|1
"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa delle anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad."|1
"Okay, so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. ""Hell Ride"" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general."|1
First things first , I am by no means a picky movie watcher . I 'm not one of those guys who will only go for films with good story lines and great acting . All I want to see is something fresh and new , which makes the whole viewing experience a pleasure and gives me a new reason to re watch a film after watching it for the third time . And I 'm usually willing to change my opinion on something , if my initial reaction is something new that I have discovered in the last few days .|0
"This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see ""Free Enterprise"" instead."|1
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable."|1
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance).|1
I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out.|1
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half . Few scenes in the film are well constructed, but the plot itself is so predictable that it would be a better movie if it was a remake of some classic movie instead of a remake of a horror movie . The whole concept of the movie is laughable . A group of friends head to a remote cabin to watch some horror film but they don’t know that they are in a very dangerous place , and the group is going to be the prey .|0
"Nothing about this movie is any good. It's a formulaic predictable ""romantic comedy"" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. In other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors."|1
A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People begin to wonder if they did it. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. The cops speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to trial. They are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented.|1
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice.|1
The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat.|1
I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a Bruce movie for you watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear.|1
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this film. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. Maybe this movie isn't Academy Award material, but it sure is feel good material.|1
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature footage, bad acting - Aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well off each other. There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I do say so myself.The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day.|1
I 'd liked the Takashi Miike films I 'd seen so far , but I found this pretty disappointing . in fact , I felt that , even if the acting was a bit more overrated than usual , I ' d be happy to see a film like this over a year after I 've seen it and , of course , it 's a movie that can only be called a rip-off ! it ' s a movie that 's so boring and so stupid that the director is in danger of turning in to an Oscar candidate .|0
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated after being hit by cars. The plot follows a group of teens who become lost in a small town after getting their cars smashed into in a car wreck. They then become stranded with no idea how to find the others. After they meet up, they realize that they are not alone, as their souls are separated and there is no way to bring back the others. As the film progresses, they each discover that the soul of the person they lost is trapped inside of their car.|0
Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, Emma, and daughter, Annie.Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly.But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons.|1
It's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It's not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this one is a turkey.|1
Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? Did you not see that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The acting was fine, sure. But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. Things happen, but that's it.|1
First, what is really great about this movie: - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - Horrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - Very annoying character Melissa.|1
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique , brilliant , and very twisted at a minimum . Well I guess if you judge it by the last movie , I’m sure that it is very twisted . I mean I saw it and it’s probably one of my favorites in his whole career . And the last movie was awesome . So , I decided to give it a watch . And from what I saw , Park’s movies are very twisted . He always creates a different kind of story . And I loved his twist at the end of his movies .|0
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield , I can not claim to have enjoyed this movie as much as I would have hoped. I have no complaints with the direction of the film. It is good enough, even in its weaknesses. I do however have a problem with the screenplay. I have not read it, nor have I seen it. I am therefore going on what I know from other reviews. I do not want to be accused of bias. So here is what I know of the film. I have no intention of discussing the plot.|0
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr. ).|1
Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. Upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better film than,The 6th Sense(8.2), Saving Private Ryan(8.4), Lord of the Rings( 8.7),Godfather(9.5), Gladiator(8.1) and Dawn of the Dead ( 7.8) to name a few.|1
There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made a science fiction story like this before. The movie was so imaginative and exciting, that the audience couldn't wait to see what the final product would be like. After watching the last scene, I didn't even know how the story could possibly continue. This is a terrific motion picture that needs to be seen by everyone. It definitely should be seen by everyone! This film is the perfect example of what not to do.|0
So, it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people--eye candy. But that's about it...a string of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy?|1
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish!. Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget.|1
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special . The acting and camera work seemed to be very professional . The film did seem to move at a different rate than the books and seemed to take more time . It was only after watching the first three quarters of the film and getting a feeling that there was something going on that I got to read the comments made by those that saw the films. It is always a shame when a movie fails to live up to its publicity. This film did not disappoint in the way it should .|0
Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.The cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme.|1
In his feature film debut ` Yellow , ' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood 's portrayal of Asian-Americans by providing the first true account of Asian-American actors within the studio system, from being cast to getting cast. He examines how a number of film industries, including Warner Bros. , MGM , Fox , Paramount and Walt Disney , use Asian-American actors in film, and he looks at the role of Asian-Americans in American pop culture by looking at how Asians have been used as an exotic exotic in Hollywood, and in pop culture, from television and movies to comics and television.|0

Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black.|1
This is a joke , right ? This ca n't be a real film ? It 's not even a bad joke ? It is not even a bad joke ? This joke is funny ? Is this joke real ? What is a real joke ? Not to say that this joke is in the least bit original, but it does make sense. I don't really get the point of this film. It is funny and well written, but I don't care about the joke. I'm a film fan but that's why I watch film, not for this particular joke.|0
Okay , now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from . I do believe they can be exciting sometimes but most times I would rather watch a really good cop show like Law and Order , NYPD , Homicide and all those other ones . In my mind , the cop is always at the scene , the suspect always has something to hide , the detectives always have their own agenda , the victims always have a secret to hide . So , the whole thing is always boring and nothing ever happens . And I am sick of all these boring cop shows .|0
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3), this is fast-paced, in your face, rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken.The story lines are spurious, at best, but it's deliberate, as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters.|1
In Moscow , the young couple Veronika ( T. Samojlova ) and Boris ( Aleksey Batalov ) are in deep love. They want to build a life together in order to get married. However, Boris feels the urge to leave Russia and emigrate. So, in a last attempt to win her heart, he proposes the idea of emigrating together to Berlin , where he will meet a German woman. Veronika accepts Boris’ proposal but soon finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her with his secretary. They spend the night together, and Boris decides to leave Russia for Berlin.|0
"Many believe this movie is a baseball movie . Such people are disappointed because it 's about a baseball player, and in the baseball world, there is no ""baseball movie"". This baseball movie is not a baseball movie . Now, there was a baseball movie. But it's not a baseball movie because:

1) The baseball movie does not have to deal with baseball. 2) This movie is about the real baseball player who does not play in the baseball movies. So, we have a baseball movie with a baseball player. Who is this baseball player?"|0
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see . It started of as a little movie about an old guy who goes out on a trip to visit a woman he met on a ferry. When they get to her cabin he realizes he has forgotten his wallet and in his haste he leaves her a note to come back and get it . So he returns and gets the wallet . But when he goes back out on the ferry again to leave the note , he realizes she hasn't gotten it .|0
There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . He could effortlessly switch from comedy to tragedy with equal aplomb. And I can’t remember a single scene he did not portray with great skill. He was the perfect man for this role. In fact, I would go so far as to say that he is the perfect choice to play this part. He does everything he can to protect his wife, but he just doesn’t want to be a hero and has no intention of letting it happen.|0
"Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to get through. That's another comment in the making.But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the DVD. It included a game of memory, which asks the player/viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark. However, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding)""it's mate."""|1
"Thursday June 15 , 9:30pm The EgyptianSaturday June 17 , 11:00am The Egyptian '' He spent most of his life in New York before moving to California in the 1970s. It was during that decade that he was exposed to a diverse array of cultures including jazz music from Africa, South America and Asia. It was in New Orleans that he was introduced to the world of music. ""He loved New Orleans, loved jazz, loved everything about that place -- it was the real thing. The real New Orleans -- the sound of it"" He said."|0
I have n't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made ! Talk about being out of your mind. Well, I thought, I will have to get up early in the morning on Thursday. I was going to go to the office and prepare a report. But I had a feeling that something more important was happening in the town. So I got up earlier than expected. I checked out the local news papers, saw the report, and I felt that I had to see what it was about before I did anything else.|0
"The ""silver screen"" gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy, humor and lust for life. The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to ""live each day as if it's your last"" and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!"|1
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named ""luther"". Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local Kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.Luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY tv show gets naked."|1
I had to get this movie , since it did n't come to where I live . I waited patiently for 3 years to watch it , finally I did . Great movie, it had a lot of action , drama and romance . It was a film worth the watch. I have never heard of the film, but I am very glad that you have recommended it. I have never been that attracted to movies, but have really liked this movie in particular. The plot was very interesting and I liked how it was told with different characters and scenes.|0
"You know, this is one of those ""Emperor's New Clothes"" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts. Some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius."|1
"""Valley Girl"" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of ""Romeo and Juliet."" It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for ""Fast Times,"" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure."|1
Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot . There she is met by a young woman who takes her under her wing and offers to help her in every way possible. The two soon fall in love with each other, and they decide that she will be the woman that they will be able to live without. A few years pass and Gemser finds herself back in America, but this time she's married with a baby on the way. As her marriage begins to fall apart she begins to see her life in a different way.|0
First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience.But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic: - No second mask attached to the oxygen.|1
"GOLD RAIDERS ( 1951 ) A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges ( including Shemp Howard at this point ) in it . I don't remember the name of this film or this company. This might have been released by Warner Brothers Pictures as a ""feature length cartoon"". This was the last film to be directed by Tex Avery, and was made at the same time that the three Stooges was on Broadway. I don't have a set time that this film started shooting, so it may not have been the very last film made, but it was definitely made at this time ."|0
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'White Aborigine' music).|1
I didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. It was a particularly great scene when Feck(Dennis Hopper) and John(Daniel Roebuck) are talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why.|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. Like one of those so-so episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has Something Important To Say.You'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. However, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!|1
I did n't know what to expect from this hugely popular ( and hilarious ) Swedish comedy & satire team. They were amazing. They have a unique and wonderful way of getting inside and making jokes on themselves. They always had a funny line to say, no matter the subject or situation. I enjoyed this show a lot, especially the first hour. It made you laugh out loud. They are definitely the best comic team I ever saw on TV, ever. I really look forward to watching them on any other show. There is no one else like them, period.|0
I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered . The show had a lot going for it, a young cast, a fresh concept, and a good cast to go along with. I can't help but feel like it's a TV show that is a complete mess and the whole concept seems like it's a huge mistake. I just can't get behind this show. I can't tell you how much it annoys the crap out of me. I think it may be due to the fact the characters are very unrealistic.|0
This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.The characters are vivid and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novella. Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters.|1
I hope this isn't a portent of things to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst.|1
This film did not excite me . While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the multiplex that had just opened up nearby . So I went to check out this film . What a disappointment . It was only about 2 hours long and I couldn't really get interested in the plot of any of it's scenes . The writing was bad , the characters and the story lacked depth . There was no chemistry between the main characters and the chemistry between the main character and her girlfriend was not believable .|0
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. Davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St.|1
"I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with the gratuitous sex although I admit the rotational style of bonking was something I had not seen (nor experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The ""Oakville Tribune"" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario???)"|1
This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part).|1
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya . I do not like his singing too . But his songs are a treat to dance to . I have not heard one bad song in his whole career which is good to watch . He makes songs in a style that most do not even know how to write in . He can sing and perform and he is a natural entertainer. His songs are always in the mood of a love story . I always look forward to the show . His songs are different from most of the singers around . His voice is so good .|0
The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this.|1
"A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in ""Double Indemnity,"" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher."|1
Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut . Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry that can make a romantic comedy work . It's not easy to find, but it's a skill that this couple displays in the best way possible . For those that think they know who David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are: Don't do it again. This film is an all-out laugh riot that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey from the depths of the human psyche to the depths of the human soul . It's a journey you won't forget in a hurry.|0
"Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this ""film"", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. And where did they find these ""actresses""?"|1
"Yes , I spelled that right . This movie is so predictable , the actual word needs additional letters to be correctly spelt by you so i can read it . This is the movie i was looking for . Sigh . this movie is not worth the time . by

If you get a chance, go to see the film. There's not really any way that it can go wrong. The writing is good but the director and actors really don't have a lot of ideas to follow. There's no story to follow and so the movie is really boring."|0
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/."|1
Chick Flick ? Of course .... Been done before ? Many times .... Predictable ? Yes ..... Worth watching ? No ... But it is interesting .... I did not watch it for many reasons and I still have not finished watching it ... It would be interesting to see if he has anything new and interesting in the next 3 hours. I may go to it just to see something different ... It seems like he is not happy with what he has done ? He does not seem like a man that is satisfied .... What he does seems a bit self serving ....|0
One of my all-time favourite movies . Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time . If I had to pick one movie for my list of the best ,this one would definitely be in the running . As a kid ,I always had a deep passion for this movie . So when I saw the DVD edition for the movie ,this one has to be number one in my top movies list. I just had to watch this movie many times . This movie is based on the story of a little girl who lived with her mother in a small apartment.|0
"Sony Pictures Classics , I 'm looking at you ! Sony 's got the rights to Harry records -- you know they do. Well, I 'm trying to decide on a Harry record of my own. First of all, let's see if you're as hot as they say you are. Harry 's first album, ""Songs Of Faith and Love"" is hot stuff. I 'll have to get this on the stereo and give it the ol ' ear test, but the vocals are terrific, and there is a lot of new stuff on here that I think is great."|0
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move.|1
"The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and Bernstein's rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts ""II"" and ""III"" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces."|1
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated.|1
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play.|1
By Jove , what an unholy mess ! Revenge , incestuous love , mechanical games-like fighting , ceaseless and utterly meaningless ‘dance-fights’ by the women and children of ‘Romeo and Juliet’! What an unspeakable, bloody mess ! Now, if you really must see what this ‘dance-fighting’ thing means , you might like to try out the original film. You won’t find a better time to do it , you will see. That is unless you’ve already seen it. That is unless you’ve watched ‘Romeo and Juliet’ at least twenty times or more .|0
There is a difference between a `` film , '' and a `` movie . '' A film , regardless of what it is, is a motion picture. A movie is a collection of films. To be a film, a film must have a screenplay, be directed by two or more people, be produced, and be shown on a movie theater or in a movie theater. To be a movie, a film doesn't have to be directed by a single director. It can also be produced by only one or two people.|0
Philistines beware , especially American ones ! This has all the elements you 'll hate - a langorous approach to politics, a general disdain for facts and figures, a contemptuous attitude toward those who disagree, and an anti-foreigner bias. But most of all, this book is an anti-Semitic manifesto , and I can't be bothered to read it for myself! As a Jew , I was appalled to find that the authors were anti-Semitic . That, I believe, is why so many Jews found the book to be offensive in the first place.|0
Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my man I would never disrespect. Those Mobsters were spooky. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt u if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why?|1
"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from ""evidence"" to ""violence,"" I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money."|1
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in the late fall of 2002. I had heard many great stories about it since I was a little girl, but now I was able to hear it from the very first screening. Now that i am back in New England, I think about it a lot. I think of it now as I sit in my studio, trying to perfect the very simple technique that made this movie so brilliant and so powerful.|0
I rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.The plot... there is no plot. Everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog could've done better. The special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. And the cheesy lines.... I mean, why even bother? The only credit I can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes.|1
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I too, had liked Russell and Pare ""back in the old days"" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I did return to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded."|1
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career .... As I had seen this movie many times ... And it's my favourite movie of vijay. I never thought of not watching it ...I just started watching it. It was one of my favourite movies that I never expected. It's a very emotional and funny movie. I was waiting for this movie to come to the theatres. This movie is based on the true events that took place on 23rd December 1979. It also has a sequel which you can check out if you like.|0
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I ca n't understand why, I was under the impression there was a lot of hype about this movie. I must say that this movie has alot of promise, and I really hope this is a good movie. As far as I can gather, the story revolves around a young man who is looking for his father's killer, he has to find him before the police do. He finds his father and his father reveals his name to the young man who was the one who killed his father.|0
OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That's the case here.|1
"Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman (Robert Ames) as the ""front"" even though she is the brains.Of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running everything and teaching him class. She loves the dope, but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos."|1
"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow ""transplant"" donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever."|1
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union , Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the Gulag to create a work force of over 50 million. It is said that around one quarter of the Soviet Union's population lived under the Soviet system of mass incarceration. Gulag was the collective term for the prisons and concentration camps established to imprison, punish, and exterminate the political opponents of the Communist Party during the Great Purge. Its name was derived from the Slavic word for a small house, gula, or from gulas, meaning 'gutters', since the cells had no windows.|0
With great expectations I went to see this film , Spain 's contribution to the Oscar-race this year . Part of my disappointment comes from not seeing a much loved actress in the leading role . Instead the lead went to a very young man, one of the best actors I've ever seen and I was disappointed that he wasn't given more than 4 or 5 minutes of screen space . I was also disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for best film , it was just a very well made and well-written film with great performances by all and a good score .|0
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out.|1
This movie is simply bad. First of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. It leaves you with questions when you're finished. Sometimes that's OK, but not in this case.The acting is nothing to write home about. The adults does a OK job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was worst. Well, to be honest I'm not sure that was the lead role. Never quite figured who this movie was about.|1
It 's just when a band tours , and only has one original member . It 's not the same as if they 're not touring , or have two or three new members. But it does happen. In fact , there are more bands with a single member that tour than any other kind of group. But , if the band has one or two new members , it is more like a new band . I guess that's the way I see it. I don't understand how a band with one or two new members and the same amount of time to do tour can become a totally different band.|0
A film , first and foremost , should be good storytelling . It should be entertaining - and entertaining does not always mean exciting - but it should draw you in and make you smile. A film like this, one that doesn't let you down, might not have a single laugh in the entire hour and a half you watch it . But that's what this film was, and it didn't disappoint . There are some elements of it that should not be taken too seriously , some things you just can't laugh at .|0
"One of the reviewers here wrote : `` Good acting , good special effects , greatlocation . Even better ending. But it wasn't a movie I was expecting . It was like something from a comic book. It was fun but I didn't care.``

I have to say, that I didn't expect it either. I didn't expect any of this. And I'm glad to say I didn't get any of that either. It's an enjoyable, entertaining and entertaining movie. As I said, it's one I enjoyed."|0
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view and test this game. I played the beta with my son yesterday, and we both agree this is a very cool game that we can all enjoy (except that my son can't play anything longer than like 5 hours). I don't know if this is a good game or a very good game, but it's going to blow me away because I don't know how I was going to play the beta.|0
* * * SLIGHT SPOILERS * * * This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit. When the movie opened, we learned that there was a conspiracy. We then learned that the conspiracy was actually just a cover for a terrorist group to take over the world. And now, we are told that it's all just a ruse. There was never a terrorist threat. The world wasn't on the brink of total destruction. The world isn't in danger at all. There isn't a nuclear power plant. There isn't even one nuclear reactor.|0
David Cronenberg 's ` eXistenZ ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism . It addresses the question of why we exist . The film is a commentary on how to live in the age of science , in a world in which life-or death-denying technology is taking over from religion , in an age of global chaos . There are two stories in this film . The first is what Cronenberg reveals on the opening page of his script. We are on the planet Ararat in the last days of its life as a habitable world. We have seen it pass through five stages in the evolution of a human culture .|0
"I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. It barely matters because the dire acting, clichéd camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-Shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. ""Get thee out of here!"" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain."|1
As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs , `` Gag me out the door . '' I would be happy to be of help, as I know just where she would want me to be. She would want to feel the pleasure of being able to do the most of herself in all the time she has at her desk to her fullest. I would enjoy doing it even though I know she would hate the way it made my feet feel in my stocking feet. I would not be allowed to do it in public. It would be better if it were to be done discreetly.|0
This was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless.|1
Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses . The movie is very funny and the acting is very good . But I still don’t agree with the premise of the movie . The movie has a good message about how our society has become too materialistic . And the main character seems very selfish . I’ve never seen a romantic comedy like this one . It tells you how to get a relationship to work for you . The way to succeed in a relationship is quite simple , you just have to make love with your partner .|0
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit But when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene. i don even see why you would go to see it on your own.|1

I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years . I had never seen this adaptation , so when the movie opened I decided to watch it . . . because I am a Jane fan … . . . but what I ended up watching was a little disappointing . The only reason why I liked this adaptation was because of the casting . I can’t recall seeing anyone who I could even remotely identify with what Austen had written . I am not even certain that her characters are my sort of people .|0
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the TV show. So far, so good. There's a great deal that makes this movie work. The cast is a joy to behold: Robert Loggia does his best to be Robert De Niro (as I've come to expect, he's the most charismatic of the bunch, but he's very good in the role), as well as the cast that brings this great story of two men who've grown apart. The acting from each of the leads is also superb.|0
When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV . I just watched the last 5 minutes of the show because I felt like I was going insane . I was watching HAIR on a Sunday after church because I had just received my confirmation and my husband and I were taking the children to see the movie . We were going in and out of the theater for 30 minutes or so and when we got to the last five minutes I thought I couldn’t take it anymore because my eyes were streaming . It was like I had just been on stage during an audition .|0
I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. They just don't make shows like this anymore, do they?|1
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews.When Moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this.|1
"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his ""wedding."" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The ""joke"" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his ""bits and pieces."""|1
There wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie but that's about it.- The movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.- My understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age.|1
This was it ! i would have never expected the ending if i did n't already know the behind the scene of the story. (I thought i already knew all there is to know about this one, but reading this one will give a completely new perspective.) I don't know if you are interested in this one, but i wanted to tell you in case it is. I really liked the way the author described and showed the world. (I am a fan of books where all the people have an amazing and unique way of describing their world and i really like this in this one.)|0
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the '90s (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."""|1
This film has it 's heart in the right place , but unfortunately , it is n't much of a movie at all . I think the main problem with the film has something to do with how much time and effort they have to spend on a plot . The film has some good moments and the acting and writing is at a good level but the story is really weak and it just ends up being an average thriller film .The film has really good and well written scenes , and some really good acting and music but the plot is weak .|0
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. I've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.The acting's all good and the direction very solid. The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?|1
Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year-olds (and I) loved it. Kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it.|1
"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.The cast is nice."|1
This movie is so bad , they would n't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store . I'm sorry to say , but it is bad , and it's so bad , you can't trust anything that comes from Paramount . But , I must admit , I love the ending . It is sooo funny . And when you think it's really bad , but you keep watching it anyway , you end up loving it . I'm pretty sure that I'm the only one . I can't remember who I was watching this with before we started , but we all got sucked into the movie .|0
I love this movie ! It has everything ! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing , directing and co-starring this movie ! It is a fun movie to watch with your friends , I think it is the best movie ive watched in awhile . Its just a movie and dont really matter if its a comedy or a drama . You just enjoy it . And its really funny . The characters in this film are really great . And you just love them ! They are the nicest people and you just wish you were friends with them . the movie was funny and had a lot of great funny parts .|0
"""Yesterday"" as a movie, is hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film."|1
Heh ... I 'm surprised this movie still exists in any form , let alone it being available for rent. Click to expand... I haven't seen it, but there was a time I'd go to a theater with a friend (at least a couple years back) just because he wanted to see it. He's probably seen it more than I have because he is the kind of person that can watch 50 movies in less than a month. The movie was about a young girl who falls in with a gang of kids after she sees a girl get killed in a bar fight.|0
"This is one of the most laughably bad films I 've ever seen . I can not believe whoever wrote the script was paid by a movie studio . . . I really have a problem with any movie like this . . . especially one that is made by a "" studio . . . . I don't like it . . . it makes me wonder if people would even laugh at this film or if they'd think it was hilarious . . . there's no good reason to make something that is like this at all . . . . the whole movie is an unoriginal joke ."|0
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital ( TMC ) and was also working at Texas Children 's Hospital , Women 's Medical Center and Baylor University Medical Center before I moved to Texas . My experience at these places was a great experience and I enjoyed every single moment of it . Memorial Hermann is much more than a Hospital . It is also a place where we go to get better. I have learned more here than I could learn at any school. I have learned to work with people. I learned to have patience, I learned to listen.|0
I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV . In some sort of odd , surreal manner , I was not a fan . But I was intrigued . The idea of having a baseball game which was played without bats or gloves , or in the case of my era with no balls . It would be played without any rules . I thought it was great ! Not only would it be awesome to watch baseball in a non physical manner , but I also thought this would be a great way to get kids used to the concept of playing baseball .|0
I don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot.|1
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $ 5.50 , so I will probably buy it when it comes back online. It's just as good as they say it will be. I'm not going to bother listening to the audio commentary, unless there are any interesting features. It's basically just the same as on the DVD version, and they don't bother giving you a complete explanation of the production, except to say that this movie was filmed on location and that they worked with the crew during the shoot, etc.|0
I rented this one by accident . I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ``This looks like it would be fun'' . This one was different . I didn't expect it to blow my mind (at least not for a while). The story line in the trailer is pretty good, and the acting was great, but once I saw the first few minutes of the movie and the first few minutes of the movie, I was stunned. I really liked it. I would have given this one an A+ and would be proud to give my money to it.|0
"In yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called ""Women Who Kick Butt"", but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, during most of the movie Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie."|1
This Blake Edwards film is n't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy , a drama or a crime thriller. It is very easy to tell it is part of the latter category. It opens with a man in prison being questioned about a crime he didn’t commit. The victim, who was shot in the leg in the middle of a street, has already identified the man and says that the man who was supposed to have shot her actually ran away. The police are pretty sure that the man in the interview is the man who tried to rob him at gunpoint.|0
"Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? Is there even just a single genuinely FUNNY parody film anymore? All I see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself ""Sports Movie"". It's the same thing, though."|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians.|1
"They call this film ""euro trash horror"". Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's ""euro"". Trash? Ah yes, it's trash all right.You know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. Expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. Plus there's the sound -- at first I thought I was watching a dubbed film."|1
"I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old . I had half-day kindergarten so I spent a half day with my parents and then later with my little brother and my father took us out to dinner in the Village to a steak house where my mother would buy us drinks. The show was a huge hit, I don't remember what I listened to when I got home, but I remember the one song that was on all the time, ""Cathy"". I would listen to that song over and over again."|0
Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when Buster orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty, Fatty makes Buster come back to pay, Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in Buster's hat and takes money, Buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, Buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on.|1
"Absolutely the most thoughtful , spiritually deep , intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close . Jacobi is one of my favorite characters in literature (along with Shakespeare, and Dickens). He is one of a kind. His thoughts, emotions, and actions, are truly profound and deeply insightful. There are few characters, in any of the great literary works, who can say they are the heart of the story and the soul of it. Even if we know what happens, there are moments that can still make one think, ""Why did he say that?"""|0
"I walked into Blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: ""Panicky kidnapped girlfriend"" (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!)"|1
I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor.|1
A kooky , but funny bit of diversion . You kind of have to see it from the beginning to really grasp the story . If you like horror stories and comedy , you'll love it . In a world where the dead walk, only a few survive by hiding in the shadows of the human population . The rest of us have to do what we must , to survive . There's a lot of humor to be found here and you might laugh out loud , but not at the right place and right at the right time .|0

There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst . Saw is just that.The movie is very slow paced in the first half and the last half of the movie it just dragged. But what really makes this movie so bad is it's storyline, its characters and its dialogue. The movie is full of lies.The main problem i have with Saw is that there was so much of the story about the killer that the movie couldn't finish properly. In the end it just ends and it's like they forgot about what's going on.|0
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome ! Check it out and you 'll be amazed . The story of Jeskid is very very exciting . The story is about a young man by the name of Jeskid who has a dream of being a pro baseball player. He starts from his city where he is very very lucky in terms of facilities but is not a very smart person. He is a kid who always gets into trouble because of his laziness and lack of ambition. The story itself is very very funny and I would say it would be suitable to all kids .|0
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it , oh, yeah, we’re gonna watch the movie. We don’t have to read the book; we don’t have to go to the theater to buy it. We don’t even need a book to watch it, really. We can just open it and enjoy. It’s a movie! We can watch it anywhere. I’ve been asked a lot if there is a best book to watch movies, but I don’t think it’s that simple.|0
"I am utterly astonished at how over-rated ""Cemetery Man"" is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and I love just about every zombie-comedy I have ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult-classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his retarded, man-child, Curly Joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death."|1
There were only two redeeming features about this movie; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget about the plot or storyline from the book - they're completely absent from this movie. In fact, about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. If the film makers had made a good movie, even though unrelated to the book, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not.|1
"I attended a screening of this movie . It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups that are far too familiar . The screenplay is not bad but there are so many clichés that I feel like I had seen it before in movies that it did not add anything new . The acting is great . It was also quite entertaining , it was a good watch , I will not see any more movies like this one . What can you say? The most annoying thing about this movie is that it doesn't end in ""The End!"""|0
Hitchcock 's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of , but also the 'look ' of Anthony Mann , who also played the director, but who had a far less important , but more interesting role . Mann 's 'look ' was as much a stylistic and visual feature as the performance, but he was also one of the primary creators of it . He conceived the film as a noir detective story and had a major role writing the script which he then developed with Hitchcock . Mann did a number of different jobs on the film before finally becoming its director and was the only one to actually direct the picture .|0
Like some other people wrote , I 'm a die-hard mario fan , and I loved this game . This is not the game that made me love him , because the game didn't change anything for me . I had the original console in the 90's which was the same generation as Super Mario Brothers , I didn't really know how to play that game . So for me to play this game was like a dream , because this game brought back those great memories of playing those games . This is not an easy game . This is Mario 64, and it has a very high difficulty level.|0
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. The main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. That is the entire movie. I love to see very gory movies, especially since in America real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. So yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. But it just isn't really disturbing.|1
I 'm sorry , but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off . Totally implausible ( and yes, I've seen Apollo 13 , I know the movie ). In the late 50's or the 60's ( I believe ) a man was killed by a solar flare ( not sure if that was the right term for it ). The man had lived on a farm for many years . A small solar flare occurred which damaged some of the farms solar panels causing them to fail . The farm owners decided to fix the damaged panels .|0
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad. This movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture Christianity as most know it. I am also very surprised because this film is a BBC program and the BBC is quit well known for their quality programing, but it looks like the BBC's attempt to rival the Hollywood psycho/drama films are failing completely. Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion.|1
If you're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original, it's got some now. (Although I will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.)|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival , over three years ago . I went in with no expectations. I knew it was an independent film but I didn't know anything about its director . What I did learn about him after watching the film was something quite different. I was amazed by the way he dealt with the subject matter of the film and made it very accessible to an international audience. It made me rethink a lot of my own views about Hong Kong cinema and I think he has created a movie that can be seen by anyone.|0
The Priest , into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love , but the process of love. One day , as he was sitting with the disciples , a woman was praying in front of a temple . She was , to all appearance , very beautiful , and she looked very happy . When she was finished , she went back into the house , and when she was back outside , she told her husband , “ I have done what I wanted to do in the temple . This is where I want to do my work .|0
This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival . It is a wonderful and loving look into what was going on in this small town in the days of the great war, and it is now a place where the children are still playing and making their music. I am not quite sure who did it, but the picture is by Richard Jones, who also has done many other great pictures for this festival, and who died a few days later. I would like to pay tribute to his contribution by posting a link to it on this blog.|0
The idea behind Dead Silence is great : zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show . I am glad the film was made in the 90s because the plot was pretty original. The first time I read the script, I did not have the slightest clue as to what it is about. At the time, I was just a zombie movie enthusiast . Now, this is a perfect time for the zombie genre to be revisited in a horror film. I am happy that Dead Silence is one of the few horror films I have seen that does not rely on gore .|0
Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who 's idea this was and what soup this is. I mean, seriously, this is just too much to take in, this was like the movie you'd make to get out of working, not the movie you'd make with your friends. And the last thing I'll say about this movie is ... 'Hey, we're done with each other' and 'we don't need to do this any more', because that's what it felt like.|0
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait , but ended up getting tickets to Willie Nelson as well. We got up to Ft. Worth just as it was getting ready to rain. We walked around looking at shows and decided to get a table in the restaurant where Willie played. I had heard about him when I was in the hospital last summer, but had never seen him. I have to tell you, he is quite impressive. The first time I saw his show was at Dillard's where I went to see my sister.|0
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person . The sound tracks are not so great and not very catchy but the movie is very very touching . Well written . Well directed . And well acted . Its really worth seeing this movie . I have watched this movie once in my childhood and many many times again , I hope you like it too as I like this movie and would like to watch more such movies like this one . The movie starts with an ordinary family in a new house which they rent out.|0
Where do I begin? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real.|1
"Right up ( or down ) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool, and it looks like the movie will have great performances from some of Hollywood's better known names.The plot is based on the famous novel, ""Eve of Destruction.” The movie will follow the story of a young woman, Evelyn, who believes she can see aliens in the sky with her naked eyes. Evelyn has always believed in God; however, after a strange experience, she begins to suspect aliens are real and have been visiting Earth for a long time."|0
This movie does n't have any pretense at being great art , which is good . But it is a movie , about , what , what ? What are they trying to do ? They are trying to tell us that they think , they can make money off people . That's a no no . They want to use people as , you know , to , to make money . I'm glad I don't have to sit through this . I would not want to sit through this , period . I mean , the acting is terrible . It is nothing but , what ?|0
Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the very northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings.|1
Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the `` earlies '' ( often black and white and inventive ) the `` later films '' ( color , usually set in France or the USA ) the `` Italian films '' or `` American films,'' and last the `` Spanish films. The first three all belong to the same class, the Italian films were shot in Spain . They are of no interest to us since they had very little effect on the cinema of the world and were not considered as films of international significance until they were played in Paris, Madrid, Venice, Berlin, and New York.|0
Oh my god , WHY , did I waste my precious time on this film ? It is pathetic , it has nothing interesting to say , nothing at all and it has not even a redeeming quality about it , not even a small one , to justify this huge disappointment and a waste of time ! WTF is there to say ? If you don't know what you like and what is interesting to you than there is no need to waste your time on such films . I am sure you would not be wasting your time even if you are a fan of this or other films by the same maker .|0
Though I have watched Salò , I do not know if excrement tastes tart . If it does , this one is delicious . If it doesn´t , I´ll find another to try . In any case , this was a great way to waste time . And I´m going to find a good use of this one , after eating it . It´s so bad . . . . . . The best thing is it´s on the table and you can eat this with your hands , and not on a plate , which is very good .|0
Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.Every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless.|1
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice-over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and I didn't quite understand. The movie is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie specifies). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans, and enters into a battle with the bikers.|1
The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not ? I am watching a taped episode of one of my favourite TV series, ‘Blue Planet II’, in the background. As the images flash before my eyes I have to remind myself that I am not in a real world. No matter how much of a technophile you are I would be very, very lucky to have the facilities to view and enjoy the images from space. We have all known about the stunning images sent back to us by NASA, the ESA and the Hubble space telescope.|0
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1  Cheap looking villains. 2  Perfectly timed one-liners. 3  Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4  The hero hooking up with the hot chick.|1
"Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist , helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best and is least qualified for

Welsh’s “Ain’t No Fun ‘Til You Do”, the third single to be taken from his upcoming album, “You’re Never Gonna Find Another One”, is a song with an insatiable hunger. This time it isn’t for love. Nor for sex. Nor for the thrill of violent crime. This time it is, for Welsh, something more. It’s for fame, power and, yes, sex."|0
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law. It is the running gag about how you can’t find an audience for a good idea if you don’t find an audience for the joke and the idea. We all know it as that line, but it’s not an easy line to learn. There are many ways to get away with it, and a lot of them are in the form of a wink and a joke, or a laugh, or a look.|0
In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash ! ! ! ! I can not say it enough . I was not impressed . There is no way that I could have even attempted to review this movie in any manner . If you had asked me I would have said that the movie was horrible but I cannot say that now can I ? ! . If you were going to watch this movie I would have told you so . I would have told you what a crap this movie was , but I had to watch it and judge it from the video .|0
"I was surprised to like this movie since I'm from the ""check your brain at the door and have fun"" school of film viewing. However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like unsocialized Evie. And I've been in Evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with Evie were raw and painful to watch."|1
Eve is an eye opener , because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds , we have been lucky to have had this trip with us , we would like to thank the hotel staff , the drivers for making our stay so enjoyable and the guides and driver for taking us all round the island and making us feel at home. The people are friendly and very helpful and the food and drink was excellent. It was great value for money and the guides really know their stuff. The highlight of our trip was the wildlife.|0
"I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago , and have seen every other version since , but i felt the first time that something was missing

One of the great strengths of a classic is the way it uses all the strengths of a particular period in history. This version of Hamlet, from the '80s, had all of the strength that came out of that time period , and it had all of the tragedy and all of the drama that came with it. Of course it had all of that as well. This is the original play, and i've already mentioned that."|0
This movie, which I just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel, rather than on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of Coney Island.|1
A group of four young men , attending a prestigious private school , belong to an old covenant that was once considered “ the best in Britain”, until one of them went away to the US to seek higher education. They live a life they never expected when they went to school with other young men. In America they have been exposed to a culture and language they have never had the chance to experience. When they return they are confronted with the problems they were never warned about when they went to school.|0
This movie was trying to something , but failed miserably . All the attempts at suspense were cheap , and the story was not a good one to tell . The film was made in 2006 . It tells the story of a very poor young boy who tries to save the life of a beautiful girl . His life will be turned into a complete tragedy . The girl was in a coma for 5 months . But now she is going to survive . It was very touching . In the past year or so , there has been a surge in movies of this nature.|0
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure , the image of the cranes that fly back and forth. After a while you feel like they are saying that in the future you will feel that you will be happy and you will enjoy what you do because it will be interesting and fun. You feel like they are saying you are a real person. That you will have the opportunity to be the person you are always dreaming about. After a while you begin to forget what they are saying. You get caught by the movie itself.|0
Firstly , this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book , short story , novella , or anything like that. It's not even close to that. This is a very different story that will make a whole bunch of different fans out there happy. There are a lot of elements that are reminiscent of King's work , I admit that. It's about a boy and a girl who are best friends. They fight , they argue , they fight some more . They have their differences , but they still stay together. That's where the story starts.|0
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it.I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film. I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other movies. It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie, but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it.This films is Truly Exceptional!|1
"Why bother, ITV? Admittedly, Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to ""get,"" and Fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... If one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. And for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast Fanny as she was written: A prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! Mrs. Norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. And what the heck happened to Portsmouth?"|1
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness . not only was the film so bad it was utterly pointless it was so bad that the man who wrote the screenplay was so impressed with it that he decided to show it as the only way to prove himself an artist and a man . it was just so bad and so stupid that even though it had been a masterpiece of cinematography it could not be screened because of its complete lack of interest to an audience who had never heard of it ever before .|0
I wo n't waste your time by describing the plot for this , the other reviewer already did this quite well so I'll be brief. I think it's best to take the time to watch this movie and then read up on it. I believe this one is well worth viewing, especially since it has such a wide audience, and I'll be watching it this week with my son and grandson. This was one of those flicks I never expected to like. I don't mind a good horror movie and this one was pretty good, although not great.|0
This film was great!Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off.Tasha Smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear Grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.And Oh,I can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.Damn!|1
At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette , trying to free his no good brother from prison, he was trying to get himself a good wife and raise a son that would never be able to be taken away from him . His plan to get this son to give him a son, was to make sure Nathan knew he was the real father to his son . After Nathan was freed from prison his life changed. Now he could make all his money and he could do whatever he wanted because he was free.|0
"SPOILER WARNINGWe've all heard the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school."|1
"My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as ""fat girls."" I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level."|1
"I know it 's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to comment anyway because I know the film's reputation - and I'd like to give my own personal opinion. The film's reputation has been, in a word, shit. It's not that I dislike the movie. Far from it. It's that it has been so overrated that I was hoping for a few things:

That there was a great movie in this. I thought we would have had a few great scenes."|0
Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I 've ever seen . It 's a masterpiece where everything is at the service of a single goal , the story . Every moment is filled with energy , every line is packed with meaning . It's the most complete movie you 'd ever witness . You can say this film is the first ever Japanese movie to do the 3D conversion , because it 's not that expensive to do the conversion , and the first movie I ever saw the 3D conversion on . This is simply a masterpiece , one of a kind , that should be recognized as a classic by all of its fans .|0
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (A real acting stretch...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sells!) however when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) ""Battle of the tough guys"" who's champion Zeus (Played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital."|1
"I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the ""world premiere"" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say, I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I am unfamiliar with the book, purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, as I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by Jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me."|1
"This movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is ""going down"" in the America of the late 1960's. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes.If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days,.. just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids! Thank God, his career rebounded before his untimely death.The writers on this television turkey were clueless."|1
I caught this movie on local t.v . at about 4:30 a.m . I did n't have expectations for it . The movie was about a guy with a girlfriend . He has a dream . He has no money . He wants a new car . He finds the car for the amount of money he wants . He finds the money for the new car . He sells the old car for a good profit . The story was really funny and it made my night. It's a long time since I've read anything like this . It's just too bad it was so slow paced .|0
Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The story-crap The acting- crap(Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The plot-crap The subplot-garbage The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junkI have vowed to watch Romy and Michelle's High School reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes.|1
At first sight, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.Really, what you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him, he needs the money.This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago.|1
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not, admittedly, all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.Nonetheless, we haven't seen it filmed this well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.I was reading Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."|1
"For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, right then we learn (SPOILERS...if they can be called that) that the Devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! ""Prosatanos"" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for ""human greed"" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris!"|1
The Mod Squad isn't a movie, it's a void. That's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  I'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever, seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no-one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike. There is no plot, there is no characterisation, there are no set piece action scenes, there aren't even any scenes as such, just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second.|1
When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I figured that I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I found still very amusing was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part.|1
"I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie . If at one point you feel like saying ""this is stupid"", then don't waste your time. If at the other point you decide this movie is worth your time, then let us know how it is, and what you thought of it. The first thing I noticed right away was the lack of any actual story. It was all exposition driven. This is not the first time I've seen this style of film, but in this case, the exposition was actually bad."|0
This movie does n't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good . It is truly a shame, because if it were not for this guy , the movie would be nothing short of awful. If I have to write a bad review of something, then it's going to have to start with a bad movie . If you haven't seen this movie then you are probably looking for something good , something you enjoy watching , something you've seen before, or you just want some mindless entertainment for a few hours. This is your opportunity.|0
'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but was unable to finish it. I'll review this film version solely on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.|1
It 's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release, but it does happen. So far, that's exactly what Warner Brothers did when they handed The LEGO Movie over to The LEGO Group this weekend, who then decided to release the film in theaters instead. As a result, you'll be able to see LEGO Movie on a number of different fronts this coming weekend. First, you'll be able to go see it in 3D on the big screen!|0
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. Check out the minuscule crew credits on Camp Blood, there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in, its Brad and his buddies and thats it, no pretentious rubbish. Jennifer Ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts.|1
Like a lot of the comments above me , also I though this was the average scifi movie , but I guess it’s just different for me and different for the others, maybe I’m not the same as them, I mean I have not read the other comments on the same subject before but maybe because of the genre, I don’t know. Anyway it’s just my two cents on the movie. I was expecting the movie to be very good, I thought it was going to be one of the most brilliant movies that I’ve seen in a while.|0
For several reasons, this movie is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant. I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. And shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. But this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.There's worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing.|1
"Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. The only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). The dialogue...the plot...if this ""movie""(and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this."|1
Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love.|1
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club ( this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans ) I've always been curious about the evolution of human language. Since we are primates I thought we would be a good base for studying this. I have always thought it interesting that language is the result of language acquisition, and language in humans evolved long before the rest of animals. In my next movie I will be doing a documentary style study of this topic and I would love to get feedback and critique from you, if you would like to contribute I would be pleased.|0
This film reeks of production line planning . It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and tried to make the most of what they knew . But that's how most films are made . They don't try and be different , because they don't have a style . They don't have the time , money or the will , or maybe they don't even know where to begin . So they go with a formula to get the job done . And that makes it easier to make money . So you get formula films .|0
Stay FAR AWAY from this film . The fact that you 're reading reviews tells me you may have already seen this film, and that 's enough for me to not even bother to give your movie a second glance. I didn't see it, but I did read a review somewhere about it. Here's the thing though... I haven't even seen the movie yet, and this review just tells me to stay away. Why should I bother reading reviews of movies I've not seen yet? I don't think so...|0
When watching this movie , with it 's deterministic cause and effect , wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment , can you ever imagine , that a movie that is supposed to inspire you as a youngster , would come up with such an insipid plot ? A man and a woman go for a stroll through the woods and end up falling in love. This is the plot, right ? This movie should have been released in 1955 as it was about the year that I was born . I can still remember the film and I can't imagine why this film was so popular with audiences in 1955 .|0
This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie , but apparently that's not true. It's actually the cinematography, the photography, the lighting, and so forth. When it was released I thought that it was the best movie I'd seen during my time in the film industry but after seeing this I've changed my mind. When I watched this the first thing I thought was, I'm glad it doesn't have a dialogue heavy story that would slow it down for me. I like a movie that is moving at a natural pace.|0
"After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another James Toback-directed mess called ""When Will I Be Loved"", I've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.I like Robert Downey Jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.Heather Graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.Such a crappy script."|1
To paraphrase the previous reviewer 's comments , if you 're a Stooges fan , avoid this one at all costs, unless you want to see two of the finest performances of the '60s ever put on screen together in one show. (It is the only film version of this classic comedy that I can think to recommend). Stomping the Gas (1964) (USA, 60 minutes)Directed by George Marshall. With Dudley Moore and Richard Boone. The Stooges (1941) (USA, 105 minutes)Directed by George Cukor. With Gene Wilder.|0
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen.|1
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever ( and it 's usually not me), I ask them ""Why?"". They look at me like I have three heads or they don't even know what a horror movie is. Then I let them know that horror movies are subjective, so they don't have to go around and say ""It's the best."" I will say it, though; I think it was pretty good. The plot was fairly simple. It is a horror movie, and the horror movie genre is the worst genre."|0
If you put Seinfeld aside , this is The Best Comedy ever , no doubt ! Just Great ! ``I think this one is my best, because we don't do anything with it. But I like this one, I really like it. This episode, it's great for a reason, for what it did for me as a kid, for what it did for me as an adult. I got into Seinfeld. But this one, for this one, for this one, for this one...I really feel like that's where it's at.|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one . I wasted a bit of time, so I did a little research and found something that is really good for the soul. I really liked what it said on the web. I thought it was good so I decided to buy it. I liked that it was free and easy and that was really nice for me, but I think you will like it as well. We are all so busy, we forget that we really need a rest!|0
"To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. What a great movie!!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actress ""Simran"", what a beauty. Give her an award for best looking someone."|1
"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this ""movie"" left me stunned in my chair.It's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.This is the worst movie ever."|1
This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall . It is hard to compare such badness to that of other movies . The film was a mixture of the worst kind of violence and nudity with no sex in it . What I like about it was the plot line and the dialogues were so bad , that I have never liked a movie that has no dialogues . It has one good line , but it is a joke . The other bad parts were the acting of the actors . I guess the director must have thought he was in the right place .|0
This is an excellent, little known movie. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I'd love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players.|1
This was a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a man , who have grown up together and are friends . They meet up again many years later in their adulthood and become lovers . The story takes place over about 3 days , one of which the man has been missing for . The man is an American who is working in Paris . The young girl is an 18 year old American girl who has grown up in a small town in Michigan , where she has been friends with the man .|0
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan , I collect his movies and so far has get to 60 . The only thing I could say is i like him as a actor the way he plays with himself is the best in the business . He was in the top ten for best actors last year and for sure this year and will keep it up . And his films are great but he has not done a very good job in recent years with them . And the last few films he has turned out are good , like his last one The Untouchables .|0
"High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar after she was told by her coaches that she should not compete because of concerns over her blood

A teenager who excelled in high school athletics had her career taken away by her coaches when they learned that she was in danger of having a blood clot form in her brain that could have destroyed her, a court heard. In an explosive ruling, a judge described the high school coaches’ actions as ‘cruel and inhumane’ and awarded $250,000 to the 14-year-old who died in January 2015."|0
* * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * * My boyfriend , some friends , and I rented this movie in theaters . I loved it , it was a very well made movie . ................................. It was a great story . It also has great plot twists and turns . .............................. This movie was not for everyone . It had violence . It also had a few scenes that were very inappropriate . It was not meant to be rated PG . But it still has a PG rating because it still had violence and sexual content . ........................|0
the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), characters names change (Claire or Sara?). It is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. If it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG.|1
"This is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. It uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of Creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called ""horror"" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. There is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well.."|1
This is a fantastic film . The acting is some of the best I 've seen . Tatyana Samojlova is amazing as the little girl in the film . The acting skills and the direction makes this film worth watching . There is also some great action and a good balance between romance and comedy . I can not recommend this film to everyone . I am glad I took the chance to see it . I have recommended this film to all my friends that have a DVD player so that they can watch this great film and enjoy it as well .|0
"Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of ""Delusion"" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. When Jennifer Rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between Secor and Metzler is beyond ridiculous."|1
"Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored Scorpion Mobile. She battles the evil Breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved the bit about her having to say ""Yo"" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! It's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion ""attacks"" her partner steals the show."|1
"Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports ""it takes a village to raise a child"" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress."|1
`` Black Dragons '' is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time . It 's not as famous as ''Towering Inferno'' (1931) and ''The Battle of the Bulge'' (1944), though the former film is probably the more influential, because it is the first wartime film in color, the latter being an all-white film. Both were written by British playwright-screenwriter William Wyler. Wyler had been the chief scriptwriter for Paramount Pictures for a number of years prior to becoming a Hollywood screenwriter in 1934.|0
Bought for £1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. PV is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.A vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control.|1
Now for sure , this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and it is sure to make for an interesting conclusion to the movie that he just wrapped up. This is not the first time Willis has taken a little break from his work and put his personal life aside. It is just that now that he can do that, he is choosing to be more private with his work. It may not seem like it but when you are a public figure, especially someone like Bruce Willis, the public always gets to see more.|0
Steven Segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme's. Has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! I mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief.|1
Just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review? Yeah.I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to put into the script. I doubt it'll be published considering how poorly I worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. The sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.|1
'Don't Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. 'Don't' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd, disjointed, claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty, just plain grubby, for Brownrigg's world is this mad, unwashed, scummy prison cell of rants, obsessions and all shades of mental illness.|1
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film. For the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. It seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. Also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. Perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid.|1
"My yardstick for measuring a movie 's watch-ability is if I get squirmy . If I start shifting positions and moving around on my seat I know I'm enjoying the movie . I do this because if it wasn't for that I wouldn't enjoy it. Watching ""Titanic"" was a bit squirmy , the first 15 minutes or so I had to move around on my seat a good bit, then it all came back into focus. The problem with that though is I'd have to sit on a plane for hours and hours and hours."|0
So , you wan na be a rock star ? See this movie . You do n't like rock , just you are n't like rock , no ? You wan na be , a movie character ? I would be very happy if you come in my office , and I would tell you what your role is like in this movie . If you wan n't a character , then I can give you an acting role . What's the role of the main character in this movie ? No, there is no main character , no character , just a situation.|0
NBC should be ashamed . I would n't allow my children to see this . I definitely would tell my kids the truth that the guy is a rapist . I would not want my kids to grow up thinking this is acceptable behavior for anyone . I don't care if he is a politician , public figure , or even the president . We should all be ashamed . There is a difference between good and bad . If he raped women and killed them then what he did is not ok. I don't support his policies .|0
Last year , I fell in love with the Tim Burton 's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to see how they pulled that off on the live stage. I didn't even know what it was, and yet, I couldn't stop seeing the story of this weird guy who walks through the woods and kills people in a satanic manner. What a story! I watched the film a couple of times and I'm glad I did because when I saw it with my friends, we had a great time discussing what we thought about it.|0
`` Mararía '' really disappointed me . I ca n't consider it as a bad movie , but the development in the story just made the film boring , especially in the second half, i couldn't get any real interest . The acting is very good , but that's about all . I could see a great script . But it had too many holes to fill , and it is still very far from what I could have seen . I really had a hard time getting into this movie. The plot was interesting but there were so many problems with the acting.|0
It starts a little slow but give it a chance . In the spirit of the `` Wackiest Ship in the Sea '' this game will take a while . The story is decent . The soundtrack is decent . I had some trouble with the control system . My only complaints are that the voice acting was bad , and I did not understand some of the dialog . However, I can overlook these minor quibbles because of the excellent story line . Overall, if you are an FPS fan and are looking for an arcade game, pick up this one.|0
"so if a guy meets you and he says ' I want you to look at my erection ! ' and then he pulls a gun out of his pants and he says "" shoot me ! "" what kind of relationship do you guys have ? "" I mean , if you had a relationship with your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or ex-wife and you told your best friend or your best buddy "" I think I want you to look at my dick"" would you be upset if he did? If so, I think people need to put a little more thought and thought into it."|0
In short this movie was awful.I understand it's a Disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. HOWEVER, i must say this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store.|1
"You can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this ""freedom fighter"" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murdering scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men, Women, AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar."|1
There are movies that are so bad , they 're good . Then there 's movies like Rest Stop that you can watch in the dark, where you know you 're gonna find something good. There are some movies I have to sit down and rewatch, because they 're so bad they make you want to throw the TV out the window and just go for a good old walk in the woods. So I had a chance to catch up on some of those classic, bad movies of yore and it makes me wonder: How the hell did these things get made?|0
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything.|1
This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films , most of which I enjoyed. And it has a solid acting cast - some good ones, but nothing special. I found the ending to be disappointing - and the first half just wasn't that bad - it was fairly good. I've found a couple of horror films over the past few years - but this was as good as I have found any horror film - maybe even better - of its ilk - and I am disappointed. And the ending... well...|0
"Saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played ""Noel"", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good."|1
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett ( A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell ) Piper . It is the 2nd film in this series of films . You can get this film for $5.00 on the net . The story of this film can be summed up in two words : Dinosaurs ! This story is an old man's attempt to return to the way he was before he became a vampire . I like this story because it shows how one can change his old ways of life. I also liked this film because the acting in this film was exceptional .|0
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles.|1
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining ( which is n't my favorite of the three.) The movie is good. The story line is ok. The plot line is the same. There are no special effects. In the end, they all make the same decision. No matter how they spin it, it is the same decision. And so the movie ends. So I did not see it. I was in the hospital in a coma for over 2 days and I had to go back.|0
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie . i 've never grown tired of it. it's one of those films that has everything and more . you have the story of the protagonist , who is a very strong character with a dark side that has been well developed . the visuals are really good and very well done . and the music is perfect . but i have to say , this is one of those movies where you never know who the main characters are . all the actors in the movie are great , but not as good as the actors who play those characters .|0
While out divining for water , a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns ( Carolyn Kearney ) stumbles upon something far more bizarre and inexplicable. As Jessica tries to figure out where she has been, she ends up making an odd connection with the young boy who appears at her front door. What’s even more unbelievable is that the boy, Ben ( Justin Chatwin ) has the ability to talk to animals. It’s a gift that’s a little scary at first but Ben quickly begins to help Jessica in figuring out why she can’t remember anything that has happened over the past twenty-four hours.|0
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination , everything is so real that makes you feel and look at the characters. The story is very very good but what I liked the most was the ending and how you can easily find out where the film is heading. I like to watch films without knowing anything before I watch the film but it is so much fun to think what will happen to the characters. This is why I give it 9/10 only because if you think about it , I am not sure where this film could be going with the storyline.|0
I'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white, foreign tourist. They picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager.|1
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version.|1
I watched 5 % of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole thing in 3D, but I will wait and watch the film in 2D until then. It was an interesting experiment, though. In the film, we were told that one of the things that would change in our lives over the next couple of decades was going to be “The Future of Food.” I have to tell you here and now, that my life has been changed in the past few years by the food industry.|0
I ca n't disagree with a previous comment that `` Driving Lessons '' is more than a little twee , as I don't think you'll find anything to disagree with, because I agree with you, it is a bit twee . I have not, ever, seen it recommended anywhere on this site, or anywhere for that matter, but it is probably because you have never really been in a car, so you have never experienced the pain and pleasure that is the feeling of driving. That is why so many people recommend car lessons, because when they do, they learn that feeling.|0
"As was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former ""Wayne's World"" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films."|1
Movie Title - TartDate of review - 5/26/02Year of movie - 2001Stars - Dominique Swain , Brad Renfro , Bijou Phillips , Kristy McNicholGenres - Comedy/Drama/Romance/Horror/MusicalSynopsis - On a summer trip to Florida with his parents, a depressed young man (Bijou Phillips) finds love at the beach. Stars: Brad Renfro, Dominique Swain. Review - I can't say I liked this movie more than the others from 2003. It wasn't as good as the other ones I've seen, but it was certainly a good one. I enjoyed it, but I found it boring.|0
I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.Not only did Master P start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him.|1
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff.|1
I was expecting `` Born to Kill '' to be an exciting , high-tension film noir . Instead , it's like the most dull movie I saw in the cinema today , and it's not even an action film , it's just a dull , boring , middle-aged couple having an argument over money . I could not get into this film . The acting is not worth anything and the script makes no sense and is so predictable it was boring me to death . The film has nothing interesting to say and makes no sense .|0
Honestly , on the subject of the death penalty , I could take it or leave it . The problem for me is it is not a just or fair system . I believe in the system . I have been through that system myself . It was my father who did that . I don't believe my father should have to stand in a line and watch the same person do the very same thing to him , over and over again . It doesn't matter how many times it is repeated in the line , or in the execution room .|0
"With a name like ""10 Commandments"" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark-made film. Remember ""Noah""?? That was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had ""some"" truth to the original story. However, Menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated."|1
"This movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld either."|1
The original `` Psycho '' ( 1960 ) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock 's best work and certainly , as one of his more influential movies. The film follows a young British doctor who has just arrived to Paris to start work as a physician at a prestigious hospital. His first night in the prestigious hospital he is invited to attend a dinner , which turns into a seductive evening and soon leads him into a web of intrigue. The film takes a satirical tone by mocking the conventions of the British bourgeoisie as well as its class system.|0
"I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information : Score 6,7 , well ... I'll wait to be informed :-D

So, I've been thinking of buying the PS4 for a long time now. My main worry was whether I should get a PS3 just because I like PS3 games but I don't really like PS3 games (at least, I haven't played them and don't want to). Then I've been thinking of PS4 mainly because I really want it and it would give me an advantage over other consoles."|0
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote . I 've seen both, I 'm just not a huge City of God fan but I 'd love to see Chop Shop in the theatre . I also have a friend who saw Pixote but not City of God or Chop Shop . He didn 't care for any of the films . He had some sort of weird thing happen when watching it and had nightmares about all of the things that the characters in it did . Anyway I 'd be curious to hear how people like Chop Shop and the Pixote and City of God comparisons .|0
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it.|1
Everything about this movie was bad , the acting was bad and the plot was bad . And were is this movie made ? The only good thing i like in that movie was the first half which was pretty good , but the second half was so dull and bad , i don't even want to imagine how this movie will be made , i want to see how it will be made . And the ending is not worth it , i really like the movie and the actors but the story sucks , the only good thing i like about that movie is the last scene which was good .|0
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose, one may ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.It starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only till the heroine forces herself upon them. Not once but twice.|1
I went into this movie determined to like it . I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street , Glen Gary , The Bourne Identity . The problem is , it has a lot of problems. The script is so poorly written . The characters are either one dimensional and one dimensional characters , or two dimensional people , and so are the stories . They do not connect to the main characters . There are too many characters , and they do not mesh well with the movie . There were some good things in this movie , however , like the acting . The plot was just not interesting .|0
"Let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : ""Let's see who is meanest"" said with a straight face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny.How do you think Arnold will battle the evil of all evils?Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even Satan expected it they're so clever.After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate) it goes nowhere. Somebody get me those two hours of my life back."|1
This thing, directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. I hope Troma or someone would distribute this film in the States, so that you guys out there can excperience the French stench at it's worst.|1
I 'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been done. I will say though that you have to ask yourself why this movie was greenlit. I mean, how does this film pass the test of the MPAA? Does anyone really think they would allow the director to make the kind of film he is making? I mean, just look at some of the stuff he has already done in the past. For example: he made a series of awful, awful, awful films.|0
I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it.|1
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand . What I found was a badly scripted, badly acted, badly acted, badly staged piece of crap. That's not a complaint, just an observation. There were some good actors, and there was some skill on the set, but the script was bad, and the acting was atrocious, and the directing was atrocious. There was one good scene - the scene where the main character, who is in a coma and dreaming of what is going on, tries to communicate with his loved ones.|0
I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like I did).|1
I really liked the Far Cry game , nice graphics , good level-design , interesting and clever enemies , above-average combat system , and a few good points that i really liked but i think the game is a little bit too complex for people like me who like simple things to play. I am not the best gamer in terms of gaming and i did not know how to play this game , and i think it is quite a good game that i like and can play and enjoy the game , and i also enjoyed playing other games by the same developer.|0
"Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like ""Urban Cowboy"", ""Every Which Way But Loose"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same ""Urban Cowboy"" crowd. Instead ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title."|1
This movie surprised me . The box is misleading , the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film makes it look like something from an old black and white film . There's no doubt that it will be one of my favourite films , I just wish they would have told me about the plot and how it would turn out earlier so i could have done my research . I really like the idea behind it and would watch it again soon . This movie will keep me coming back . I think that the director was trying to find out what he could do when he was working on the movie .|0
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home? How does it even get to be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and I use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? I'm all for DIY film making but come on! That doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie.|1
A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off , at least I hope that 's what they were going for because at least the trailer looked fun. Anyway, I don't want to discuss this movie too much until I know more, because there's no way I will be disappointed. But I've read the summary so far, so here is my analysis. First off, what is a Quentin Tarantino movie anyway? Well, it is a film that has been produced by Quentin Tarantino. It is his attempt to make the kind of movie that Tarantino would want to make, even though he probably won't do it.|0
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley. Yet there is one moment, typical Wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the Indian wife of Gable. She has gone to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Nada. One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema.|1
"""Love Life"" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene."|1
This movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and hearing, and I didn't believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match.|1
I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot.|1
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies , and let me just tell you-it is not a good movie. It’s good, though, because we are forced to see what we are like. It is a movie about comingbacks, about perseverance, about the strength of your convictions and the strength of your spirit. And it is also very funny. It’s the only film I am happy to recommend, and I’m very happy I saw it. If you’re not a fan of sports movies, like me, you will have a hard time with this one.|0
"What can I say? After having read Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they appeared to ""big stalagtites"" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate."|1
"The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter, who in the same year teamed up to star on a television series on the now-defunct UPN and CBS. The duo had been on-again off-again for some time before Ritter's death, but it was finally their turn to work together for the first time. The problem was, it wasn't their idea to team up. ""I had just gotten the news that we were going to do it on a TV series and I thought, 'Let's do that,' "" Yasbeck said."|0
I 've watched the movie actually several times . And what i want to say about it is the only thing i want to add about the movie to this comment is that you have made a good one movie . It's a really good movie i'm watching now . You're not just a director who made a great movie but you have also created a plot and story that i liked very much about it . So i want to share a review with this movie . Thanks for all the effort you made to make this movie. 1. How do I rate this movie?|0
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ""The Origin of Species"", so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's ""Creation"" got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.I guess that the movie overplayed Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma."|1
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV , but I was dissapointed . The film is not worth the time it takes to watch , and it's a shame because the cast was excellent , but this is only because they were the main characters and they had the lead in this movie , so I can't even compare this film with the main ones because they were not as bad as they thought they were , and that's not because of the cast or the story .|0
What a silly movie . While it looks nice , it does n't make a lot of sense . On one hand, the movie is trying to make us feel a bit of pity or even some kind of anger for some characters . On the other hand, they are trying to make us sympathize with the characters in some cases . But, they are failing in the first part , mostly because of the actors . I saw it like a lot of other reviewers did . It looks nice but I didn't understand the story and it didn't seem to make any sense.|0
Do NOT avoid this movie . Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious . It possibly makes the worse movie of all time . I have no idea how this movie came out , but the story is pure tripe . However the actors are amazing . And the music of the movie is a perfect match . I know this film is based on an actual book , so I guess that makes it even better . But the story is not very good , so what is the point of making this film ? And it is a comedy with bad acting and music .|0
"The story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered ""valley girl"" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. What a great and worthy story line. But in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose?"|1
"I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films . I found the film at first boring but as time went by the film grew on me and I liked what they were doing. I really hope the film gets more exposure on the festival circuit because it seems like it could really take off in the independent film scene. I would really like to see more short film by this group. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with all of you! Friday, May 14, 2010

It's funny how this film was not as good as it would have been."|0
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of Christ or something, I mean Halloween isn't that important is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?|1
I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, not having read any of his book, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us.The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. What? They can't afford a room?|1
I can't believe I even tried to watch this filth. As an avid B-Horror movie fan, I was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, I could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of.|1
"""Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own"", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....Major league baseball....but not to worry, ""Mr Baseball"" is there to try and change all that. But just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. The storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on."|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle.|1
"Think Jumanji but with a death curse . A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that lets them kill other human beings. But that only brings out their darkest instincts, and things get a lot more intense than we could have ever imagined

Jumanji is a film that has had many iterations over the years, the most recent of which was released in 2009. It was the sequel to a short-lived television series which was based on a novel by John Gatins, also known as the book series The Gatins. This series was the brainchild of Michael J. Fox."|0
Hellraiser : Bloodline is only a so-so film . I believe it 's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I thought this movie was good and I 'm happy they made more Hellraisers but I have to admit it's only a so-so movie . I believe it' s the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series . I believe that this movie is the last in the series . They don 't get into sequels and this is the last movie in the series and it will end on a cliff- hanger . This is the first movie I 've watched this year .|0
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey.|1
This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. The plot is something that's been done over and over again! However, this one does it the worst! The acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. No one developed any concern for the main character. The movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie.|1
"Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if I were in charge I would have pulled out all stops to try and save this film . If you don’t know the plot , here is a synopsis that I wrote for you , and it will save you time . If you read this you may want to skip this section , as it explains the plot of the film . The synopsis :

A man is murdered in his home , but no one can explain why."|0
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth . Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn out plastic doll that actually seems to resemble the doll in the movie. Next you spot the man with the camera. He actually seems to be taking his time to get the right shot and then it's over and he has to move to the side to get in frame to shoot. This movie is so real it's hard to know if it's a real movie or not. All you know is you know you saw a movie.|0
When I first watched this film , I thought that it would be rally good , because it featured my favourite character ever . However , I was totally disappointed when they were trying to make it a comedy , because it lacked any laughs . The plot was so stupid , I didn't know how to relate to any characters and I found the ending very unsatisfactory . I had to wait to watch it until I saw the end of the movie , where I noticed that the film had a lot of good jokes and I actually laughed , but when I watched it in its entirety , I didn't see them .|0
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge . Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of mercenaries, sent to collect a legendary sword from a remote island. The only problem is they are not alone. This is no mere story about a sword . . . this is an allegory. . . . There is no great story about the sword of legend . . . . Only a great story about . . . the sword. And an even greater story. . . . . . The story of Argo is, at its heart, a tale of betrayal and revenge.|0
"I 'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere , given enough time maybe the survivors will find it as well . the fact is though , this was a film that made a lot of money , at a time when movies like "" a man called larry "" or "" the great gatsby "" were on the box office top ten . the film was made back in the year 2000 , which was the peak of the "" blockbuster "" phase . in that time period , there was a huge difference between a movie on the top ten box office list or even in the top twenty or thirty ."|0
Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- I particularly like the two doofuses playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very feckless and yet sinister. Some might gripe about the need for a strong Ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward hits the proper nuances. Amazing. Simply Amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times I've watched it.|1
I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves).|1
"This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars Robert Sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name ""Sam Marlowe"". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there."|1
This film is just as bad as `` The Birdman of Alcatraz '' . I do not refer to the director, Steven Spielberg , or to the screenplay, which is a travesty. `` Birdman '' was made by auteur Steven Soderbergh , the same guy that made '' The Limey '' (1999), `` The Devil's Own '' (2002), and `` Sex, Lies, and Videotape'' (2007). He also made `` In Bruges '' (2007) , an excellent movie set in Bruges. As a movie critic, though, I had a hard time watching this film.|0
"As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.It's on par with Sam Raimi's ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. You'll see the similarities at several points. Most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best."|1
This is a decent movie . Although little bit short in time for me , it packs a lot of entertainment . I will definitely watch this film . I really enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it. The story is simple, yet the dialogue is superb. I found this film to be a nice break from my other films, which I usually enjoy. The story is very simple, but not too predictable. I actually didn't know what would happen after watching this, until they told me that they were going to have another one.|0
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.He wrote this, I swear.With Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and makes it in to a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay.|1
"Forget what I said about Emeril . Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of my friends say I'm her biggest fan. Here's what I said in my last post on this matter:

I thought we might be friends. I actually liked her. A lot of her fans do as well. Well, she wrote back again, to say she was sorry, said she would not make any more excuses and offered to apologize for me if I'd come to New York for Thanksgiving with her family."|0
"Without doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of ""AAA"" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, ""G"" rated family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the ""GRAND CHAMPION"" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, JULIA."|1
I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue to be quite mature. It's a great role for a 16 year old. It's a great role for me. I've played a great deal of Shakespeare in the theater, and in a recent production of Twelfth Night I played Antigonus, the son of Lysander in the play. In my youth, I was also in several high school productions of Shakespeare. Well, this is not a Shakespeare, but I am still amazed how much talent there is out there.|0
"While I hold its predecessor, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High,"" as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, ""The Wild Life"" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, ""From the makers of FTARH, something even faster."" This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, ""The Wild Life"" is, nonetheless, a great flick."|1
I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title ! Sounded intriguing ! ! This movie suffered from the lack of editing that is very evident as well as from being a 3-hour movie with a very weak storyline and poor acting ! I was not that impressed with the cinematography or the performances of the main players ! Overall I was very disappointed , and I think it is one of the worse movies I've seen in quite a while. It had great music, great cinematography, good acting , good production value, but the story line was terrible !|0
Don't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.As I said, the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing.|1
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening, thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. On this promise, at least, the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual, adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. As does the movie. A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty, rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning.|1
"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the ""Fat Guys At the Movies."" The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen."|1
"This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory . The story takes place during the same time line as the original but the main character is different. The events and the story takes place after the main storyline ends. The series has a great atmosphere and is really enjoyable. The series features:

15 episodes

Animated stories with a lot of drama. The series is full of drama. The anime is full of character drama and the plot is full of events that lead the main story. It has an interesting plot that gives an idea to the story but the ending is a little disappointing."|0
"`` Mishima : A Life in Four Chapters '' is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative simplicity. Director Kitarō Suga has created a work of art that will be a pleasure to experience."" - The Times"" ""Mishima is a highly visual artist who uses images to represent ideas, but his art can also be profound, and deeply moving"" - Los Angeles Times

Mishima'' is a four-part documentary series that explores the life, work, legacy and impact of Yukio Mishima in a variety of contexts and forms, including new interviews and archival footage."|0
This film is great ! Being a fan of `` The Comic Strip Presents ... '' I just knew I would like this one. The story line is interesting and there's a lot of great jokes. It's just that there are no women in the cast and there's only one actor of color in the whole film. That is a big disappointment. The movie was a lot of fun and I thought it could have been made a lot more entertaining with more diverse casts. The characters were great ! They were all well played and the movie was a lot of laughter.|0
A good story about Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would be playing the same role of “Linda Blair” in two different Broadway plays. However, she finds she can’t play two roles at once in one play. So she decides to give it one more try and gets another lead role which is much more interesting and challenging. I enjoyed this very much! I like how she takes it to a new level in her acting skills. It’s funny how the roles can be switched around.|0
"this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a ""is this for real??"" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this! !"|1
"Although it isn't mentioned very often, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she's hiding something...This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about, and have sympathy for during the climax, which doesn't happen very often in horror films."|1
"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out ""Undisputed 2"". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched ""The Shepherd"", I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen."|1
Some of the secondary actors try , really hard . And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely . But the acting is just terrible . This film is made by the same directors who made the excellent film The Mission , and while it’s a better film , its a pity . This movie has some of the worst dialog i have seen in my life , and is just as bad , if not more , than that terrible film . I give the film 1/4 of the points , but that is because , i would have liked to have seen 1/4 of the points .|0
Wow ... just ... wow . There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to do my own take on it before I get to that point. This movie is very very good, I love the acting, I love the plot. I do not understand the critics and I hope they will continue to enjoy this movie. There is a lot in this movie that makes me want to love it and not hate it. I was expecting a bit more from the movie. It did not disappoint. You can see that this movie has a lot of life left in it.|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You'd think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising.|1
Animated shorts just do n't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film . This short feature is dripping with humour and is an absolute joy to watch. . The film itself is a delightful combination of music and animation. . It's a bit difficult to describe the humour because it is completely different each and every time you watch it, but there is a light-hearted and humorous approach which works perfectly with the animated style . The use of music and animation together is excellent and helps the film stand out a lot from other animated shorts . A definite recommendation for fans of animation .|0
"I can't quite explain why I find this so alluring and ""The Leopard"" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story."|1
Closet Land is an amazing , terrifying piece of cinema . It features only two actors in a single set-piece and a lot of the running time is used to show an almost endless sequence of images , with the two main actors walking, talking and eating in a variety of ways . The film makes no attempt to convey any kind of story or message but it is not a typical horror film . There is no gore , there are no jumps cut to another scene , there is not much violence and , most of all , there is no attempt at being scary .|0
MR . BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes . Written and filmed as a `` light , sports comedy '' about a `` baseball-loving team, '' and a`` baseball-hating catcher '' who `` is in love `` with the `` team. `` BASEBALL is a film of contradictions '' is the message of `` BASEBALL, '' written and directed by Jeff Goldblum and made in 1979. The movie is set in the year 1999 and revolves around the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox in the National League Championship Series of that year, which they won.|0
"I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera . I think it 's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian style of filmmaking . I liked also the fact that most of the story is told in flashback , and I love this kind of movies . Now I 'm planning to watch the other two and hopefully this time I 'll enjoy them as much

I think this is a really good book to read if you want to improve your Italian skills. I think it's important to read it if you have a lot of Italian friends that want to learn Italian."|0
"This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot. ""The French Line"", however, fails at all of these aspects.It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material."|1
James Stewart plays Johnny Mason, lawyer. Carole Lombard is Jane Mason, wife. Lucile Watson the mother-in-law Harriet Mason. Johnny sees Jane and quickly marries her. Mother is disappointed. Mother lives with them. Many troubles are ahead. Jane can't cook. Can't set the table. Can't do many things according to mother. The interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. Stewart and Lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. Stewart is Stewart. He is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film.|1
"As horror films go, ""Rest Stop"", could have been better in many levels. Director/writer John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. Several endings have been included in the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.The idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first."|1
"A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no ""I"" in ""team""!I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie."|1
"This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers ""San Pedro Beach Bums"".My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a ""walk"". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...)."|1
i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it. i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ? i finally did watch with that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the film. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film.|1
"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. My ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It's formulaic every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the ""dreams can come true"" schtick?"|1
"I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this ""film"". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing its ""praises"". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them."|1
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it got into the Panorama section, but still. This film featured:1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video.The one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby: homosexuality. That's right, about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off.|1
"Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch? And I got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is ""different"", someone nobody understands... She is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. Besides, Brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so... Fake."|1
I rented this film out of the local video store one day , you know , the kind of movie store that will take you in for $5.00 and then let you return it for $1.00. I took the 5.00 back and asked them to re-rent it at $1.00. They came back and took the 5.00. I took the 10.00 for a dollar and the 5.00, but I never did return this film. So, I rented the same film from a friend of mine, he had the same experience, but for me it was worth the extra money.|0
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia , as long as a movie is on TV (or radio or internet) and there are people who can get to it and watch it in public, people will just see it without thinking much of it. It is a theory I have been testing for years with movies that are already well-known in the States, and it is becoming increasingly credible. I have even seen a few movies on TV that people have never heard of, but still will see and watch on the TV.|0
This is absolute drivel , designed to shock and titillate the 60 's mindset . The acting is completely wooden , the dialogue is contrived ,the script is so contrived it has to be printed on a napkin . What is more , the actors don 't have any idea of how to play their roles , it's as if they were forced to play these roles in school , in a play in front of an audience that they can't stand . In fact , they seem to be playing their characters in a vacuum without a sense of humour .|0
"As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it 's not going to contain any historical accuracy, there's no reason you can't have a good time watching this. And, I'll be the first person to admit, the historical accuracy here is rather limited. But for the most part its pretty damn funny. There's a few historical inaccuracies but they're not egregious. First, you have to be able to tell when the film is trying to be ""comedy"". It's not."|0
"(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, ""Where Do I Go? "", ""Easy to be Hard"", and ""Black Boys/White Boys"". While I have not seen the stage musical, I think that it clouds the judgement of many. This is not the musical you see in theatres. Do not attempt to compare them."|1
"Hearkening back to those ""Good Old Days"" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole Season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. (We can't recall just whose it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former ""Little Tramp' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds of his being an ""undesirable Alien""."|1
This is a bad film , as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was cooked up on the spot , which is bad if you have a movie that is supposed to be about what it is all about . i felt the film was a bit boring at points , but overall i think the film is great , as it has a good cast . this movie has a lot to be said for its message , which has been stated many times before and yet i find it hard to believe in as i do not believe in many of it .|0
This was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. Character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script? ), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?|1
"It 's the 1980 's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that looks like a bomb site from the World War II era. There 's a little girl lying in bed who's just had her nightmare. And the girl's father is on edge. So he gets up and walks into the dark room and there's a ghost and he 's never been the same again. Now the ghost is talking to a reporter. ""I 've got a special message for your readers."|0
So , Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time , this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with characters who are not in the original story. In Curse of the Komodo, the two main story-arcs were set up a little early , so it was probably a good move to introduce those characters who are only relevant for a very, very short time , to keep the pace up, and to ensure that the new game has some variety. Anyway , we get to the new story, where we are now in the story of two different characters.|0
You know sometimes you just got ta have it ? That 's how this movie is with me . I can't explain why I love it . I have watched the movie about three time . It is really awesome . The storyline and action of this movie makes me feel happy . I never expected to love a movie . This movie is my first time to write a comment . It makes me really happy . Thank You for watching my post . I will write another review about this movie . I hope this review will make you love the movie even more .|0
"""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.It's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual ""good wife"" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player."|1
"Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever. This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons."|1
I grew up watching the `` Bowery Boys '' on the weekends and even at young an age I could pick out the actors by their looks and by the fact that they all smoked a lot of pot. They all used pot for a while but I was always the one who got in trouble for it, because in the movies they were doing it for a laugh, not just a way to let loose. So I had to hide it. But at that time it was more a social thing, it wasn't something I did, it was just something we had.|0
'The Shining' has wit, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Ausentes,' however, has none of these things; although it does borrow from its classic forebear; to wit, a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, 'Ausentes' is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically awful; it makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art.|1
"""Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable"", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries, it is stunningly photographed, directed with lurid enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist."|1
"This is a snuff movie . I 'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library . I am sure there are lots of out there . Anyhow , I will try and describe the movie in the simplest way I can . Let's call it "" The Big Sniffer "". I 'm not sure if I should use "" Big "" for the movie . Maybe I will change it later in the movie if there is anything special about the Big Sniffer that makes it a special movie or not . It starts off with an old man sitting at his desk and looking at the big screen ."|0
Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's mildly amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. Whenever this comes on, I try to encourage my child to watch something else.|1
The MTV sci-fi animated series `` Æon Flux '' is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character who has the ability to transform into any animal. She transforms into a feline cat. The series began airing in 1988 on MTV and ran for three seasons. The series became popular and was followed by a feature film in 1990. Theron won an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance as the feline in `` Æon Flux '' and became one of her generation's most in-demand actresses. Theron was born April 7, 1974 in London, England.|0
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the beginning I was attracted to this film, and it seemed to be a great idea to join it with a group of friends, to get the chance to know each other more. After a few tries at making some kind of movie i thought that i could make the movie a little bit better than my previous one. I decided that it would be cool if the film would start to have a narrative of it’s own, to take part in.|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli . This movie is great because it was directed by a comedian . I think the whole movie was directed by a comedian . The movie has a great story , funny jokes , and some great action sequences . A great comedy . I love the whole movie . I highly recommend this movie to anybody who likes comedy . I highly recommend this movie to anybody who likes comedy . A hilarious movie that is really well directed and acted . I love this movie . The story is awesome . The jokes are also great .|0
This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small-town football coach who's forced to rethink his views on gay marriage when his daughter is unexpectedly pregnant with his son's boyfriend's child. It is also one of the most politically incorrect films I have ever seen, as it deals with a number of controversial issues with the kind of open-mindedness that I think only a truly enlightened person can give. The problem with this film was that it took a very conventional, very safe story with a couple in love, and made it into something much more complex.|0
I viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course,was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett.|1
Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped.|1
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler ( A real acting stretch ... ) named Rip , who is forced to take the job as a wrestler when he loses his talent. ( I'll try to remember that one ) The film is based on real life events, and has been compared to the 1989 wrestling classic ""The Wrestler,"" but the similarities end there. In fact, ""Hulk Hogan"" and ""The Wrestler"" are quite dissimilar movies. The one that ""The Wrestler"" is based on a story, is actually a fictional story created by Hogan's wife, Linda."|0
I am not familiar with the producer 's other works , but this movie is a piece of crap . It is nothing but a collection of recycled story fragments . The acting is atrocious , there is no story line , the pacing is awful , and the editing sucks . It would be just like if director made this garbage film out of his own head . In my opinion there is no story and it is nothing but a bunch of story fragments that has no connection with the overall plot or theme . The only good thing i can think of about this is the music .|0
I can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much. Well, I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan. While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man!|1
OK, a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining. Could be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet... This film is the bizzaro negative version of that. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' Film producer. Shatner played crazy yet likable, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You'll actually see the boom come down in one scene.|1
"I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. Only ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" holds up this well, performance-wise. As someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. Otto Preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style."|1
I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid.|1
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view , and the soundtrack is lovely , we are left with a little disappointment . I was excited for the movie , not only because of the beautiful acting , but because it promised a new take on the Pride & Prejudice book. Unfortunately, I felt there was very little to justify this. I was hoping for more, but I am disappointed. Still, we’ll have to wait and see what the final product will be, but at least we had a beautiful movie to see in September!|0
"This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in . The movie had no real plot, and was so bad it is not even funny anymore. If I ever saw a movie with the word ""hilarity"" in it I think I would find it boring. What the film is supposed to be about is it's not what you think . It's not a comedy and it does not have any kind of plot to it. It is just an old woman telling stories about the life of a nun and the people she knows in order for them to pass their exams."|0
"A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon . The local priest ( who formerly dated Isobel 's sister ) is summoned by the girl's father to exorcise the demon. The father discovers he has been married to a witch and plans to separate from her. The demon is also possessed by a young woman who had a child by a witch who was killed. The priest has an affair with Isobel while the two demons try to murder the priest . Written by David D. Levine <david@ddell.org>

The demon was not happy about being summoned."|0
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them."|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point. If your expecting fast cars, T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this, you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think.|1
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank , a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo . He’s been on a quest for revenge since his father’s death and his wife is the only person he trusts with the information on his quest. It seems like his quest may be finally at its conclusion with a hit that would wipe them all out. What he doesn’t know is that two people are on a mission to take down the man he has come to trust with the information on his quest, and they will not be pleased if he has it all.|0
The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter , Patrick Sebastien . He likes music and humor . In the movie , two young boys from a big city in the middle of France live in the country . One day they go to the city to see a rock star , but they are afraid . They stay alone in a tiny room with no curtains or bed . The film is a little weird , but I love the fact that I am not in the movie. I can imagine the story without me , as it is not my story.|0
It 's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but `` Caligula '' surely must hold this claim. Yet while the film is generally well-received by critics, it is generally ignored by audiences. In many ways it has been misunderstood. It is not really about the decadence of Rome, and certainly it is not about decadence in all the arts. And it is not an attempt to explore the nature of man in the 20th century, but a film dealing with one man who, like nearly all the characters in Caligula , was in a sense the antithesis of the human condition - Caligula the Roman emperor.|0
Well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end. It has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. Nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.|1
If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. At all.4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6.|1
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.|1
the mario series is back , and in my opinion , better than ever . Galaxy is the most creative and enjoyable mario game of any series , and i think it would take a video game adaptation to match up to the sheer creativity that this series had in the 90s . i also think , with the current generation of graphics , that graphics will never reach the creativity of the snes era , but i do think that the game graphics could have been improved for this release . i also think that the graphics could have been made more beautiful and more colorful than they are .|0
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the CPUSA was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). The troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the KGB did, and presumably, what the good patriotic Americans were fighting. Yet the FBI did them and didn't bat an eye.|1
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was I wrong. This film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. I cannot comment on the ending because I just couldn't stand watching the whole film. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. So if you are having trouble with sleep then I recommend that you rent this film.|1
This is a stereotype plot . A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is beaten by an old fighter because the old one is better than him . Then a young girl enters the competition and wins it . She becomes so famous and so rich so that she no longer has to fight the same old fighter. But there is still a problem, she meets a young man who doesn't want to leave his old love because of the problems she causes to him . He is so angry at her that he wants to kill her.|0
A wasted effort. On the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event. However, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought that entering 'Enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies.|1
... why watch a TV drama ( billed as a comedy ) in which none of the characters are likable. I don't care for the main characters. I watch a TV show with my family, my kids. I have to say, I'm not very fond of the main characters. I don't like all the characters. But that's part of why it's good. I don't know, I'm not a big fan, so I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you I'm right. So, why I like it.|0
This film requires a lot of patience . Because it focuses on mood and character development , the plot is very slow . I can't help but to wait to see the final results of all the events they have gone through . I like the actors in the lead role . But the plot is a bit slow . It will take time for my heart to move to the pace the film demands of me . I don't want to spoil the movie for you but let me give you a little bit of idea what is going on .|0
Most of Chaplin 's most famous films are his full-length features . And , I assume most people have at least a basic understanding of what it's like to make a Chaplin flick . But if you've never been involved in the film-making process or if you don't know that Chaplin's films are, well, pretty short , it's going to be hard for you to understand just what they're really like . So in the below guide , I've included a little cheat sheet on how to get the most from a Chaplin film (or any other film , really ).|0
Arnold fans will holler in joy , fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment , and Catholics will just shrug their shoulders. He’s a great player, and his time on the big stage of NBA basketball is almost over. There are two reasons why it is a good idea to have him sit out next week’s game. One, he is the best player on his team. Two, if he had to sit it out, that would be the moment he would need to make the most improvement.|0
I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one season. At some point, it was clear that it would be a long time (decades?) before a new season came, and I didn't want to let go. However, that wasn't the only thing that kept me watching. The writing was phenomenal, there was a sense that the show was going somewhere (I didn't know what was up then), and it really had an emotional core.|0
Im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw away your life, don't see it!I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!I think this movie is a work of the devil.|1
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of German expressionism, which gives it a very cool feel. I wouldn’t recommend you to go for this one, unless you want to, as there are only two episodes, but there’s more than 100 hours of anime in the series, which is a very good idea. Anyway, if you are looking for a series that brings a unique look of the Persian art and history, then Persepolis would be the best choice for you.|0
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan 's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx , and what do you do with it? You open it and you read the blurb from which he gets a little bit of information. Then, and I know he said this already, but in this way you don’t even need to see the movie before reading it, because you already know what’s in it! You can already make an informed decision before you go see it. I think it’s really very smart and I think it shows how you can make the movie better by reading the book.|0
This is by far the most vapid , idiotic , insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, EVER. There is no plot and not one single thing in this show even has a purpose. No matter how much you try and find something interesting or relatable, it doesn't matter because you have never been a victim of the show. It is so boring it's amazing. I've only watched it once and I had to skip to the next episode, I didn't finish the whole thing.|0
"It 's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of newborn children."" ""Why are you being like that? Why can't you just say that I'm doing the right thing?"" she said. ""Because that's how it was when I was younger,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with how you feel. That was always the way it was."" ""I was never like this when I was young."" ""You had a choice."""|0
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set . Disc one is called Caught in the Act and it contains the film's original British broadcast in 1962. Disc 2 contains an alternate UK print of the film, which was made in 2004 for the UK Film Council as part of its 50th anniversary celebration. Disc three is the original cut of this film, which was filmed and edited under the supervision of Robert Wise and which was released in 1964 by the American Film Theatre as its first American release. This is a film that is best seen at a theatre with good projection.|0
Yes , thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie . The acting is below-average and the special effects are non-existant . I had this movie and i have watched the whole movie and all the special effects are non- existent and the story is above-average . I think you can do better movie than this movie . There are few good movies which you can watch but you will not have the feel that you have watching it . Overall I would rate it 3/10. I think this movie was great . I really liked this movie . The acting was okay .|0
"First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie ""Embryo"" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Okay, in all honestly, I didn't know all this, but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of ""Embryo"" could have done."|1
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to.|1
An under-appreciated, unseen gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It's not unlike Born on the Fourth of July, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-Vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc. ), this one deals with a much more personal topic: Family.|1
"A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (""scapegoat"") for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928."|1
I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show. And you have taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in.|1
Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there ` s no real hard core sex scene. It is mostly the same as before but in more detail so it is not as exciting. I do think the story has some great ideas that make it worthwhile. You can watch the film on Amazon Prime Instant Video. The film itself is great! I loved the film overall. I would say, watch the film for a better story, or for it being a sex film because I think the sex scenes were boring. I did like the story however.|0
"A moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan, and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" Really. A specialist in ""Oriental history"" who doesn't speak any Japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? Please. This looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary."|1
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. At first i thought that it was going to be good because I'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. Next time the guys who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.|1
"Well...it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. The plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting oriented, but in ""The Shepard"", JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape."|1
Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made . PERIOD ! ! Yes , it 's worse . There have been so many great comic book movies . Batman , X-men , Ironman 3 . This was just a horrible mess that did not bring much in the way of entertainment at all. The reason why the movie did not work was because of all the flaws in it . I loved the film . In fact I have never been disappointed in a movie as much as when I realized that there was no attempt to make this a great film .|0
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one.For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.2. You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie. (believe me, it's my domain)3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.4.|1
The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is BORING>BORING> BORING and BORING!!! This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film.|1
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show.|1
I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, after only just beginning. I looked forward to this show all week long. And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have won. It just began, and in my opinion,it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted, and sat waiting for it to come on; never knowing that it was canceled.|1
A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died.|1
"Okay , make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film , but I actually thought it had a lot of fun in the end . For me , that's the best I can hope for with a film that tries to be both smart and frivolous and then fails both at those things . As far as ""smart"", this was one of the smartest films of the year ( and it was in my top 10 for that very reason ). As a comedy , it is very clever , with a wonderful supporting cast and some terrific jokes ."|0
Mute Witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserved. This is one of the worst films that I can remember. I don't mean to offend those who enjoy good films, or want to see more of them, or have good taste. I am just a simple man with a simple outlook on life, who doesn't think a lot, and doesn't like a lot. I don't expect a lot from movies, and they don't really make me feel good.|0
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, Roundtree's small part is a far cry from his ""Shaft"" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in ""The Toolbox Murders"" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet)."|1
cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive.|1
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there . A sexy comedy , the main character is a young high school student that likes to drink and party in his small city . One day he finds a mysterious box in a dumpster . Inside the box is his younger brother who was missing for 6 months . The box opens and a mysterious woman comes out and tells him to open the box . Inside the box is a girl named Anna who looks like Anna from The Shining and she tells the guy that she is in fact his brother .|0
I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that I've owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of- it was so worthless that I couldn't see ever wanting to watch ANY of it again.However, I do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 pages of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars.|1
"""The Cave"" got released more or less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk."|1
"""The Moon Is Blue"" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" Whereas he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words ""virgin"" and ""mistress"" in his mild 1953 comedy ""The Moon Is Blue,"" Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" since Dick Powell made his law and order epic ""To the Ends of the Earth""(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics."|1
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. The direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.Spy Vs Spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.Even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.I got half way through and switched off - completely bored.|1
"Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August , a single mother who 's the working definition of a bad bitch.' Adele has no intention of raising Ann's kids on her own, though. And she does not want to work, either: She's just not ready. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Ann's mom is dead, so Adele can't be the breadwinner. So she has to get a job and become a ""housewife"" or ""homemaker"" (the word is not in the script, so maybe it refers to ""babe"") in order to support her son and daughter."|0
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him, that earthy, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go.But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just isn't.It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven, its point of view is muddled, the acting is all over the board, from naturalistic to over the top.|1
Sorry I couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ain't.|1
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example : When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the back of the van there should have been a scene of the two characters looking at the keyboard and having a laugh together. What was the point of having two characters look at the keyboard when all they did was type a letter and the next letter they had to type was not the next letter Dave wanted it to be? They should have been able to type the next letter. The writers did not explain Dave's point of view.|0
"If you 're coming to this film to learn something about depression , forget it : you wo n't learn any thing you don t know how to ask questions when you listen to what the film is about . There are some things i ve already mentioned in a few other posts here , and here and here and here and here , so i am going to put the link to that last one here :

I am sure you all remember the last time i posted here , it was about my depression and how i got myself into a very bad state ."|0
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game , but , after a successful career , he has decided to leave his mark on the game of crime , by taking over the reins of the most famous crime family in the country and making them into the most powerful crime family in America , the Cartel , and taking over their crime family , a crime family with over 300 members, in the middle of New Orleans . Harlan Banks , is a man who is respected by almost everyone he meets, and is very well respected .|0
In the 1940s , Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and the film industry’s desire for a fresh vision of America at its best. When the film that made Veronica Lake a national star was released, the public reacted in droves, and for the rest of her life, Veronica was inundated with offers from producers and directors who wanted to make movies from her story . But she wanted to remain independent, and was determined to make films that reflected her real-life story of growing up black in a white society.|0
"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen either the early 80's ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"" or the mid 90's ""The Stepford Husbands"", but this ""The Stepford Children"" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. It's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree."|1
I think Trash really sucks . I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I have n't seen that movie since . I think the reason for this movie's success is because the cast and crew made a movie worth seeing. It has some of the best visuals out there , but the plot is not worth watching . I really don't see the point in wasting your time on any movie if you don't like it . But for some people, they like trash , and you'll find some people who really like it .|0
"I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was a major reason why. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the ""straight"" role instead of the funny guy. ""Armed and Dangerous"" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter."|1
"I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say ""Comedy"" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows.I've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far."|1
I agree with msinabottle ; this is a great movie . Here are some dialogue snippets : Raisuli ( Sean Penn ) : Why me? Am I the first? : Yes, yes! And why the hell did you do it? : My father told me that this is my duty. : And you did this for what reason? : To save my father. : Oh, my God, my god. My father. My father. You saved him from this madness! : But you know the truth now. He's gone. : You know what the real test is?|0
Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots Piper, who dies.|1
"I have watched every version of this play that I can think of , including several on the stage , in order to prepare to review this. Here are some highlights of my review:

The play is about how women have been oppressed and how the patriarchy has been in control of society for most of its history. The play shows how this was not just an event that happened by chance. There are many characters in the play, all with their own stories of how they overcame the oppression, not all women."|0
Stanley Stupid ( Tom Arnold ) and his wife , Joan , like to sleep in bed with their heads on the pillows. Stanley has a way with words and is the first person to give me ideas. He knows what I want right away . . . right up until I have a stroke, then I get ideas that I don't like. One of the most memorable phrases that Stanley would come up with is, 'You are too young to die yet.' But he was right. . . when I was young.|0
Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There's the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. Unlike Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible.|1
so if a guy meets you and he says 'I want you to look at my erection!' don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes! that's the only thing what happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I ever saw! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch Lennon's Erection, be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too.|1
"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending."|1
"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his music from the start, but he has had an amazing year. There was a great story on a recent radio show about how one of his tunes, "" The Great Pretender "", was recorded in the same studio as the Beatles ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" . I never realised until then what a great album this was, with a superb Paul McCartney composition . His first solo album was ""Lonesome Cowboy"" , I didn't like that at all ."|0
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig.|1
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley in New Mexico with a nuclear reactor to keep them all company. It is the only film I can think of that actually includes the title in the title, with the exception of an earlier version of Planet Terror that was an early draft of a screenplay called Planet Terror. It is also the only film I can think of that had an actor play a role that, while a bit different from his real-life role, was still recognizable to an audience.|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. She should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave.|1
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his directing style is usually non-existent.|1
"After some quite OK Dutch action flicks , like Lek and Van God Los , Gerrard Verhage wants to make it into the international movie circuit and wants to make a big deal for his new movie Liefde. That’s why he has launched a fan campaign on Facebook. On his Facebook fan page he wrote: ""I made a fan page. This page will be my official fan page for Liefde. If anyone wants to get a copy of the film, please go here. The page will only be available for a few days. Thank you."""|0
"Jack Higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into ""one last job"" (where have I heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot."|1
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . Now I find myself on the defensive. I’ll try to clear some misconceptions. We’re all human beings and it’s natural to question and seek answers from those in authority. Even though many people do not seek out or follow the religious leaders and the leaders of science, many others are drawn to the naturalistic explanations and ideas presented by those who seek answers from the natural world and its laws.|0
Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times.|1
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs , watermellons , people , etc . They are also able to carry away eggs , birds , or anything else they see fit in their lives. They are quite smart and can even work out simple things like where things in the house are. They are also quite clever , as they will find a way round obstacles like doors , and they can get into things they are not supposed to be able to. They do not have much of a choice about their jobs , as they do not really have a life of their own .|0
New rule . Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original story and concept . I mean , what's the point . The movies of the last 20 years have been recycled so many times , the concept is now outdated and the story is so generic , why would I want to watch a film with a predictable plot filled with cliches and no twists and turns ? I know it sounds like I'm contradicting what I wrote . It's just not the case . Zombie is a film genre that has had an enormous amount of variations from the original .|0
This movie was so awful that I ca n't even describe it . I was amazed that I even sat and watched it because its not worth the time . When it ends , I want to run out to the theater and watch it again , or else I will sit down and write about the movie to see how bad it is . I loved it and I'm sad , but that's the way it goes with horror . It's not funny or fun or scary , but its just awful . And I don't want to hate it because it's not like anything I have seen or heard before .|0
First of all , I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen . I have seen it over a dozen times and it remains the funniest film I have ever seen , despite its flaws which are few and relatively insignificant compared to what is really great about it . It is hard to believe this was the first time this film had come onto my radar screen but it was . It is the best film in a very good year . This film was made in 1962 and is still one of the finest examples of screwball comedy ever made .|0
*SPOILERS INCLUDED*Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay a homage to Hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie.|1
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.Basic plot -- Nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before.|1
First off , I never got into Dr. Who until recently . Honestly , I never got the opportunity to watch it until I was about 10 years old , and I remember it as just a little cartoon. I never really got to enjoy it as I grew up because I had to share it with other people who would say that they would watch it but wouldn’t tell their friends because they were embarrassed to have to share it with their friends . Then when I came to college , it was on TV but not always.|0
"This show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the contestants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was ""Survivor"" or something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together."|1
"This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series , creepy beyond words . The tension and tension between Mulder and Scully build up to a climatic showdown, and one of my favorite moments was when Scully was trying to save Mulder . I had goose bumps throughout most of the episode. I don't know why, but this scene really made me nervous . __________________
I know the universe is out of control. It's like that old saying: ""You can fool some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool everyone all of the time."""|0
This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to . The trailer of this film is not something which can be taken for granted. This is one of the movies which did not want to be seen in theaters, and the only people who liked this film in theaters was the people who could not bear to miss it. So, if you are one of those who are not willing to watch these films in theaters, do not waste your money. But if you still do not have an option to see them, watch it and enjoy it, you will be very happy.|0
I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P . Lovecraft 's `` The Lurking Fear '' that was shot in three days on a $12,000 budget. The movie was shot at night to make it look like it was happening in the night. And of course I had to make some things up. It might have even been a documentary. Anyway, it's a good story. I have a few more ideas I'd like to try out, but this was a good way to learn what was possible on a limited budget. So here are a few shots I want to put into the script.|0
"""Son of the Mask"" is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" instead. I must say that it is partially my fault, as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first ""Mask"" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster."|1
As a parent of two girls(14 and 11) I have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake/Josh, Zac/Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work, paying utility,rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets,etc.|1
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise ; the sequels still surprise and amaze. The plot itself is not particularly complex, and has no real depth, so it's not surprising that the plot twist of the film doesn't seem to stick as much as the original did to me. However, it does not matter, as I was pleasantly surprised with the overall plot of the sequel. This sequel takes place a year after the previous one, and it is told in the present tense.|0
Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it 's hard to single one out as his greatest accomplishment. But when you consider all the things he did while still a young man in Hollywood, the list of his accomplishments is nearly overwhelming. When Sinatra died, he left his fortune to a foundation to be used for charitable causes. The idea is that if you love the people who work for you, and enjoy the things that make them happy, you should try to make things a little less difficult for them and help make their work more enjoyable.|0
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.|1
In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short , we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed `` Serpentine Dance '' that will become her signature dance move. The scene shows her performing on the stage in the New York City Public Library and, in the second shot, she is shown in the studio. The dance was filmed on November 1, 1961. (You know how long it took to film a scene in a dance studio, right? Well, that's why it's been done only twice in a movie so far and that's because they had to stop because it took so long to film.|0
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict . The movie is one of the most insightful and well put together documentaries I have seen. The cast is all excellent, from a man who was on heroin for 20 years to the woman who died of an accidental overdose, to the woman on the run for being with a junkie who was shot dead, and the young girl who became a junkie for a drug dealer who shot her in the heart. It is a must see for all of us addicts out here.|0
This movie was alright . Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters ( sorry for stating the obvious ) who against all odds are sent by their parents to live together in an apartment on the same floor of a building and work as a team to make their apartment as beautiful as possible. While making the apartment their way, they learn to respect their building and learn to respect others as they discover a lot about themselves. I liked the idea of this movie, but I felt there were a few things that could have been better such as the character of the manager and a lot of the dialogue.|0
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you.|1
Awesome Movie ! Great combination of talents ! I 'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding as the lead character in the movie 'X-FILES'. This is his first acting performance and it has me very excited. He has a very unique style that I think makes him unique. Also I love the chemistry between him and the other actors and it was very believable to me that they are a team, and he did such a great job in the role. He is very talented in every aspect of his acting and has a very natural way of doing so.|0
As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon.|1
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind . The trauma , the suspense is just beyond belief . This is the first time this has ever happened to me but I am pretty sure I saw this movie on video or something. The music was great ! I love the way the movie played . The cinematography is beautiful . I love the way it was all done with great style . I hope it is made into an actual movie . I was very surprised about how much I like this film and even more surprised at how much I love all of the music .|0
This is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography.|1
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! But do! I expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot!|1
"Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. Whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. The Radio DJ, ""we must stay on air"" spends effectively no time on air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the USA or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word ""zombie""?"|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays (I am not a fan of Shakespeare). But I did read and really enjoyed “The Winter's Tale” which was the story of Perdita as told in the play by a man named Terence. This was my second time reading the play and had a great time while doing so. When I went for my second viewing, I asked if the story was based on a true story of a real person. They stated it was. And that she was a real person.|0
One of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as a implied Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in McDonalds.Hitler isn't mentioned by name, since America wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!There seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's.|1
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies.|1
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself. As I said, it’s a cheap horror film that attempts to do more than it can. It fails at that too, in the end. I haven’t even finished this film, yet it’s already making me nostalgic for the good ole days when cheap, low-budget horror films used to exist. There was always room to grow, to be bigger and better, but this was the first time that was ever possible. The first time.|0
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into Moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this film, I was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (I'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from Biblical texts.|1
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary , then later felt I made a mistake , then that I would delete it . I have done that many times . This is one of them . I have not deleted my earlier post because I felt that this was a good opportunity for a conversation to take place on a subject close to both of our hearts . I know that many on this board are more than a little upset with me because I am a woman and am not always right .|0
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened & you will too. It's a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.|1
"OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this film. But it was so boring, that I nearly felt asleep. Sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yeah, for a B-Movie it is not that bad. After having seen her in ""Marquise"" some years ago (also a very crappy film), I thought that she would play more convincingly."|1
First things first, I am by no means a picky movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch to be entertained. I'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching.|1
I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.|1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck.|1
This movie sucks so bad . Its funny to see what a poor story this has , where two pea-brained people are put in a relationship , where the only thing in common is being fat . I couldnt even figure out how it was supposed to work . The characters were so boring , the story was pointless , and the plot was just terrible . It had nothing to offer . Its a movie of the month . The story is a little bit cliche, the actors are average, and the director and producer have not made one film before.|0
"I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there's not one ounce of ""cool"" in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than ""boy meets girl,"" the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes."|1
I was attracted to this film by its offbeat , low-key , 'real life ' story line . That is to say, if you don't want to be offended , then there is no point in watching it . This is a really poor film and not just because it is badly acted but also because of the blatant racism it perpetuates and then uses as an excuse to push through its agenda. I have no doubt that this film would make for excellent TV . It's not just that it's bad or boring , it's just plain wrong.|0
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here.|1
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film . The direction just isn’t there. The acting is all wrong. I’m not even kidding. I mean it is awful. I could not imagine any actor, director or composer trying to make a film out of a book with the level of craftsmanship in this movie. I saw this movie the same day I saw the book and have never read it. But I cannot get over the terrible acting in this movie. This is just bad acting.|0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film. In the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. Despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama.|1
What to say about this movie ? A married couple has more then just each other . After playing around a lot they decide to quit their job and try something else . That new thing they are after is to be in a serious relationship. They decide to quit their job and to move in with each other . Will they make it work , or will it turn out being a huge disappointment . And what about their daughter ? She wants to try to get out of their home and move away. Will she find her place ?|0
I enjoyed it . There you go , I said it again . I even bought this movie on DVD , to watch it in the theater . But I didn’t need it . It was just a silly romantic comedy , made in the 60’s . It was just a very silly , romantic comedy . And I did not like it . The movie was not even worth watching , I tell you . But I still have it , for my collection . Here it is , the first of a two part review of this movie .|0
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc.|1
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker(Scott Bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. During a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one.|1
Yes , it 's a SBIF ( So Bad It 's Funny ) classic . With a budget running into thousands , it's a challenge to make a film in this style , but it 's worth doing . It is a very entertaining , and fun film , especially when the story takes off . The story is based around a man who loses a leg in a car accident . His only companion is a parakeet , who he adopts and takes on the role of the movie star . There are a few issues to be dealt with before we get there .|0
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard.|1
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan 's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ramayana person ,I was expecting him to act in an aggressive manner. He is too passive to be considered a hero , and it is not that he is not an aggressive person he just did not have the opportunity to be a hero . He has the potential to act in an intense manner. His performance was not that much that it made the film worth it . There are too many actors who can do justice to this role.|0
OK , when I say `` wow , '' I mean , `` Jesus , please help me . '' I'm sitting at my computer with my family , watching a video of the last year of my life. My son is asking for a new game so I can spend more time with him, but I don't know what game he wanted . I don't know when this is all going to happen, I don't know if I'll wake up one morning and find I don't have to wake up .|0
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight. I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman. Wishful thinking, I know. Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.|1
"Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad!Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of ""Reefer Madness"" going insane for no reason.Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there."|1
"I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a 15 year old girl by her teacher. As a result, this movie will have a large percentage of the audience saying something like, ""How could anybody think that was ok?"" ""Why didn't they report it?"" ""Why doesn't anyone report this? This is a teacher at an all-girls private high school doing something so horrific, how could anyone think that this is ok?"" ""If I was the parent of this victim, I would be in prison for what happened."""|0
I was amazed at the quality of this film , particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - I'd never seen a director that could have pulled off these kind of effects in such a subtle, elegant way. I am looking forward to the rest of his work. Thank you for posting this film on your blog. Great work, as always. As a former student of Robert Altman, I can't help but think that this is as fine a piece of film as you could wish for. I also feel like I can't wait to watch this.|0
"There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something I found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, ""Smoooooookin!"" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe?"|1
It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time. The storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I don't even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor.|1
"I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised how good of a movie this was. I know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. It maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the morality play was a good one. I liked the realism which was along the lines of ""Unforgiven"". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it."|1
"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program."|1
"Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional Navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the U.S. Navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).Director David S. Ward (""Major League"") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well."|1
It 's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches and I was really excited. It was a little dark, and I was a little unsure about it, but I was quite pleased with it. The acting was good and we got the full story in one hour, but I thought it went for about an hour too long, so I hope they do something about that. It was a nice little movie, just a small film. There is a sequel, which is coming, but it is a really long film, about six hours long.|0
"To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, ""Nosferatu"". However, if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. The premise, such as it is, focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair)."|1
"I really love this movie . It has a very real feel to it . I believe it was never released in the UK and is not widely available in North America so it was a rare treat to have it in our local library . I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the books and film . I am very pleased with this purchase

It is a fantastic film that I just can't understand why it took so long to make. I always feel it was far better the book. This is a great film and you won't be disappointed ."|0
DO N'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the list of things I would love to have for my son's first birthday, but until I know more about it, I can't tell you what the heck it looks like. Here's the story: My son and I used to play hide and seek, and we went down to the basement. I would go in and he would follow me. One night I went down to find him, and all of a sudden he disappeared. He didn't even say goodbye!|0
I'm not really sure where to begin. From start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob.|1
Watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav...(realized then I should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot...India v Pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian super hero goes on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. I left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place.|1
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French way. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age, full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture).|1
I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom . I look here on IMDB , even though it is still in beta , I know there are already some good reviews about this movie, but it was a little long , and for some reason I got a little depressed , so I turned back to TV . I decided to try something different today , and watch some of my favorite episodes of the series. I really enjoyed these episodes, and it gave me a lot of ideas , that I might write . So this is how it ends up .|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.|1
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do.|1
Lucio Fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death, a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, Touch of Death starts promisingly enough, but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes.|1
at the story . It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her life and wants to see her family. She gets in a terrible car accident leaving her without limbs and head. She begins to live on her own and has to learn how to survive, as she finds out, she has many other issues to deal with too. And they are issues she has to figure out. There is a lot to deal with. There are many different issues. I hope that you are able to find this story as interesting as I am.|0
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have to be a 3-D production. The film was obviously shot in 3-D, because the images are so beautiful. I don't think there is a lot to explain about this film. This film is just a masterpiece. It is just so beautiful and surreal. This film contains a lot of symbolism, which I am not familiar with. Some of these images, for example, can be seen in the beginning, at the end and in places in between.|0
This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny , entertaining , sweet and memorable. The movie was written by John Lee Hancock in the early 1940's and stars the great William Powell and the beautiful Virginia Mayo as the mother and father. The story revolves around a man who is in trouble and is looking for a friend to help. In order to make a friend he must meet his father and mother and become best friends with the father , and have them help him out in a situation he doesn't have any idea how to help himself out with.|0
"David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable , or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks . The first Cronenberg picture he made was a short film called "" The Zone "" in 1987. This story about a man who falls through a wormhole and finds himself trapped in a deadly alien world is an homage to Philip K. Dick's "" Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? "" which Cronenberg would also re-create in his next movie , ""Total Recall ."" But Cronenberg's most famous work is probably "" Drowning "" in 1996 ."|0
I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going . But when I saw the smoke come from his ears and the flames come from his eyes, it changed everything for me. I knew right there and then that what I had witnessed was a miracle. The fire never left his face. In fact the flames would not come out until I pulled the monster away from him. By that time he would be completely covered in the flames. I held him like that for just a few moments, until my heart had stopped racing.|0
I would say this is a background movie. Play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). I thought this was a film that was done before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The screenplay/script is pretty awful. I love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. Ughh. It almost seems like it's a made for TV movie based on the cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? Even the secretary breaks out into song.|1
I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.The Muppet movie is about how they all got started.|1
OK, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I turn to to fill in the time. I have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, I knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolf in Paris or London than I would watch those movies.|1
We get to see who the good guys are. The union. And who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. This is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. The plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. It's boring and pointless.|1
Well , I think I 've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie ! I read the review in the paper where I saw it on May 17th and I 'm totally disgusted by it! But I can't really blame the writer! I just want to know, is it possible to like Woody Allen's movies or are they so stupid they're worth not even seeing? I'm not saying that the review was good, in fact it was terrible, but I did like the review. He said it was a comedy and that it would probably be rated PG.|0
Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career , spanning over 300 movies . For Corman fans, his influence and impact can be seen in so many films that it’s easy to forget just how many of them there were. One can look back at his oeuvre and see that Corman is the director responsible for such classics as “ The Pit ” (1975) , “ The Black Cat ” (1972) , and the infamous “ Army of One ” (1968) , or he’s a director you’ve likely never heard of (but probably should be).|0
"""Carlito's Angels"" is a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (I think ""fast-motion"" stopped being funny around 1914). The assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! The girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination."|1
`` Jefferson in Paris '' is a truly confounding film . It presents Thomas Jefferson ( Nick Nolte ) in Paris on a diplomatic mission. He's trying to convince King Louis XVI to join America and the French in a new war with Britain, who's trying to convince Louis to stop using slaves. And it's an interesting question, because while Jefferson and Louis have been friends for a while, there is no way for him to know for sure whether or not he should trust the king and what he might do in his own self interest.|0
"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann."|1
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all.According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being Percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the Pimpernel, but here he just looks bored asPercy and mean as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, andElizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat.|1
When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent.|1
"""The Apartment Complex"" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. This low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. ""The Apartment Complex"" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes."|1
As kids movie it is great. For the family it just sucks. I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all ages. This movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was however a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka.|1
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp , the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough girls' to defeat a rival. While the girls try out for the position of Cheer-Off Captain, the boys will try out for the positions of cheer-off Champs and then the team will face down the tough girls all the way down to the final competition. After a tough year for the Beaverview Cheerleaders, they are now faced with an even tougher challenge as they face down the tough girls in the Cheer-Off competition. If they win the competition, they will get to stay in the tournament for the next three weeks.|0
"In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD's on ""junk"". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.The movie didn't really do it for me. The ""Good Guys"" weren't any more good than the ""Bad Guys"". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I just didn't care which side won."|1
"Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a ""forbidden"" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding."|1
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD ( and it 's follow-up { Female Prisoner Scorpion}) for a few years now. I've watched almost all of it and it has been very good. There are many things I really don't enjoy about the movie (which are mostly minor) but I'll address each one now. For one, the main plot. I have seen this film a bunch of times and have always found it incredibly boring. I don't know why but I never really cared about the plot, it just didn't grab me the first time or the second.|0
"`` Witchery '' is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn ! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one (I can hear you groaning at the thought). ""I think it is really sad that someone would do such a horrible thing and not even try to apologize. That is not a good thing for an actor, not good for the character. It just shows you their true nature""

The fact that he apologized is the biggest problem. Not that he was sorry for the incident in the first place, but rather that he didn't care about the people he hurt by saying that."|0
I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films . However , I found NO WAY to download movies to my laptop without installing software. So my question is how can I download a movie from the internet without having software installed on my machine ? What software I would install ? I want to install something that is simple and can download and install movies easily . I am not asking for downloading software of any sort . I am not interested in torrents at all . I just want my laptop to be able to download anything that has been uploaded on YouTube, Netflix and other streaming sites .|0
"It seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. Some manage to do so with great talent. Hervé Hadmar doesn't. On the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very ""décalé"" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade."|1
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments : In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the attacks. I went to buy some food from a local restaurant. There was a table next to the counter, there were three men sitting and I asked one of them if he wanted to buy something. He politely replied 'No'. I tried again, this time with a firm 'Yes'. He politely replied 'NO'. I said 'Thank You very much. Please excuse me'. I left and I didn't see him again after that.|0
Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie ! ? ! ? Although I have n't seen any of his previous movies, I like the style of movies he has been doing for a long time. I am not one to like them but I do like him. I like his movies (I do not know any other directors)I am very glad I watched him work because it is a very good movie. And I would like to have his next one done right and better than the one before it. I think he should make more like that.|0
"A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple.Then there's Linda Blair. ""The Exorcist"". That's it.When you see ""Chained Heat"" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.Certainly not, ""Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come! ""Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize."|1
( Possible ? ? spoilers included , but nothing critical given away . ) I just watched this classic low budget indie feature with a bunch of young kids. A story about two siblings who play video games and spend the whole day in a room in their parents’ home. In fact, they play games until their parents go to bed and are unable to hear any noise from their rooms. Eventually, the kids decide they should play some more and start playing games all night. Then, they play some more.|0
I ca n't believe some of the comments here in the reviews . The film is dated of course ,but that is an issue with every film made today . The film is good enough ,but its not the film that the director was trying to create . There is nothing new about the plot . I am a fan of horror films and this one was ok . But I do think the ending is lame . Overall I would have to give the film a 2/5 . The cinematography is ok ,but I just could not get involved in the horror film I expected .|0
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud.One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Like classic Hollywood musicals , the plot is just an excuse . A must see for those interested in French cinema, and for those who remember how great the French cinema used to be . It is really a shame that some of the actors and directors of the time are so poorly remembered today , because they really were fantastic . I would recommend to anyone who was alive in the 80s to catch this movie , just as a classic film . I can not remember a single thing about this movie. The music is excellent though.|0
"The original ""Psycho"" (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates."|1
Let 's get one thing straight : I like much of Snipes ' work . Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries, he has never been afraid to show his vulnerability , and he never goes for the cheap thrills of a big action score . He's not a big star , not the kind of star that the big studios love . And he's not a star that I'd love to have as a hero , but I've never found a film I didn't enjoy seeing him star in . It was a real pleasure to find the film I did, in fact .|0
"`` Down Periscope '' has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS . Since then , we've seen new releases from the company and even a sequel to its famous film , but for a long time we thought that it was all in our head . Now we can officially announce the release of ''The Down Periscope Collection'' , the VHS release of Down's famous movie '' Down''. −

This collection contains the entire ''Down'' movie from beginning to end. You don't get to see the opening credits (because they are on the videotape itself!"|0
A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). Tracking the killer to his home, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick.|1
As I read the script on-line , I thought `` Capote '' needed a trim . Having just seen it on Broadway , I was thrilled by the idea of it having a trim . I think we need to look at the idea of the theatre in America. We are a small country - and our theatre is small. We have one theatre. We don't have three or four or six, but we are a one-off. And it would be nice if in America the theatre has its own trim - its own trim, as it were, and we don't have to do the trimbing by the stage .|0
Mark Walhberg in a great role , idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs , even if he hadnt heard the songs before , that's his style of music , a little more subtle than his other more 'rock' inspired songs , he has the ability to be able to sing , as in some songs you can hear all the instruments and all the layers , he even has a very cool way of making his voice sound like it is vibrating on the air , for some of us , it may not sound the most realistic , but to me , it just sounds so cool !|0
"OK, it was a ""risky"" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to ""Bloodsurf"", the worst ""horrormovie"" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it."|1
"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere)."|1
I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80 's . At first it sounded like a great idea to put the bomb in the middle of a city to blow up an area, but we had a problem with how we put the bomb in. We had no idea where it would go nor how far. After a few days of bombing a city it had to be relocated, and since the bomb blew up the ground it took a few days to rebuild the area. A few more bombs went out in the next few years, but nothing like that again.|0
"Awful, awful, awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy ""Biggest Loser"" is. Picture this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with IQs in the 3-digit area WANT TO WATCH? Everything drags on forever, with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care?"|1
"HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in ""The Big Green"". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Police Academy"", ""Cocoon""). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie."|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering to make the story more impactful. This may be one reason why some people who have heard about Memento have said that they don't understand why it is considered to be so influential, especially when many other games, including the original, focus on more traditional action. Memento is a great game in my opinion (I own it), but it doesn't really focus on traditional action. It focuses on telling a story and creating a mood.|0
I was really beginning to enjoy this show. It just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved. It is summertime so many people are not at home watching television. I know there are a few talent and singing competitions but I enjoy them as do many other. believe it or not when American idol is done for the year I miss it. Even though this was not American idol I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back on.|1
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in a different world than today's. He had a tough adolescence with his mother being in an institution because of her drug abuse, which was the basis of what led to her early death. He grew up and had a tough life, especially with having to deal with his father's drug abuse issues and alcoholism as well. He had a tough life. This movie gave me goosebumps. I was so impressed by the whole cast, especially the lead actors!|0
After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and they invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels.|1
Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out. First: The part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower!!! (I laughed so hard! )Second: The part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor. He seemed like a pro diving in, but as expected, he couldn't swim (proper at least^^).|1
"This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?"" It's that bad."|1
Now , I like the Bollywood films and I 'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. But one thing about the Bollywood films I don’t quite understand, is that when they are released in India (a big country with a lot of diversity) then it’s just not as good as the films that have just come out in the UK and the USA. Even though Bollywood has always had an ‘Indian flavour’ with their films, when the Bollywood movies are finally released here in the UK and the US, the films seem very dull and boring.|0
Sorry I could n't disagree more , with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on England and I've seen a lot worse on here before . I know that's hard for me to take and I really hope I never see it in real life though . I love it here and will probably stay for the next 100 years and beyond. The only reason I left was because I had to move to a very small place and I just got fed up being bullied by everyone . I had no other choice.|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection . They take a great concept and try and make it even worse . The film's premise is simple enough: an inter-galactic warlord decides to destroy the world using his own daughter as a human shield. Well it doesn't really take more than one viewing to realize this premise doesn't mesh with what is usually expected from a straight to video flick. The main problem with this premise is that the only person the movie seems to be focused on is the character's daughter.|0
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film ! But do not let that fool you. If you watch the trailer you will immediately notice a very strong storyline in this film, which will give you a lot of emotions. This film will make you cry, laugh, laugh, cry. In the end this trailer will give you the feeling that you are watching something very personal. I will give the trailer of this film so you understand what I am talking about. If you think this movie is not worth watching, just think again.|0
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does.|1
It pays to watch Reader 's Digest . Or Time , if it was the original source of the article before it was edited by someone at the Washington Times , and then published without a single correction at the very bottom of the page. You can also check out the Reader 's Digest at the library, and if the Times has an issue with it, you could check it out in person and get a copy for yourself as long as you're not too big to fit through the library doors. And if you see it in a book shop, you can usually buy it for two cents less.|0
"This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All of it, sucked. Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog, such as ""how ya doing?""..."|1
"A wasted effort . On the surface it 's a typical disaster movie : we 're involved in the lives of people caught up in a cataclysmic global catastrophe. But this is not really a ""movie"" at all . The story is really just a story about a family 's misadventures when the entire population of a major US city turns into one large zombie. There is a lot of this type of disaster movie on TV , but they are all based on real stories . And unlike most of the zombie stories on film or television , this is actually based on a novel."|0
It is difficult to compete against classic greatness , but once you make that choice and the decision is in your hands then anything is possible ! There are plenty of players I love but the one in my opinion that I will not forget and who has been a constant in my journey through life is Tiger. I know a lot of you will ask why I love him. Why don’t I just say that I love my dad , my partner and my family and I will always love him. Because you know what the reason is.|0
This was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a bud named Owen who he works with. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes hanging around with Bob. Now Owen hangs around with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accident prone. She is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. She too hangs around with Bob and Alicia, and Owen.|1
"When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(Richard Johnson of ""Zombi 2"" fame),a mad scientist(Joseph Cotten),his beautiful daughter(Barbara Bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.The tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.And though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."|1
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson . Ms. Merkerson has the capacity to make every scene come alive as if she is reading the lines to the person in the chair next to her. There is also an added bonus of her amazing eye for lighting which makes the picture look more real than a lot of photography. It's a shame she is no longer with us, as this is a wonderful portrait of a woman, but even so I am always amazed at how well she is captured in a photograph, whether it's still life or portrait.|0
"mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called ""wine except"" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin."|1
"""The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. The dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'The Phantom Killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Milton Raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit."|1
Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.Seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme.In Marked for Death, Seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation.|1
I 've never been a big Larry Clark fan , but somehow , I 've been dragged to almost every game he plays . And I find myself watching almost every game he 's ever been on . And I really have no opinion either way as to who is better or who is worse . It's just that there's this one thing about Larry Clark that I can't help but get into . He's one of the guys I've always been able to talk to and he'll give you the straight goods and leave you alone after about 5 minutes (or sometimes even longer ) so that you feel good .|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston , Texas . I really enjoyed this movie . I saw it on a movie night with a bunch of friends and we were all laughing our asses off at the same time . When I was a little older I saw it on DVD and had to watch it a second time . I just can't believe the movie was made in the 60's . I watched it with my dad and my sister . The only movie we saw at the theater was King Kong .|0
"How offensive! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those at NBC saying, ""OK. Let's make a movie to appease those pesky Christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order."" Well, they were wrong. Anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0."|1
Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of television. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. I really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot.|1
"I don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of ""Duck and cover"" or ""Protect and survive""!Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track 'Kinky Sex Makes The World Go Round', and you're pretty close to Whoops!"|1
"This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen, with ""Lessons for an Assassin"" on the #2 spot.The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible! ), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one."|1
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. I just watched this film on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming film, with wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney then the film would be considered a classic, however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone, the film has slipped through the cracks.The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and was released through Paramount Pictures.|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. Recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced Merchant Ivory-type features. I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain.'|1
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much ! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had. He has helped so many in soooo many ways. He has shown me a way to heal and become healthy. I've seen so much change in my life in just one visit. I love him so much. He doesn't just help you heal, but you can't help but to feel better when he is around. It's the difference between having a friend in the real world and being a patient in a treatment room.|0

hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night? Can't find what your looking for? I thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie.|1
Steven Segal 's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema . I have been tragically bored with every one I've ever watched, and it's been an ongoing challenge to find a good movie. But the one that stands out as the absolute best thing I've seen this year, that I will probably never tire of seeing, is The Grand Budapest Hotel, written by the director of The Life Aquatic, Jonathan Glazer and a writer who has gone on to write a good many other great works of film, Paul Thomas Anderson .|0
Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies . We picked `` Ik ook van film `` because we heard they did the best foreign films . And we found it to be a pretty good film . It was a family film with a pretty good cast . I saw it twice and enjoyed it , though I wish we had seen it in a cinema . It was well directed and acted and made me really curious to see the rest of their movies . I liked the story about the three sisters . Yesterday was one of those days where we went to the cinema.|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that , a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American laws and acts like he/she has a right to force the Native Americans to abandon their lands so he/she can build a mall , a resort , an arena , an airport , or anything else he/she wants . It's a sad situation that I have to face every day. We are not here to fight and argue with you or to fight you with our fists , because that would be useless . You are right when you say you are not a coward and you do not fear anyone .|0
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic.|1
"I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film . It is apparent that they have no understanding of what makes a great story. It would seem that they are looking at it from a film that can be rated G. I would like to see this film rated R but only if the rating was changed after viewing. I felt like the film was not well directed and that the plot was not well written. It seemed to take too many chances in trying to be ""new"". There were a few plot twists that seemed out of place."|0
"Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous , disfigured gypsy . The Prey is an adventure story in the vein of Robert Louis Stevenson's "" The Lost Road "" but is set in an entirely different landscape and set in the early 19th century. It is an eerie, suspenseful trip into the past that combines the best elements of horror, mystery , and suspense with elements of suspense, action, adventure, horror, and mystery. ""The Prey"" features a richly developed, fully-developed cast of characters , and the story is a masterpiece of atmosphere , suspense, and intrigue."|0
This was a pathetic movie . The Alien was decent , but the movie itself gave a new meaning to the phrase “I don't want to be a part of this crap “. It was a movie with too many characters , and too many bad ones . The main character is one of the bad ones , he's the only one who doesn't want to see how things will turn out , to be honest I wouldn't mind seeing him in the last reel , because the rest of the movie was very bad .|0
I tried to give this show a chance , but it really does n't sit well with me . Although this is a show I love I can't believe this is the best they can come up with . And I can't believe they have the audacity to think they have the best show in town . The only show I watched from the beginning to end last year was T.R.U and they had some really good episodes . This show has so much wrong with it . I don't understand what they think is so good about what they do . This show just has too much filler .|0
I've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast the plot hardly matters. An astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. His body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. But how did they get there? And where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in Maj. John Corcoran's body? IMDb lists the runtime for Night of the Blood Beast at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes?|1
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen. The visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent Black and White to Color switch. I also thought that The story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clichéd Action Movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do.|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults . Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the people that live it. People that have to be killed in order to keep them alive so they can live their selfish little lives. That is all I can write about, that is all that will ever be written about in a post like this. The people that live there will never get that kind of justice and never get to see that kind of pain and pain that would be the worst that can happen to them for that type of crime.|0
"A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this . but i have to say this is not a good film and should not be on a big screen , especially at a time like this when so much good is out there . you see , 
this is a movie about some college kids going to the woods for a drug deal . i have to be honest - i think i am a sucker for a movie like this . i am one of those people who always like a movie with lots of gore , horror , and suspense ."|0
"""The Quickie"" tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and...well, frankly, this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary.Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob-guy as being from ""Pacific Exterminators"" with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say ""West Coast Exterminators"". Eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh).In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets ""live""."|1
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made . Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, I also think he wrote the greatest crime film of all time, “The French Connection,” which was also directed by Paul. I am going to go back to my previous statement about Schrader, and I will say this again, I love him to death, he is a very smart, very intelligent man. And I will say he is a brilliant writer, and I don’t think he had a better script for a film in his filmography.|0
"Throughout watching ""End of Days"", I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see ""Se7en"") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us."|1
Piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. It starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest. For all I know it could be Florida. At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith, who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light.|1
I took my 14 year old to see this movie . We left after 15 or 20 minutes . It was too scary for my daughter . The last scene of the movie left my daughter crying and shaking and I couldn't do much to console her . I'm thinking of taking my daughter again . This movie has a very very sad story and some very frightening scenes . I had no idea of what would happen . I thought that it would be something different . I'll give the movie 4 stars because it was very good and I'll watch it again .|0
I rented this type of `` soft core '' before , but I can honestly say , I was n't expecting such a high quality , the quality of material is perfect . I do think this is a good buy , I will recommend to all of my friend . This is probably the best deal I've seen in the market in a long time . All you need is a bit of patience , you won't be let down , you will definitely be impressed . I received the jacket on time and it was well packaged , arrived very promptly and was delivered without any problem .|0
"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material."|1
I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated of course, and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now. But even allowing for this, Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost laughable. The scripting is awful, just awful, with no characterisation at all. The performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines.|1
"I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster. It is officially the only movie that I've wanted to undo watching. Let me start off by saying that I like ""B"" Movies. I consider ""Ice Pirates"" One of the best comedies EVER. I'll also note that I'm a writer and that I've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.Evaluating the acting: If I was going to pick a bright spot I'd have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this."|1
As a word of explanation , Disney 's `` The Kid '' has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin movie '' which was based on the real life adventures of Chaplin's son, Jack. A few years ago I was asked to contribute to the documentary series `` The Kid: A Family Story,'' which is a series of interviews with Chaplin's family. Chaplin's son was Jack. Jack was my brother. I was 11, Jack was 6 at the time of the interviews. I was interviewed at my school and was asked what Jack was like as a kid.|0
Ice the Limerick:A virus pulled out of the iceJust didn't know how to play nice.If infected you'll killBecause you are ill.The cure is to be infected twice.Ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other.|1
And one of 'em are bad movies . The title , as it turns out , refers to a killer of crows , who was a real thing, and had a name, and was, and has been , ever since the dawn of time . the first thing you're going to see here , then , is that the movie opens with a shot , as it were , of a guy sitting in the middle of an open field . he's wearing an old-fashioned red coat with long tails that hang down on both sides of his chair .|0
"I had seen this movie when I was a boy (Before WWII) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a ""A"" movie. No editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a ""B"" Had a laugh at how jaded I've become over the years. Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it."|1
"If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film ""Nemesis"", then you'll love this one. I loved it the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like ""Nemesis"" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them."|1
Anne ( Natalie Portman ) tells us about how much she hates her mother , Adele ( Susane Sarandon ) , and she has a very special message for us all: “You don't know how lucky you are to be a daughter! You don't know anything about suffering. You don't know what it's like to feel like a little baby. And you can't even compare your mother's pain with your own. And now I'm a grown-up! So I'm sorry to all my friends, because they always ask me about my mother.|0
It 's the Sooooouullltakaaaa ! Wow . What a skin peeling bad movie . Honestly , this is one of the most horrible movie ever . I think it 's the first time that the director of a movie . I think he should go back to school and learn how to write his scripts . He seems to have a talent for writing bad scripts . I hate it when I watch a movie and i think that the director or the script writer sucks . I think that they could have written a script with a little more creativity to make the movie more entertaining .|0
"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc. ), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of ""Passenger 57"") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker."|1
"I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed . It’s called ‘ “The Lodge”” . I have a lot of information that I can provide if you will help me . Thanks

I will be giving a talk on the film this afternoon, so I’ll post some information about it later. I did some digging around, and discovered that the movie is actually called “L.A. Confidential”. I am interested in knowing the real names and contact information of the film crew."|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido , Visconti 's `` Death in Venice '' is a triumph of filmmaking that was almost universally ignored for years after its release. That all changed with the advent of home videocassettes and VHS home video .

'' Death in Venice , '' which was released in Italy on October 28, 1987, earned critical acclaim as a major work of cinematic art that would not be forgotten or undervalued for a long time, even decades after its theatrical release . The film is set during the Carnival season at Venice , during the 15th century ."|0
I 've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him . I 'd like to see Rupert Grint grow into that role. What he 'd do as Rupert is very different from the type of Rupert he 's been portrayed as in his movies. The thing that I 've been waiting for him to do for so long is to break the character. To actually do something a little bit different. To actually do something completely original. But he 's been doing that now for so long that it 's almost like an old character.|0
"This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to ""escape"" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute."|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, that's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people. They couldn't be further apart in ideas.Novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may/may not use him for sex.|1
"Follow-up to 1965's ""My Name Is Barbra"", and shot in brilliant color, ""Color Me Barbra"" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (""One Kiss"", ""Yesterdays"")."|1
I concur with the other users comment. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. If anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad.|1
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work.|1
"I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I would feel morally remiss if I didn't disagree.Now, I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, ""He Knew He Was Right"" was absolutely horrendous. ""Carrie's War,"" however, is probably the best I've seen so far."|1
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad . This movie has terrible acting, terrible dialog , poor writing , terrible direction , and worst of all , poor story. The main character has no idea of the consequences of his actions. The movie is full of holes which could be exploited. I thought it was pretty bad , but I am not going to name any of the other movies in the franchise. This was a pretty bad film, but for me, not as bad as I thought it'd be.|0
"The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics. While the theme seems common, what ""makes"" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. Ditto for the music.The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. A very canny strategy by the writer/director."|1
"""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.The film concerns a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (Alan Curtis) run off and get married."|1
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie . I was intrigued and curious to learn about the world and the Underworld itself. I was not sure at first if the movie was going to be the same as the books. I got that it was an adaptation and not completely the same. I was very surprised when I did realize this. It was very different and I was very much surprised. The ending left me very confused also. The movie started with a very powerful scene. I loved it and I knew that the start of this movie was going to be awesome.|0
This morning , I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed . I found myself thinking , `` Oh boy , this movie really exists . `` The first thing that I thought , `` It must be a movie . `` I then remembered that this movie was made in the early '70s , and the first thing I thought was , `` It must be a movie . '' From there I had no idea what it was , but once again I found myself watching it with no real knowledge on the subject matter . I had no idea what the story was .|0
Okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . It 's difficult to take characters seriously . It really is , the plot is just a little bit off . I had a hard time believing in any of their actions . The characters are all so one dimensional , you really can 't relate to them at all , the plot is just too simple . I have to say though , i really liked the music , it really set the mood . I wish they would have spent a little more time on the character development that the music does , i 'm sure you can figure it out .|0
I 've seen worse films . This is bad but at least does n't try to be good so it can go down better than many others. That aside it has an interesting premise about what happens in the afterlife and is entertaining for sure. I have to say i was a bit bored the whole way through. It's not that I don't find this kind of stuff interesting, in fact, it's one of the few genre that I enjoy seeing. But in the end, I found myself wishing I didn't watch it and that I was enjoying it more.|0
I went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on VHS . I haven't seen it in quite a while , so I thought I'd see if I can put the movie back on tape . In the process of preparing this post I realized there was a couple of things about this movie which I hadn't discussed before , but they're pretty important to my overall thoughts about the movie and how I think the ending fits into all the earlier stuff I have written about this movie in the past .|0
I can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying).|1
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy.|1
The minutiae of what 's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all time. There is a real element of fear on display here, not only for the victim but for the criminals themselves. And it is not just the money, but the very act of doing it, the fear and anxiety and the uncertainty, that makes it so gripping. But it is also a gripping action sequence, and the way it keeps us hanging on to each detail to make sure that it all works, and doesn't fall apart, is phenomenal.|0
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance I cannot bare. Junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father Ben madly insane. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior which is why I cannot tolerate this movie.|1
This formulaic film ( hero 's girlfriend marries the villain ) just did n't move along fast enough given some of the other elements that were put into this film, but that's what happens when you have an original idea. It's not too shabby in that way. 1. This movie is pretty good. There's not a lot to recommend it in the way of acting and writing. 2. The story of the movie is pretty dull, there's no interesting plot, but the film itself has something of an interesting plot to it. 3.|0
The pace of this movie is quite slow . It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (from the Philippines) to meet her biological father while he is in China, and she returns to the Philippines in about 3 years to meet with her real father. It takes about two and half hours for them to finally meet in Manila. But the story is interesting and keeps you interested throughout. It is not a perfect film, but I recommend it to the viewers who are willing to invest in the story. The plot is good and keeps you interested throughout.|0
"I 'm not a big musical fan , but this is one of the few I really love . Unlike other shows I 've seen , all of the characters are likable and have depth . The script was a bit ""overlong"", but it really doesn't need much more . The music was incredible and there are some of the best performances out there . If you're a musical lover , or just want a good time , you need to get this show for your collection ! A must see for people like me and anyone that loves musical theatre."|0
I really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But, sadly, it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived.|1
"Yet another in the long line of ""Don't"" films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be."|1
Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie , and really squandered it . Do n't be led astray. The movie is well acted and it is the only time I can recall being truly frightened in a motion picture . I found myself praying for Williams and his wife . After the movie I looked up the film's producer, Norman Jewison, in the phone book and phoned him to see if he could spare me a ticket for a second viewing. I wanted to see the film with someone I had been talking with for over two hours prior to going to the theater that evening.|0
So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a huge marathon of all their new shows! I had been wanting to see and hear some of them for ages and was dying to find out what was coming up! Well they had a lot and they were really good so I will tell you what I saw and heard. I have seen them all but will just tell you a few highlights! First was The Expanse, which if you don't know was a show based on the New York Times best-selling book series.|0
It 's not fair . I was really expecting this to be a hilarious , entertaining movie . I mean that in the sense that what it 's trying to tell the story of a woman ' s struggle to cope with her grief of a child who was killed in a car crash . I really wanted to laugh the movie was so depressing . It 's so sad . I was really hoping this was going to be good . But I guess I wasn 't going to get anything funny . It 's like a story of a woman who can 't cope with the fact that her husband is dead which is so sad .|0
Pretty twisted Horror film , that has a few good moments here and there , with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes , and what I like to consider as a horror film that was made to look as if the director got a lot of money and then decided to make the most of it , because that is what a lot of people did when they were in Hollywood , with a few exceptions, like this one , you have people who just make crap with money , like the guy who did The Last House on the Left , or one of the great directors in this business, the late Paul Schrader .|0
Not a box office success ; no-one really knows why . It may have failed simply because of its title, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Afterall, it is one of the greatest films in the history of Indian cinema, so if it is a box office bomb, it must at least be one of the greats, don’t it? Well, here’s why we’d like to believe that, despite being an average movie. And here’s why we’d say no. There was a time when there was a clear distinction between good and great Indian movies.|0
"The only reason I checked this film out was to see the ""early"" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a ""gripping suspense"", and it was three-star rated. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what has to be the ""disaster"" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. At one point, EVERYBODY is a suspect, including a frail old woman."|1
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. You get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, I imagine that caves are dark.|1
"Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. When he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that ""other folks garbage"" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill."|1
`` No one really knows how the Power came to be . Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its history . . . In an earlier time, when he was a mortal man he had a name . . . The Book of Damnation tells of its history from its creation in the far north to its latest discovery in the desert. In this time, there are few records of its existence but it must have been great and glorious, a world unto itself, a place of power. It must have been a place of power then too, for there were no armies to conquer or wars to engage.|0
Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably.|1
"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the ""earlies"" (often black and white and inventive), the ""naughties"" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the ""nudies"" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and ""the rest"".This is part of the ""rest"". It is not really a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly no gorefest. The few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all."|1
Night hunter is a sold B style action movie . Get a life and grow up people . Don `` t have the guts and the courage to live your life on your own terms . It``s very nice of you to offer to watch my movie . I think I can make the movie look better for you . I like you too . And I think you``ll like my movie . It will make you laugh and laugh and laugh some more . And it will make you cry . You``re going to love me . . .|0
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie . I am in Korea ( please excuse bad English ) and we are going to watch this movie and it would have been a great movie if the movie was made by North Korea . It would have been a very good comedy film , a very funny and funny film . It would be a funny comedy film if the film was made in North Korea . If you are not in Korea , I am sure you could understand the humor of the movie . This is a film that I had not heard about before.|0
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. With that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. Well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next Wednesday's episode.|1
I find it amazing, that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). OK, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-Poles. Screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - awful. It's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. P.S.|1
A real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for TV movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. Stacey Keach is too soppy as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies TV spin off, of Planet Of The Apes.|1
Please ... if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie , if it can be called a movie . I was not expecting much and it did not disappoint . I can say that it is one of the better horror movies I have seen . This movie should not be judged on it's looks but on what the viewer takes away from it. This movie has it all , good horror , action , humor and a very scary ending . I liked the movie and I will definitely watch it again . The movie is an interesting one.|0
One of the best 'guy ' movies I 've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion . The film tells the story of a man (Tony Curtis) who believes he has killed his brother in a duel and decides to take revenge on the entire country . It has to be one of my all time favorites . The Wind and the Lion was directed by John Huston , who had made a reputation for himself by directing classic westerns . There's no doubt about it , the way the story of the Wind and the Lion is constructed is masterful .|0
this is film is probably one of the best i 've seen so far . i would put it only behind the first one . this is an incredibly well directed movie and the film is a bit too slow at first but gets better after about 15 minutes . ilya shaporov seems to be able to make any film great because he makes them interesting . every time i have watched this film i thought that this film was about to be good but i never expected this kind of film . i know that a film can be good or not but it's hard to see a film when it is not even that good .|0
Just how bad ? Well , compared to this movie , Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane . There 's the first half , which is a slow burn . There 's the middle half , which is a slow burn that goes on forever . And then there is the last half , which is a slow burn that goes on forever . In the end , we get a movie that's a slow , slow burn , and that 's it . So , what 's it like ? It's a slow burn and that 's it . Cannibal Holocaust doesn't go anywhere in particular .|0
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault.|1
Robert Aldrich 's brutal , quasi-black comedy `` The Grissom Gang '' , a reworking of the 1948 British film , comes to DVD this fall from MGM Home Video. In the new film, George Raft plays the owner of a New York radio station, who has trouble keeping his show from going over the top. When one of his regulars gets murdered, it leads to an investigation of his radio show's most popular host, who in turn becomes a suspect in the murder investigation. It was one of the most controversial and best-selling films of the late 1950s when it first came to theaters.|0
I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster . It was a box that had a lot of promise, but it just didn't measure up to the hype I was expecting to see. In my opinion, it didn't measure up to my expectations. However, I do have a few complaints of its own about the film's quality, but I'll get to those in another post. The film itself is very well made, and its story is quite good.|0
This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. This isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. It's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing.|1
THE QUICKIE ( 1 outta 5 stars ) Pretty poor movie ... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who goes on a killing spree and leaves a wife, daughter, sister and cousin to their fate. As I sat in the dark, I kept thinking I could hear her cry out for help. It didn't help when I had to sit there and watch a movie that didn't end up as a thriller/thriller or even much of an interesting story. No wonder this movie is rated PG-13. If you like a violent, action movie that isn't a total crapfest, this is one to check out.|0
I 've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was , perhaps , the hardest working lead actress of the 30 's and . I don ' t know, it ' s the only time I ever felt like a real actress. So I ' m hoping that one of these new movies will show her to be that way. That she ' s got the guts to go after the best jobs and to do it. She ' s not afraid to have fun. I don't remember seeing any of this on TV. She didn ' t get to do those things on other television shows.|0
"This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being ""weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students"". Sorry TV writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality."|1
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.|1
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12."|1
When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought `` god , this is horrible ! '' But I saw her a few more times that year and found her really funny and entertaining . I really wanted to like her and she made me laugh out loud . I was sad when she was forced to end her series but I still enjoyed her performances . She is now my all time fav female comedian , and the first female comic that has made me giggle out loud with every sketch or act that she has put on .|0
"The sort of ""little"" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. Sort of a ""soul"" version of the more well-known ""The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells"". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas."|1
"Like Margot in `` Fear of Fear '' falls victim of her ambitious husband , like Fox in `` Fox & His Friends ' '' she is left with too much time on her hands to find herself. ### Chapter 13

An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! All in all, it's pretty silly stuff. I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects.|1
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I've only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste.|1
The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ) .The director made this too sappy a production . Maybe it 's the generation gap between this film 's stars and its audience . But the film seems like one long joke on the audience . No matter that the plot is very predictable and has only one surprise in it ( in the end , anyway , there was one). It would have been better served if it was more lighthearted ( but then it was also a very sappy film , too sappy, in fact , and that's not good, either) .|0
Are you kidding me ? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the vocals. They were so loud that they were the only thing that was going through my headphones. Now, I am not a fan of anything that I can clearly hear but I was shocked! I would have never known that something as important as the vocals was going to sound so loud! Anyway, my point is I have been to this concert and it was a great experience. I am so happy to have been able to experience this concert.|0
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie . But then you wouldn't get the same experience as the people in the actual movie. That's why I said the characters in the movie should have been set in the island. If they were on the island and had no way to get out, what's the point? I just don't know, I don't like the movie. It makes me think that it's just a big joke, and it doesn't live up to it's name.|0
I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it ! i scored it a 1 in one class and another a 2 and a 3 in two others. i don't know how i scored so well. i also wish the instructor had been able to hear my problem instead of giving me a F on the test. i got a B+ for that instructor. and i got that test back in about three hours. i think that this course is a waste of money. it will only help in passing the course.|0
`` Rififi '' is a terrific heist movie , and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. The story follows a group of thieves , led by the titular ' Rififi ' , in their quest to steal an armored car from a rival gang. The film has been released in various formats since its initial release, and the one used here is a region 2 DVD. While the film was made as a budget and time constraint, it's still a great piece of filmmaking . It's also available on Netflix , so there's no shame in giving this one a shot.|0
I would say this is a background movie . Play it the background as your tending to busy work (or something that is not related to your work) like watching cartoons, surfing or playing with your kids. This background movie will not take more than few minutes so no need to waste your time to find it. This is a nice background movie I have created for you. I have included a short and long version of background movie for easy download. You can also download this background movie in full length (2:40 minutes).|0
Beautiful .... that one word pretty much sums up this whole film . Everything from the cinematography , the directing, the acting, the music and the costumes is so perfectly placed that it is almost unbearable . The way the film builds up to the actual ending is absolutely amazing , and i was a bit shocked to hear how it was shot in only one take . What a beautiful movie . There is another film in the same vein, with a similar cast but with completely different story-lines. It is called THE WICKED + THE WIZARD, and was made back in 2010.|0
This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary 's lives into something unrecognizable . To make Mary Boleyn , Anne had to kill her father . I can't remember what the real story was but it must have involved her mother dying and Mary having to take over the family. She was not at fault. I know it was part of the Tudor story but how could anyone have been happy about it? The movie has a good ending but it doesn't make it any easier to see. There are no characters in the movie with whom you'd want to spend time.|0
First of all , I have watched this show since I was a little toddler , and I have always loved Star Wars , even as a toddler . I loved the movie series, and of course, I love the Star Wars films. But , I also have always thought that Luke Skywalker was far too arrogant and foolish , and that Han Solo was far too greedy and ruthless . So , I really love the Star Wars films , and I am not going to talk about them . I am going to talk about an upcoming film .|0
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film.|1
I think I can safely say ( without really giving anything away ) , that this movie had no robots, and a whole lot of humans. A lot of humans. If you haven't read my reviews on this movie yet, I think I'd advise you to at least watch my movie review and see if it fits with this movie, because if it does, I think it is safe to say that you are not missing out. So if you have read this review before, feel free to bookmark it and return whenever you are interested.|0
'The Dresser ' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. And you can't. In the best way, of course. If there is a fault with them, it is a fault, and in fact a fatal flaw, in the writing. It's just that there's nothing else in any other way. That is why they're so perfect – it's just that they are perfect and nothing else. No other films in the same category can say the same.|0
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' London.The movie is held completely in 'dark' colours, which I personally don't like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.|1
OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well.First off, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Other than those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror.|1
Okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. Mr. Cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess?|1
I know it 's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD , particularly from the 80 's , 90 , and 00 . . . , but we have some very nice ones . . . I would recommend a visit to your local library (or maybe a bookstore), and if the library has a section of film titles, go for it! I have been watching films in Europe for over 30 years, so I am very familiar with them, and I really like the ones I see on DVD. . .|0
Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious.|1
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I thought it’d be a good time to look at them. I love Laurel and Hardy and their characters in their own ways , but there’s something I haven’t mentioned. Their careers have been closely linked with Hollywood and the movies and television shows they starred in. And, not coincidentally, one of the best stories about Laurel & Hardy is, in fact, part of the show “The Adventures of Oompa-Loompa”.|0
Well well , at last a view of this underrated flick . But you ca n't find a good copy in any film archive . As soon as I saw this scene in this movie , I was thinking about the scene in this movie . So, what is the scene ? Why should I like it ? What are the characters ? Why do they appear in it ? What's the plot line ? I must admit this is one of those movies which I'm not interested about . I'm just curious as to why i like this movie so much .|0
"Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre-""Malcolm in the Middle"" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. It has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed."|1
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to pick this DVD up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, I'll spend £10 and buy it. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing to say about it.|1
"I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like ""Boston Legal"" or ""Ally McBeal"" or even ""LA Law."" This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt, like the ""Chewbacca defense"" on South Park.) This is a real travesty of justice, the legal system gone horribly wrong, and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype, who use all of their skills to right it."|1
"This is absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset. The acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. The end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care. The one exception to this is the lead character ""Joe"" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!)"|1
"The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate ( i.e . ground , air , and sea ). The story of the 2nd Battalion was how they would come back from the jungle, become Marines again, and start a new chapter of life. Season 1 of the 2nd Marine Regiment

The 2nd Battalion was the smallest battalion in the 2nd Marine Regiment. Its mission was to hold the area that was known as the 2nd Marine District, in which is located the base where all Marine forces were based. This would be known as Camp Lejeune."|0
the actors can not act . all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character . Channing Tatum is very funny but in this movie , he did not show his talent . the story is very poor , the plot was boring . it was very disappointing and it is a waste of 2 hours of my time . 3/5 stars. I saw this movie and I loved it and was glad that I got to see it. It is definitely not a good movie but it was well done and worth the time that I spent with it.|0
"`` The Cave '' got released more or less simultaneously with the English film `` The Descent '' , directed by the late Steven Spielberg. Both films were made in 1983, and each was nominated for a Razzies, the first for `` The Descent '', and the second for `` The Cave. +

''''[[TheCaveFilm]]''': ''[[TheDescent]]'' was released a year earlier and got nominated for a Razzies. The ''[[TheCaveSeries]]'' was an attempt to produce a number of films based upon Stephen King''s novels in a different genre."|0
"This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The script was awful. What was even worse were the camera shots and sound. Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had ""recreated"" the top of the building."|1
I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I did n't stop to consider whether it was worth the hype. That's my own fault for being so easily influenced. I saw the movie when it was released, and was impressed by it - but after seeing it again, I was amazed at what was done with it. It was interesting, and it's a well made and interesting film - and I thoroughly enjoyed it - but, as a movie - it was nothing special. And I admit - I am not the first one to notice this.|0
This is a very strange film , with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. The film was shot in Los Angeles in the 1970s and has been sitting on my shelf for years without me ever getting around to watching it. I finally got around to viewing the film recently. This review is not going to be spoiler free, so if you want to know what's what then this is not the place for you to look. This review will include only what is new or important. It won't be a spoiler film, but a film about a very strange thing.|0
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever . It really does not qualify for movie status . I was bored for hours and hours . There is nothing original or fresh about this movie . It really is the worst in terms of plot and dialogue . I have seen it on video once and never will again . I would say go see it if you really can stand it . If you want to be entertained I suggest you watch the TV show Lost , not the movie version. Okay, I didn't finish the movie . I watched a couple of episodes .|0
When the movie first started I thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring . After the slow start the movie was a lot of fun . The movie is based on a true story I thought it was amazing . The main story is based on the life of Mary Smith who was in a loveless marriage . I didn’t think it was very believable but it was very true . The story was very sad . Mary and her husband separated because he couldn’t stay faithful . Mary became pregnant . Mary had a daughter she named Lila.|0
Wow . Just wow . Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad idea to have such a great lead. I'm going to see it tomorrow and am so glad to know I'm not the only one who was bored by the story line the first time they showed it . But i'm sure glad i didn't see it the first night . But the thing is , after watching the first 15 minutes of this movie i think i may just have to check it out . And if you have not seen it yet you really need to go and do so .|0
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game , this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll . But I have to say that not only is it terrible but I don't think that this movie should be released in a cinema. At least I hope that I won't have to be in the cinema next time this movie is showing in a cinema. If this doesn't make you sick, you might be more sick because of this. This movie is bad in every way that you think of. It would be so much better if the director had never been born.|0
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around, or that they are all the same.Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. But more important this is a great film.|1
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so I thought I would take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years.Better than I expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighting men and women.|1
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible . The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny that it was hard to watch for any length of time or any amount of money . . . but the actors were so talented and acted so convincingly that one would have to go through a lot to watch anything that is so poor . . . the acting of these two leads is quite amazing , however , the director did a good job in making the movie appear to be a comedy but in reality it is a boring comedy that tries to imitate a thriller with the same actors .|0
"I can get over the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a ""Masters of Horror"" flick.But, what I can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.To me it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington, and our heroes. I have family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the Arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH."|1
"The reviewer in Variety said this was ""overwritten and overlong"", and I kind of agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the US in kind of an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970's ""guy must find meaning in his life"" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal."|1
Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as `` The Fox '' in `` Whistling in the Dark , '' a movie about an unsolved murder in 1970s Los Angeles. The plot hinges on the mystery surrounding an unsolved murder of an actress in 1968 at a Hollywood hotel. Skelton, playing the detective, tries to track down the killer who may have been hired by a movie producer with whom Skelton was in an illicit love affair. The Fox, the name of the detective and his partner, is a parody of Sherlock Holmes, played by Frank Langella, with Skelton playing the part of Dr. Watson.|0
"Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic , but yet again its just another example of the media in general. What we have here is a ""celebrity"" with a ""legacy"" they've been trying to make of themselves for decades. The fact is though that most people (outside the media) don't have that same legacy. There is a huge difference, however, between being a hero and a hero. Many celebrities are good at what they do. I am a musician. There are a lot of amazing musicians."|0
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. The lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. I had seen it when it first came out on TV. Once more it aired when I had a VCR, but I did not have a chance to tape it. Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) I feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn.|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most over all. I mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. It's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. Just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game!|1
"Though it's better than most made-for-TV movies, ""Buried Alive"" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. There are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. The ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.The acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, as always, but Tim Matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"". Don't bother with this one."|1
Having just watched Acacia , I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here . I like the film but I don't feel that it's a masterpiece . I think it's a rather average film . I don't think it's up there with anything else that is made today . I'm sure a lot of people say that they loved the film . I hope that it is appreciated by many people . But I just don't think it's the best movie I've seen . I hope that more people will watch this film .|0
"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, ""Graduation Day""! All of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is, however, IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation."|1
"this is horrible film . it is past dumb . first , the only thing the twins care about is each other , second , it should have been more of a family comedy . the actors are too stupid . the family is too stupid . but , atleast the director and the story are good . so , overall , not a worst film of this genre . it is still better than worst family comedy

This film is just so terrible! I was very excited for it. But it is terrible. And it's just so predictable. It makes no sense as a whole."|0
I awarded this presentation 4 stars . They are all for the script , which has been butchered beyond recognition, as is the story in a manner that is hard to believe. I would have rated the script 1 if I had a copy, which I doubt is going to happen. This is one of the few instances when a film script could have done with an editor. The acting is solid, and there are a few scenes that are simply stunning. As far as the plot goes, I have no idea.|0
This film is a cash in . A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier film of the same name, this time, it's a much more straightforward tale of the adventures of a family of six orphans who set sail aboard the titular vessel. It tells the story of how the characters grow up and face the trials of the world around them, along with their own internal struggles. You can read all of the review's from the film, as well as, my commentary about the film, in the film's page dedicated to that review here.|0
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Guess I got it in the ear! It was funny and it made me happy. I have never laughed so hard or had so much fun on a television program ever. I think it was a good lesson in patience. The only other thing I like about it is that I had seen the same commercial earlier and I was laughing and not paying attention. There are two things that I think I know about people. One, you know what they like and who they like.|0
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it!|1
This movie was painfully awful. Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods, walking thru the woods, or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two kids who discover two 'horribly mutilated bodies' in the woods, return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really really night, its dusk, its pitch black, its day. All the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind.|1
This movie was so poorly acted. What was with Jeff Bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian?The script was lame. To have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the Jeff Bridges character...are you kidding me? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. Do these people just not believe in calling the cops? Okay...I'll get into the car with you, why not? DUH!|1
If a movie ca n't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes , it 's over as far as I 'm concerned. My favourite movie ever was The Shawshank Redemption, and this was probably the single best movie I ever saw in the theatre. It was also the best I ever saw in a VHS format, which made me feel better. It's a good thing I don't own a copy of the movie though, as I feel like I could have watched the complete film at home on a DVD.|0
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then proceeds with the story as told. It then moves on to the main antagonist of the film being the police inspector. There is a scene where the protagonist visits the police station for an interrogation while the police inspector is trying to get into a room in the station where the protagonist is. The protagonist finally gets into his room and then we get into the second part of the film. This part is where the film takes a darker turn.|0
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.It is one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like ""Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,"". When I saw that, I figured it would be yet another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff by Disney. But I had no idea how bad.Fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the T.V."|1
An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a taxi. “Hey, hey, hey,” said a voice. I turned around and it was a large, bearded man holding out his hand. I grabbed his hand and shook it, and he gave it a hearty slap. “What’s up?” he said. He had an accent that I couldn’t place, and he spoke in English. “How are you?” he asked. “Good, good.” “How are you?” I said.|0
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year 's best family film, Finding Nemo, but we did just want one more reason to like the movie. In an effort to find Nemo, Marlin, who just loves fish, asks his parents to go to the reef. They go to the reef, but when Marlin returns home, his father takes a picture of him standing under the fish tank. Marlin's father says he can show Marlin where to go, and so Marlin goes.|0
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel books. Counting this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i preferred greatly to this. It goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. I don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script.|1
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity.|1
"There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's ""Robe d'Ete"". It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl."|1
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks.|1
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round Lake Tommahawk I for one would not mind living there!All in all a great film to watch over and over again.|1
This film has some flaws , and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening . Possibly the most interesting aspect is that the film doesn’t really give us any real answers. It could be argued that there are a handful of ideas we can take from this, but those ideas all boil down to “he who has the gold makes the rules.” The story of this film is very much about the relationship between these men, and that’s about as far as the film takes the idea of them being in control.|0
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is . Everyone who sees it knows that the main character is not likable. He has a lot of reasons to make sure his life doesn't turn into what he has seen in his dreams . He doesn't believe in love , he is too focused on what he can get and not on someone else. He believes in a system that is based on money and his own life . And that is a very strong message for young audiences .|0
`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.'|1
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse.|1
"I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course as I'm sure you know that ""Malcolm's in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes ""The Amanda Show"" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure that we can all re-late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywood.SPOILERS AHEADAs it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems."|1

Please do not go see this. I did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes into this.I would suggest never seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was awful.|1

The girl's name is , and she claims that Fallon is the only thing keeping her alive. When she is kidnapped, Fallon must fight against a man, whose name is , to find her. After he's done, Fallon runs into a couple, who name themselves . They take him to a beautiful temple, where they give him a necklace.|0
There 's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by an author whose very name is in direct contradiction of that cliché. I am referring here to the late British author Neil Gaiman, of the internationally renowned comic book series The Sandman. Although the series began in 1993, and Gaiman’s first volume (The Sandman #1) came out in 2004, it was not until 2005, when he published his second novel, The Graveyard Book (written with Neil A.aker) that he would become an important literary figure in British society.|0
i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie . It really was one of my favorite films i had seen . It was an excellent comedy and i must admit i had no idea who this woman was at the time but i loved her as an actress . It seemed as if i had watched this film and then watched it again . I think i watched this film on the very last day we were there . It was such a great film that i am sure i will remember it for a long long time .|0
I am sure I 'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends ) , but I don't understand why the US government wants us to buy more expensive American products. The government is taking in more money from the American people. Why do they want more of our money? Why not take it in taxes instead? It would save us a lot of money too. I have a hard time buying it because the prices are always higher then what is advertised and the quality is not up to the hype.|0
"I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. I think it's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movie ""City of God"", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. I enjoyed very much the soundtrack."|1
I normally don't like romantic films, but I love this film very much. The story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel I really care for many characters in this film. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott until the ending scene. I want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the ending.|1
I 'm not sure whether i like this film or not . I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin Glover did an excellent job and the story could have taken a completely different direction . But in my opinion it was not good for children . I recommend it to my children that are at an early age but it might not be good if they are teenagers . It had a good acting but the plot was totally strange and weird .The film should have at least been called a horror thriller or a spook house movie but it was not .|0
I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life , I can't believe how bad I am . I think the movie is good , it makes sense in the end but it is just awful. The actors are good, its just the story that goes against everything. Well, it doesn't matter how good it makes you feel, that's not the movie's purpose. The purpose of movies is to entertain the masses. Movies are meant to be looked at and be appreciated by the masses.|0
Very poor script and acting . I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with such a poor script, and that he was able to get such an excellent production on his hands. I have to say, that this film has made me a better person than I was before watching it. The story, and the characterizations were very well done, and the performances were very good, especially by the cast. I can't say that I was impressed with the plot, I just thought that the film was good and fun to watch.|0
I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing.|1
In case you dear readers never heard , this movie was the main inspiration for last year 's Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson film, ‘The Avengers‘. And there were some good reasons to see it again this year. Not all movies are made for a reason (see: ‘Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith‘) and ‘Superman Returns’ isn’t like most movies. It was an incredible achievement in many ways, a true testament to the craft and art of comic-book cinema, but on a personal level it was also just plain awesome.|0
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, do not see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. It's a chore to watch!Set on New year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film.|1
"One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings, and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse).The story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. It may be a little below ""Seabiscuit"", but not a lot."|1
Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play . A murder has been committed and a bunch of people are involved with the case. It’s a very dramatic movie with a good pace, great performances and great sets. The movie’s a hit with the audience and the critics and is going to be a major blockbuster. However, there are a few major problems. One of them is the ending of this movie. Instead of making you cry for the deceased, it does nothing but upset you. The movie’s not a movie for crying.|0
Why would anyone make a film like this ? Why would anybody invest in a film like this ? Why would anybody do anything with this kind of money ? These were all very important questions and in many ways, they still are. But as with most things, the answers are not simple. You can’t just take on the world as you wish it would be, and even less, the world as you would wish it would be, if you knew what that means. There is an argument that you can make about whether or not that kind of money is actually worth something.|0
"I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression."|1
"A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a family of six, all of whom wear white clothes. He decides to live in their house after she tells him that she is dying and will die soon, and that she has only one wish: to meet the man in black. ""It's better if you just look away,"" he says, ""you can't see it anyway."" But as soon as he turns his head he sees her. Then he begins to talk to her, but he doesn't know her name."|0
Like the above poster , I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha ... This isn't the story I originally wanted to read, the story I was looking for was already written ... but it was too late to go back and rewrite the ending, so here we go with what I have, I hope you enjoy reading this Piranha! My name is Kyle, and I live in a suburb of Rochester, NY. For those who are not familiar with my hometown, this area is mostly rural.|0
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint. I was reminded so often of other movies, it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself, is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.BUT...See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever.|1
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. The twist is that instead of frail old L. Ron Hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood.|1
I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema . In the past couple of years , it seems producers and directors have gone out of the way to use violence , sex and nudity to get viewers on their side. The result have been a bunch of gore films , horror movies, sex and horror movies , and it seems that it is not going away anytime soon. For some reason , people seem to still find the horror , gore , nudity and violence more interesting than some other movies . So here is a list of 10 movies in the last years that you might like.|0
Hello all ! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would 've given an excellent performance, I was just excited to see a Tamil hero in a lead role and had no idea what to expect of his acting abilities. Well, I guess that is what makes this film a great one ! It's so good I just have to leave out the best bits for the sake of an entertaining movie. I have to say that, I liked Maniratnam's acting but the film didn't impress me the way it could have.|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I 'm a big fan of the Twilight series, so naturally, I had to watch this movie and see what it was about... I thought this was an amazing movie! I loved the story line, the characters, the music and the acting was excellent! I loved the end scene, I could watch it over and over and it was just a great ending. I couldn't put it down! This movie is a MUST SEE! This movie was very good.|0
All I can do is laugh . Wow . I like Jim Wynorski 's movies , I really do . But , he is the only actor in Hollywood that can get an Oscar out of it . As an aside , I read this interview with him back in 2008 , where he said he was going to make a great movie in the next year or so called ' The Devil In Miss Jones ' . I believe it was called that . It was going to be a comedy about a young boy , with a lot of sex and drug .|0
"I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially ""Uncle Benny"". I thought that Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. The story line definitely kept your interest and I hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. I felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say I didn't see it coming."|1
"OK , if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies , then you should check out the new Netflix series, Mindhunter , which is very loosely based off the book "" Mindhunter "", written by former FBI agent John Douglas, and TV series starring Ted Danson as the lead character. Mystery Science Theater 3000, AKA "" The Man Show "", is a popular American television series that premiered on Comedy Central on March 31, 1991, and ran for ten seasons, until February 1, 2005."|0
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. It started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. As they found dead bodies, or should I say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? At times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert.|1
After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon , I could n't quite figure out why so many people loved this film. I could understand why some liked it. It had its moments, i mean a movie needs to have its moments. But the movie in general had nothing special about it. It had its moments, but it had nothing spectacular to keep you hooked on it. A good movie should leave you a satisfied viewer. This movie failed at all those two. The acting was not good. The graphics were not good.|0
I loved it . In fact , I watched it over and over and over , and I could watch it over and over. That is one of the great things about books . You get used to them. And then one day you meet a book which makes you go back to it and you want to devour it, just to savor the experience, even though it may be just a little bit dull for you. And that was my reaction to the book. It is a lot like a film. And I was surprised that I liked it.|0
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . I got the first part with the Spanish subtitles , and I still found the second half a bit disjointed . It might have made the film better if it had included the first part as a prologue . This movie is definitely not for kids . I can see the appeal of it for some adults with a strong sense of reality . For those who think it is good , you might want to watch the first half in Spanish with English subtitles to get a good idea .|0
"OK, so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? ""SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH"". I thinking it has to be an older horror movie, because there's noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after The blockbuster hit ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original. That alone should have stopped me from putting it into the V.C.R."|1
There are so many things wrong with this movie I do n't even know where to begin . The story is terrible and has no plot. The acting has been atrocious and so are the sets. The costumes are bad as well. This movie does have its moments but it also has it's weaknesses. One example is the ending which is so disappointing. Yes there was a cliffhanger there but so were many other scenes. Not to mention there is one character that has been left out. Overall, this movie was horrible and a waste of money.|0
"Comedy? What's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time I turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? Set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. Served up with lashings of Hollywood's religious ""God will Save you"" redemption drivel Another Reviewer mentioned the ""Sassy dialogue"" of Tea Leone - well I managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and I still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than Tea's character in this rubbish."|1
"This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of ""extras"" delivering a film that turned out to be ""okey dokey"".Kermit's melancholy ukulele number ""Rainbow Connection"" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was beat out by Norma Rae's ""It Goes Like It Goes"". I'll pick Kermit's song any day!"|1
my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of BAD IMPROV but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient.|1
I 've seen this story before but my kids have n't . Boy with troubled past joins military , faces criminal charges for sexual harassment and assault. He's sent to boot camp and now has to serve 2 year sentence. He is serving his time with a girl who was 16 at the time of their relationship and who has a 9 month old daughter, who is in a state of shock. I am so sorry that your family is facing this nightmare, but they need your help. Please sign this petition, share it with your friends on facebook, email and text it.|0
Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games.|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies , I 've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint , Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson since childhood. So when my daughter and I saw their new movie ‘ Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’, I was more than excited. I thought that a movie featuring Harry Potter should have a ‘Harry Potter’ tag on it . But I thought that this movie, despite having a ‘Harry Potter’ tag, was a different story . The movie starts with what seems to be a fairy tale.|0
I don't know which was worse, the viewer's made dopes of, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. Am I to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed the child was a bit dark ? Am I to believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said, hmmm this child looks a bit dark ? Am I to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records, that Lisa Hartman had this wow look on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black !|1
"This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.We see little long-haired Jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (I guess poor Jack attained the wrong kind)."|1
"*some possible spoilers*Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the ""harmless"", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay."|1
What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster ? Not that much . With the average age of the cast being somewhere in their late 20s to early 30s most people would agree that this is something that many people might have seen before, but they are either too young , too old, or just don't care . In terms of plot there is just a lot of things that could be done to make this one much better . For the most part this movie is more of a showcase for the cast then it is a movie .|0
"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie."|1
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. ""What did you think? I'll tell you the next time you call!"" I said, ""What's funny, Paulie?"" ""Watching Hoods. I'm a total fan."" I said, ""You know how I always watch something every time you call, and you always call right away when you want to watch something, but you always don't tell me about it until we hang up. I never know what you're watching."|0
This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince.|1
Definitely worth renting ! Good clean family entertainment . My 4 and 5 year-olds ( and I ) loved it . We went there with our family to celebrate my sons 4th birthday . We loved it and would recommend it to anyone . The staff and the food were the best! It's a very busy restaurant so the food quality is excellent. The service was very friendly and attentive and we got to meet some wonderful people there! I will definitely go back! Food was great. Great service. The place is really busy on a Sunday night.|0
This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés.|1
Firstly, let me make it clear that I love aircraft, and usually any film with them in is worth watching - and I've sat through some shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this Strategic Air Command promotional film. The acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography.|1
"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) portrayal of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been ""created"" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself."|1
Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of Life. By the end of 19th century in a remote Japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than he, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. Henceforth in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man.|1
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect , but Rififi definitely fits the bill . No other film I have seen can match the atmosphere of this film , it is just so unique and special . I saw this last night and I was so impressed by it . There are times in life you meet people , and you meet them in the strangest ways . This is what happened to me while I was seeing this film . Rififi is a movie that should be seen by everyone . This review was originally posted on www.filmpioneer.com on June 6th, 2013.|0
This is truly , without exaggerating , one of the worst Slasher movies ever made . I know , it’s funny to think of this as “Slasher Movie ” , but I can’t think of a worse genre to name such a horror film . There is no gore , no blood , no nudity , no real plot , and no suspense . To be honest , I don’t even remember seeing the movie at the time , but that’s because I watched it in the theater and thought “Oh, my God!|0
It 's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film . Three main female deities -- wise goddess Parvati, earth mother goddess Durga, and the fearsome goddess Kali -- are the central characters here. They are depicted here as young women, usually with a lot of facial and body hair and wearing a lot of ornate clothing. Many of them also have big, bulging eyes. The film also features gods such as Ganesh (an elephant-headed avatar of Shiva), Bali (Brahma's elephant-headed avatar), Durga, Kali, and Kannappa, who is considered as a reincarnation of Lord Rama.|0
"One of the commenter's is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the ""Electric Chair"" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn't help matters."|1
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there.I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles.|1
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones , I wondered once again , why remake a good movie ? This time, I decided to go to a cinema to watch this new version of the French classic. But, while watching this film with a small audience, I was not really impressed with this version , but it was still worth watching . The story was very interesting and at the same time very easy to understand, even though the English version had some grammatical errors , because the original was originally written in French and has been translated into English.|0
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite , which I try to catch on TV every year if I have a chance, but this year I was on a very early flight out of town and didn't get to have it. A few days after my birthday we visited my family up north. It was a long flight, so we stayed the weekend. My parents live in a beautiful old farmhouse with a lot of history. It is a beautiful place. I was so happy that my Dad and Mom were there.|0
This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's spooky. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won't go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius.|1
There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.Here's what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer.|1
"""Opposing Force [1986]"" wasn't as good as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and it wasn't as good as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Heck, it wasn't even as good as ""G.I. Jane"", which is pretty sad.The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly IS the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones?"|1
I 'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70 's and early 80 's and John Candy is my all time favorite stand-up comedian. But, I never realized that John Candy would turn out to be more than just a comedian and entertainer. I wrote about the life of John Candy last year and I thought I'd do the same here on this blog to celebrate his life, work, and accomplishments. John Candy was born and raised on a small ranch in North Dakota. His father, George, was an excellent rancher.|0
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall . In many ways , this film was the end of the golden era of musicals that began with Fanny and Alexander . In the 1950s , it was all the rage in Hollywood . It was the kind of film that was made for families . It was not about sex or politics or race or money . It was all about romance and love in all its incarnations . From that perspective , it seemed to be a safe bet for Warner Bros . .|0
I do n't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy , and maybe I will in the future once it has become an obsession. What I do now, however , is just watch the ones I really like , like I mentioned a few moments ago , the last one I watched , The Three Stooges. This was actually the only movie I didn't enjoy watching, I thought it was really boring , but then again I am not very experienced at comedy , I have only seen one or two of their movies .|0
Another sequel ! Why on earth do they keep making these ? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever . I mean , why on earth make a sequel to an anime series ? The plot and story are the same as the original series, but the art style is different. And the music is too boring to be compared with the original soundtracks. There's nothing original to this. If you were expecting something more original to come out of this , then what exactly do you have ? You'll have to read it yourself to find out.|0
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good rendition of the story. I enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. But the second half was horrible!!! Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie Scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from God.|1
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt 's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing . Like a lot of bad movies of its genre this movie is made to make one laugh at its own expense or to shock . I guess that 's why people watch this kind of crap . I was really surprised how far this story goes with its characters . After a few seconds I started to believe that this movie could really be interesting . It 's not that much of a surprise since the story has some depth , but in the end it doesn 't feel like much has been learned .|0
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer on Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, ""From A to Zzzzzzzzz."" The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to ""civilize the savages"" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something."|1
This movie contains real animals been killed , like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been eaten by a shark . There’s also been a scene where a guy has been beheaded , a snake has been eaten by a pig and so on . There’s even a scene where animals have been taken out from a cage , to make a scene for a movie in the park . But the biggest part of this movie is when it was shown in the cinema of the people of the world . You can read my review about that movie here.|0
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. That's James Brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse?|1
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home I raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie Finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas Gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie.|1
It 's complete nonsense . I 've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the `` parallels with the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy were there from the beginning . I have read all I can from these two countries and I am totally convinced that what I am seeing is the real thing , no one is denying this . There are two ways to think about this . The first point of view is what is being discussed . That is to say , what I see is what is being done - and I have proof that it is being done .|0
when this show first came to Disney , i love it started watching all the time . It quickly became one of my top 5 favorite show in tv . It has a great cast and great story line. The only reason I don't have it more than 5star is due to the fact I can't seem to find a good copy at the price they are selling on Amazon . I have seen copies at the price of around $30 on Amazon . That's the only reason I'm not giving it more than 5stars . I really love this show.|0
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years.|1
I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film missed its marks. Several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. It sets you up for the laugh. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. They weren't funny unless you were five.|1
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.There's two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy.|1
"""The Man From Utah"" opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. This is how we're introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), heading into town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also happens to head up the rodeo committee."|1
"""Tragic Hero"" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. Also, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time.One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable."|1
"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, ""Camp Bloody awful""), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... Awful acting-check. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. It doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable."|1
"I'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new ""Doctor who"" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or BBC America; from season one we are introduce to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled last name sorry)."|1
If any movie ever made Italians look bad, this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I s--t on your grave. Seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly Mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right?|1
There are places for political commentary in film , but `` Masters of Horror '' is not one of them. Not since '' Pulp Fiction '' or '' The Omen '' have I heard a movie so devoid of humor. And the jokes are lame at that. I won't comment on what happens to our heroes at the end, but they are supposed to be the funniest movie I've ever seen, yet it makes no sense to me. There are a few moments of fun, but not enough to sustain the joke-fest that is going on in the background.|0
This movie baffled me. I could not get a grip on it. Thought I might be missing something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This isn't always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so I will...They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I don't get it??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL!|1
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie.|1
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.|1
The material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.Give this one a miss....even Yancy Butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.I'm amazed people rave about Yancy Butler.....given what I've seen here and in the couple of other things I've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.Last thing is where was this shot?|1
**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PLOT ****Woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . Oh did I mention the rape victim was mute ? That`s the problem with MS 45 , Thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? Surely the whole film would have better if we had Thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ?|1
... than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie . What was the motive ? The details of how the movie got made are beyond us. Why did they include a scene where the man was shot dead ? How could this be ? And why did they include a scene where the wife is raped and beaten up ? What was the motive for this scene ? In which way could it be explained ? The reason they added the scene in this manner can be easily understood . But it is difficult to find out the motives for these scenes . The characters are not at all developed .|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I wasn't watching it for free, I would have never finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever.|1
It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe.|1
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed.|1
"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream."|1
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey ( producing and starring ) was involved in ( but I can't find a trailer so can't judge that). Not sure what you mean by 'as good' as? You mean as good as his films? I've already said they're pretty mediocre, and they're just not that interesting. I mean, all of his 'comedies' were mediocre, and I can't see why you would go to the trouble of making one with him... unless you want to have him as the bad guy.|0
Lucio Fulci , a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety , ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in his new thriller . troublemaker begins as a simple investigation into a drug ring and quickly becomes about as far removed from that as you could possibly get . in this world of mafia and politicians , the only rule you'll have is that nobody gets hurt in the course of their investigations and nobody gets caught in the crossfire . this isn't quite true , but you'll have to get used to that in a movie like troublemaker , so we'll just put it at its face value .|0
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it? ""Return to Me"" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!)"|1
Sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. The movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall.

What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and was the victim of a double whammy in his teens. According to this biography of the young artist, he fell in love with an unknown girl who had a daughter of the same age (around 14) and he took the child away from her mother and married her. The pair then had six children between 14 and 22 years old and they lived in the Palazzo Barberini, a palace built as a symbol of luxury in the centre of Rome, which today houses the Museum of the Barberini Collection.|0
Ostensibly , Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother , a nagging wife , a domineering son and a hard-line father. He is raised to be tough, self-reliant and resolute. In his late thirties he meets an attractive younger woman named Maria . They have a child, and she dies giving birth to a second daughter. When he returns to Germany, he is determined not to let anything destroy his relationship with his wife. He is also determined to see his dead wife's family and the rest of his country. He has a plan.|0
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. A film worse than the postman,sizzle Beach U.S.A, Batman and Robin, Kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. I do hope that Troma or someone in America would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the French stench at it's worth.|1
"""Ahh...I didn't order no amazing hit show"".....""We'll you got one"" Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I flicked on the t.v. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate."|1
Well , first of all , excuse me for the lame pun in the title . I was browsing for a blog and decided to write a post of my own . Then my eyes fell upon your website and I am glad you had a good reason for having it . And I guess it will have the same reason if you dont mind me asking . Now let us continue with your post . Thank you for writing it and I hope you continue to have the opportunity to write more on here . Bye bye! Hey there!|0
I really enjoyed this movie . Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie , but Bruce Willis learned , from his time in the Navy , respect for people and the Navy . There was no disrespect in his character , he was a great example of the man that is willing to go to great lengths for what is right . I loved the movie but I do not agree with this statement. The story was good but a little far fetched. When you think about it, we do know that Bruce Willis does not have a father.|0
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when I came out I immediately checked into H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say I have been off the Hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since.|1
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). Julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London on its release. However Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not.|1
Get the CD instead. The show is tame, and the editing sucks. The crowd gets way too much screen time, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape it's recorded on.|1
One of my favorite movies . I like horses , I like happy endings , and I like Walter Matthau. I don’t know about you , but I thought that movie was awesome , even though I wasn’t exactly a fan of it . And I think that the whole movie needs to be rewatched . If you haven’t had a chance to , go do it now . Now . In this movie , you have a character that you love , and you want to get to know her . But you can’t go to her home , because you are not allowed there .|0
"The St. Francisville Experiment claims ""this ain't no walk in the woods"", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming! !I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's ""paranormal consultant"" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie."|1
"Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonize Venice. Idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. It is, absolutely, a"" memento mori"". and a exploration of illusion. A old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. ""Death"" is a Orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality."|1
"(This has been edited for space)Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola's ""Thérèse Raquin""."|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan . I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has a story that goes on and on.It is one of the rarest movies in the list of films to make you feel the magic of life. A movie which is very special.I would recommend it to a person who has been through the world and knows what the world is all about. And a movie which is very special with a lot of moments of life which are not told in movies. I have seen this movie so many times and always remember every scene.|0
This movie is amazing . You will NEVER laugh harder . It 's a target . No , I think your movie is perfect . The acting was awesome . I think this movie was a gift from God . The script is just great . I 've seen better movies . The way this movie ends is great . I think I will be able to watch this movie many time . I love your acting . Please make me a part of your movie. You are a wonderful director . I hope this movie is as much of a success as this one .|0
I loved the film `` Eddie Monroe '' . The film had all the components that kept me interested while waiting to see it, and it was a lot of fun . I would recommend this film to you if you are looking for an interesting film , you will be rewarded by it , I have a feeling the movie will keep you watching for a long time , it is very well written and has some very funny scenes , and it has some great music , and it is a great film . The ending was a real surprise , but the rest of the film was a good one .|0
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young , not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill , telling her story and trying to keep it together while everyone around her is watching . the story is told by her and by her father and mother , with a few flashbacks that give us insight into what happened to her life and what happened to her body . they tell her story as they have lived it , but she is aware that her story is a fiction , and she is aware of what she did to herself , and how her life has changed , because of it .|0
Some describe CALIGULIA as `` the '' most controversial film of its era . While this is debatable , it is also an understatement . The film was the subject of controversy and protests at the Cannes festival and has been the subject of lawsuits in France and Italy . There are those who believe it is a masterpiece of suspense and terror, others who disagree, and still others who are simply confused . It is not a film to be watched on its own, but as a lesson in history , in politics , and in psychology .|0
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of Best Actor nomination. His only win was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. He actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross.|1
"This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it's over you'll wish there were more. Well-written and compelling, this movie draws you in and holds on tight. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the performances outstanding. ""Nanny"" is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong, forgiving, protective, and never judgmental. ""Nanny"", to me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community."|1
"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the ""actors"" (With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the ""performers"" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The ""New"" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!)."|1
I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on `` Mystery Science Theater '' have received negative reviews. I know this is probably a good reason not to watch them, but after reading a good number of reviews, I would like to ask: What are the merits of the movies? Do you have any good recommendations of films that you consider worth watching? I am not sure how much I can take on, so my suggestion would have to be pretty simple: If you have not seen them, do NOT see them.|0
`` The Planet '' is an astounding piece of film making . For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned out a 3 hour masterpiece . And for a mere 10 minutes we have witnessed the birth of our favourite planet .'' The Planet's story is a metaphor for our society. The movie shows how the people who are now the ruling elite have exploited the people through a corrupt system to become rich and powerful. The Planet was made on the back of a small budget and took four years to create. It is a story of great courage and bravery.|0
"I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.I would highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.I turned off the TV during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. Calling it ""pathetic"" is a gross understatement."|1
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head , and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a case in point. The story of a middle-age Korean man named Bong-ho is about to embark on an epic journey with an older woman ( Park Hae-jin , a veteran of the action genre) who has been living in the United States for decades and has never left the city her family once lived in. However, Bong-ho meets a charming, enigmatic woman named So-ran (Yoon Jong-suk ) who is an expert in Korean history and a great believer in fate.|0
Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen , it is such a piece of shite that i just don't get why anyone would want to watch it. it is so bad that i don't even know why anyone would want it to air. and by the way why are people watching this show, if it is so awful, why do you want to watch it and why don't you just put it into the obituary file? The sad thing for me is i don't know what was in the minds of the creators of this series.|0
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA , who end up taking a trip to Bali. They end up being kidnapped and taken to a mansion in LA that is haunted. When they escape from the kidnappers, they will find out that what they saw on the trip is something much more sinister. They find out that they are being stalked and targeted by the mansion owner. They are being used as human bait by this guy to make a fortune, but it's much darker than any of them had imagined.|0
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script, but it was the script and story that drew me in, so I was looking forward to seeing it again. For me, the highlight of the film came at the end where two children are given to a man, and it’s implied that he is there because he was in their life to help them get better. The film is a true testament to that fact and is a story that everyone should know about. I can’t wait until the next one.|0
Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. Paranoia reigns supreme as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's sanity. I've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know.|1
"I'm not here to tell you ""Armored"" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel (""Charlie Varrick"") and Walter Hill (""The Warriors""). Those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. No skirts need apply. They unapologetically made guy movies. Guns, lots of guns. Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. Their movies were like a sap to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. ""Armored"" is so a guy movie."|1
"The first thing you should know about ""Zipperface"" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar ""home-video-ish"" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a ""real"" film. And ""Zipperface"" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a ""real"" serial-killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre."|1
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire.|1
CAUTION : SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times , the brilliant scenery , richness of the characters , and superb acting all make this film worth the admission. The ending was very unexpected . It is definitely the most anticipated film of 2015 . However , I do recommend watching this movie before reading this review. I really liked this film. The film was very entertaining and had a very nice plot. One thing that made this film really great is the performances of the stars. I would definitely recommend it to people who like watching romantic dramas with a good plot.|0
There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting , plot , effects , continuity , etc . The film has all these attributes. I can't give away too much of it though because it's not very long - but you'll know what I mean when I say it's a film that really works. The film tells us the story of an ordinary schoolteacher ( Nargis Fakhr-Khan ) and an extraordinary young woman ( Tannia George ) - who is suffering from a mental disorder - who are about to cross the path of fate.|0
`` Disappointing '' is the best word I could think for this film , especially considering the glowing reviews it has garnered. It's about a group of students who decide to join forces and take on an evil teacher who is using the school's students as part of his nefarious plot. Unfortunately, the evil teacher escapes with the student body and turns them into slaves to his evil ways. But we have to wonder: What if all those students turned out to be evil, as well? That would be bad for the whole group of friends, wouldn't it?|0
This movie was terrible . It is not something that people should have to pay to see . It looks like a low budget film that is being made for money . This movie will never be seen by anyone . I hope that the creators of this film will realize that they made a horrendous mistake and never make another movie like this . I think that a lot of other people will agree with me . I will say that there are many other movies on the market that are better to watch . This movie was awful .|0
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie.|1
UP AT THE VILLA ( 2000 ) * * 1/2WARNING : YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt 's hard to explain without spoiling the movie. The plot is about a young girl and her father who are trapped in a haunted mansion. It takes her a long time to get in and figure out the place. But she manages to do so by piecing together what she has seen over the years. It's a mystery that keeps the audience hooked for several hours. And there is a lot to think about. And not much room for a happy ending.|0
"One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit I never got into the original show.... Okay, so I never watched it at all. But the new show is impressive.Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows."|1
"For the most part , I considered this movie unworthy of a comment , but the last 10 minutes prompted the question , “Will they ever come back for the sequel ? “

I’ve been a fan of the franchise since I was a kid. I’ve never been to see any of the films in the trilogy , but it was my wife’s birthday so I decided to see the last film in the series called “ A New Hope“

To say that I enjoyed this movie is something of an understatement."|0
This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down, then moves back up into place again. The sound is crackly, and occasionally fades out then in again. In another scene, the camera man is just visible in a mirror.Then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent... which, believe me, went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer.|1
"I suppose I 'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt . These laboratory movies (and books) have always fascinated me because they show how science can transform human beings, and how science is a great equalizer for all people. But they also show the dangers that can accompany scientific progress, and what we need to be vigilant for. A great example is in the area of human reproduction. The movie ""Dangerous Beauty"" is based on the book ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"""|0
Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni . . . in fact, he's trying to do it the hard way. But the problem? He's no cop . . . at least not yet. He's just a guy trying to make it through his day. . . until he's caught between his work, his love for Julie, and being killed in the crossfire of two murder trials. Can he survive? And what is the fate of Julie? If you like crime stories that have a little of the paranormal in them .|0
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 's , others do n't quite make it, though they may be funny. He made one great short in the late 1920's, The Gold Rush (1929), which was well made for its time, but was a bit overlong. There were some great early silent films, though, such as Buster Keaton in the late 1910's, Charlie Chaplin , the first talking picture, with The Kid (1913) being a great success. Here are some of the best silent comedies Charlie Chaplin has made.|0
Although it is n't mentioned very often , `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' is a very interesting topic, in that it shows some of the most common causes of home improvement mistakes and how to avoid them. A person with a lot of time and resources is going to want to do something to improve his home, however, he is likely to not use the correct tools to accomplish this. Home improvement can be the greatest investment that one can make in his life, but it is also an incredibly important part of it.|0
"Big spoiler right here: this film is B!A!D! But enjoy, it's good bad.Bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. Since it's a Troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. The brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, ""%@#$!"|1
The Toxic Avenger ... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this villain had an idea that would bring good to the world. They would do things that would help the world become a better place. That was the idea, but it would be a good idea, because that was their purpose. The movie itself had many flaws and it was not exactly a perfect movie. First of all it was made in Japan, so there were many problems with translation. The first movie was not very successful, so they made a sequel.|0
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? The whole ""Complete Jane Austin"" series as a part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. Characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels rather rushed. The 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy though that ""Pride and Prejudice"" won't be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists."|1
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so forth. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic.|1
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in Colorado in the early 1900s. The group was known as the Lost Boys. After a series of tragedies and deaths, the group's leader, David Rains, took a vow of silence, and soon after he and his followers vanished into the wilderness. Years later, their bodies were found and they were re-interred in an old cemetery on the mountain. The film was a labor of love for director and screenwriter David Lynch, who had the idea of making a film about David Rains back in the 1970s.|0
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office ( OK - it was the quietest, most intense weekend of the month and we had an early night). And he really seemed to enjoy the movie - and not only because of the beautiful music. We've discussed it before and he's been an avid fan of anime since he was in elementary school. In the last two weeks he has taken to mentioning that he watches a lot of anime. He told me he's always been really interested in anime, but he had never seen this movie before.|0
No,no,no. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates,as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems like a colorized version of Psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Norman,and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folks,do yourself some justice. Don't bother with this.|1
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie . It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing else. The story is about a group of kids who have taken part in a sport. One day they want to enter a competition and have to win against a team from the school. We see their life as being in constant competition with a team, a school and a sport. They have to learn everything in the process and work hard. However they are always getting beaten by the competition. Thats where it ends and the story begins.|0
A very good film , focusing on a very important issue . Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect because it can cause lifelong disabilities . This film made me stop drinking from a whole different perspective . I was shocked to learn that I was born with this terrible birth defect . I hope this will encourage all mothers to breastfeed their children and help them avoid this deadly disease . I found this very interesting and would like you to do a follow up with this subject . My mother had 3 miscarriages in a row and then found out I had FAS when I was 14 .|0
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.|1
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in Paris and forget it's Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft.|1
It 's a shame . There 's an interesting idea here , but it gets completely lost in a confusion of the meaning of the word “possessive” when used with the phrase “it’s a shame .” I think that the problem with the “ it ’s a shame .” is simply that it has to be used with someone that we ’re ashamed to be associated with . I agree with you. The problem with the word possessive, and I think a bigger problem with “it’s a shame .” is that it is a word that requires some understanding of context.|0
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn.|1
I've never understood this type of spoof movies. You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots.|1
Admittedly , when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie , my expectations were pretty low. The film was based on one of the worst books ever written. I thought that I was going to see a bad movie , and instead I ended up seeing a bad movie . I was surprised, I didn't get what I expected . What I got was an incredibly entertaining movie that I didn't expect to like . The movie was directed by Paul Feig and stars Melissa McCarthy, Jason Bateman, Robert Downey Jr., and Bill Hader.|0
"The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata""(1978) starring Ingrid Bergman,Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson.It did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.It is time Film journalists like Khalid Mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. It makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of Hollywood and European films.You've got to give the film-maker something though. The film he picked for copying is one of Bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in European cinema."|1
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee 's `` She 's The Man 's Mother'' I have wanted to work with her and her amazing group of patients. And it is no coincidence that I have done work with them. It is not only Ms Merkerson, but with her, as with her patients that is her calling as a psychotherapist. It is not only the patients that she has helped in their healing that is of concern, but it is also the way she helped them that is most significant.|0
This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school, this was required reading in both languages.I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story.|1
"Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. Would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? Or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting ""older self"" Bruce Willis in a collision course with ""younger self"" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat ""fame"")."|1
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success ""The Gay Divorce"" (a title which was considered too scandalous for American moviegoers, though it was used in the U.K.) concerns a man and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. Betty Grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number ""Let's K-nock K-nees"" with overtly sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout."|1
"This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care.This movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. It's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of ""men""."|1
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison.|1
"I recently viewed a copy of this ( under the title 'Eaten Alive ' ) Talk about dreadful ! Anyways, here it goes:

Quote:

I just want to add something that I have found extremely interesting. I would like to know how it feels to be 'eats alive', or the equivalent of 'eated alive' in German. I believe that the German word 'gewalten' can be translated to English as 'eat', but I have not found the equivalent 'eat alive'. It seems that the German word can be used to describe a meal eaten with pleasure, or one eaten with relish."|0
I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful. Im glad that Casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority. Its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent.' I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head, as well. All the guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I cant wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, & Rusty!|1
I rented this movie , after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of `` five stars ! '' I had to check it out. I am very glad I did , as it was an excellent movie , one that I think will live on as one of the best ever . you will not be dissappointed if you do , as the plot is extremely well constructed and the acting by all involved is excellent . although there is a lot of action , this movie is not as intense as other action movies of the same genre .|0
What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders.|1
"There is a point in the film where the female boss of the ""death machines"" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive I think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. Except such is her delivery that it sounds like ""leatherage."" At which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The boss lady had to do the talking as the ""death machines"" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does."|1
Got the chance to see this at a friend 's house today , and was impressed with what it achieved in such a short run- time! I was really impressed , especially when I saw how it worked in such a simple form- it is the type of thing I would like to see more - I was hoping that the people at the exhibition would be able to give us some insight into this kind of project - but of course , that was not to be! Still, the quality of what I saw was quite impressive - and I think that it would be really good for those that wish to see it!|0
Sometimes , things should just not be made . And while the set-up seemed good enough , it proceeds to be just that , making things , not just the good, but also the bad , the right , the wrong and so much in between . And when it was time to play , the results were spectacular . The game has one of the best music tracks that you will hear in any game ever . The music is very good , you will find it hard to put down the music for the first ten minutes and you will feel like you were in a trance .|0
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground.|1
This film could have been great- but was n't . Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the Establishment, this is the closest we've ever been to seeing a good film and actually making money at the same time. The story of a young man with a dream of being a singer who becomes one in a small town was interesting, but the rest of the film had nothing to do with music. This is the film where we see a young woman who is willing to take any chance to make her dream come true.|0
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character.|1
Ca n't say this was n't made well . At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took too long to be filmed. One of his stars was killed, but that was because of technical problems, and the producer made sure that it would be on film at the end of the show. The film could have gone on for another hour, he says, but it would have taken longer to get him to the end of it, and more time for the crew to set up. To some people, the time it takes to do things like this just seems wrong.|0
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB). About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star Hugh Grant or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences.|1
I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The dialog is cheesy. Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he's supposed to be from.|1
This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look.|1
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way : I was walking down an aisle at the Cinefamily, and I came across a movie that my sister and I really, really wanted to see, and I thought I had it, but when the lights went up, the screen was black, and the film had ended. I assumed that the theater had lost my ticket to that particular film. I looked around to make sure no one had walked out the door. I walked over to the concession stand to see if my movie had come with a free drink.|0
"`` Tumbling Doll of Flesh '' by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse , torture , and kill an innocent teenage girl and then force her to take part in an orgy in order to blackmail the man who raped her into having sex with them. The girl is raped repeatedly, then the three men hold her down and cut off one of her breasts and use her blood to create ""tumbling dolls of flesh"" which they force onto themselves and then take home and have sex with her again. The blood from the breasts of the dolls are then used as makeup to dye their faces."|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books , so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was made into a movie . . . and I had a lot of problems with it . . . because I loved the book and it was my first book in which I played the role of a young boy , and in the movie I play the role of an adolescent boy . . . and the movie doesn't do it justice , and it's kind of disappointing , and if you haven't read the book you probably don't want to see it anyway .|0
Think Jumanji but with a death curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. Supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. Okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.Frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy has run but certainly its not the best.|1
I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case.|1
I 'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book . Given the number of characters and subplots, I wonder how many reels of film were required to shoot it. Did the producers know that the movie was based on a novel by an award winning author? If they did, would they have hired an author to write the script? And why did the movie need to be so big? I'm not a movie buff, but it seems like it would be difficult to have a big budget production without having a good script and a good director.|0
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens . It showed up again on Netflix the same day, and I thought I had missed it. It seems that they've decided to put it back out there. So far, there have been about five reviews and three user comments. I'm going to wait to see how much more of it they release before giving my opinion, but from this, it looks like they are trying to fill a gap for the film, which will be interesting to see where they end up with it.|0
Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema . ( 1 ) Your average Hollywood movie or 2 ) The worst of B-movie. I liked the latter, which I’ll get to later . It’s not like there are a lot of B-movies that are as bad as this one . I think I might be the only person who thought it was bad at the time of watching . I thought I was going to be shocked by this movie when I was first shown it on TV . But I couldn’t have been more wrong .|0
"I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is ""Airborne"". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie."|1
Yeah , what did I expect ? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point. Instead , i got a story about people with a lot of pain. So it was a great surprise, when I saw that this film is all about the pain that people are going through after their children left the family and they are forced to take care of them. It is a very emotional film and i totally recommend it. So , here it is. I saw this movie because my cousin told me that this will be my next movie of choice, and he is right about it.|0
I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years.|1
"This `` film , '' and I use that term loosely , reminds me of the first joke my daughter told me when I visited her in the first grade , when she called my wife and me Mom and Dad . "" What kind of a name is Daddy's little girl , "" she said . "" It's a very funny joke . "" We laughed at it together, but I never did figure out whether she was kidding or not , and I never heard it again . It is the best joke that I ever had , and I think you know what I mean . """|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is the equivalent of Citizen Kane ? No, of course not. It is a different type of cinema, one that has evolved into a new genre, one in which we don’t really know what we are watching and that is probably the best way to say it : a postmodern art film. There is a tendency in the art world to use this new term and to describe something that is different, even though what is different is the subject, and the subject is no longer the same.|0
I 'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park 's Thirst is exceptionally well made , but spending over two decades crafting a new film in his style is no simple feat. In fact, it can't be easily done. I 've watched the director's films a lot over the past 25 years , so I should be able to recognize the stylistic flourishes Park has been applying on his films. But there are certain things in his work I still haven't quite been able to spot. So I decided to do a little digging. Park has always been interested in music and film .|0
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person. This movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. The dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. The chick of the movie is such a cliché.|1
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric , or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never tire of a good scandal? As the dust finally settles on a controversy that was bound to become a huge media circus, there are a few salient questions:

Was there really a plot to discredit the U.S. film industry by targeting a group that represents a growing percentage of the American film-buying public? Why was it that the controversy exploded when a group that represents almost no one except the most diehard moviegoing public is the one that was targeted by the filmmakers, but then disappeared without explanation after the dust settled?"|0
To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES.|1
"What ? - that was it ? The town sheriff ( John Agar ) blows up the mutant gorilla with a grenade in the climax. But there are plenty of other things that could have been said to make for an interesting climax. Here are a few more. Trouble with the Narrator
I think one of the problems with The Dark Tower is the fact that you don't actually know whether Roland is talking to Roland or to Roland's dead father. We know he is talking to Roland, but the fact remains that they're two separate narrators."|0
well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly.|1
"Not a box office success; no-one really knows why. It may have failed simply because of its title. It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Hard Weapon"", ""Die Lethal"", etc. - talking about ""the long kiss goodnight"" will get you nowhere. But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie. A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on."|1
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series.|1
"The Hell's Angels did come out the losers in this movie. Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were stoops to even appear, much less be ""technical advisers"" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. Hell's Angles on JAP bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, ""F$#K Harley Davidson!"" and that if they was smart, they would be riding Hondas."|1
"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment."|1
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut's between important parts. And leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all.|1
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like. Most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it adds up to make a perfect story. All the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough.|1
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan and as someone who loves reading Austen, it’s hard to see the movie without loving the book. The film opens with a flashback to Jane’s marriage, which we follow through as we see it through the eyes of her family. There are no surprises here, no twist, no turns, just Jane’s story as it happens. It is refreshing to see how a book that’s considered a classic for so many people is portrayed in a more personal way.|0
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story.|1
This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norris's best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks.|1
I find it amazing , that so many people ( probably Poles ) have voted for this movie , giving it a good score of 5.5 stars , but not giving it enough points. I have seen many a movies with a similar story and this movie had an awesome score , but it lacked something , which I cannot see on a big screen in 3D or in 2D, and that is depth. I have seen many movies of a similar genre, which have more depth , and have scored more than 7 . 5.5 is not enough for many people.|0
"This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. After the introduction where we are given the backstory of ""something"" killing a couple people in a farm house, We are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - AND NOTHING HAPPENS for a looooong time. Then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for a very long time. Then FINALLY the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. Then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends."|1
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better."|1
Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane.|1
This is an excellent , little known movie . Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie . The only bad thing in the movie is that I wish that the movie was a little bit shorter . The plot is not bad at all and I don't think that this is Tom Selleck's first movie and this will be his last . And I like his style of acting . He has a great voice , and even if the movie was a little short , I would still recommend to see this movie . Tom is one of my favourite actors , and I would watch anything that he's in .|0
"""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie."|1
"What bird is that ? A maltese falcon . The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines' accent. And he is not even that funny in the movie. He is a very funny guy , but not in this movie. In fact the movie has no funny lines, except the one he comes up with , ""I don't eat cats"". Thursday, July 5, 2009

There is something about this movie that seems so familiar to me , I wonder if it has ever appeared in a film before."|0
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film . It was very very rushed , as I suppose you would expect from a Hollywood release . I am not sure if I would recommend this movie but I will share my thoughts and opinions as they stand . I first saw the movie at the cinema just a few years ago , but have not since . I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it . There was a big difference between the two movies I saw and this one . The first was very dark and violent in it's approach to violence .|0
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.|1
"this really is an ""okay"" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving it all..so here's the recipe to get a great show."|1
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies.|1
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a lower class Northern British setting. I find it a very sad film at parts, at others cuts are where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie. I only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end.This movie completely loses the attention of the audience.|1
It's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. There just isn't a lot to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs.Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here. He's not one I would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. He's a fine actor, anyway.Everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. That was a surprise.|1
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.|1
I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another `` Biblical '' film again , if Noah 's Ark is any indicator , or if it hasn't already been a total disaster on every level, and I know it seems like a long time ago, it's actually been a week. And, yes , while we're at it, I have to admit it's been two days. I guess we're supposed to take whatever we're supposed to take . I do have one small hope for a new version, though .|0
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see.As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics.|1
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter do not have a choice about our bodies and we cannot change them. We have to take ownership and live with ourselves and no one else. If we are strong and take care of our health by eating well, making sure we get enough rest and exercising regularly, that’s awesome. However, when we are told we are ugly, fat, unattractive, etc. that is not okay for me and my daughters and it’s up to them to change.|0
Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste ' is not all quite there ... its so funny , its just that when someone like you has a bad review of a TV show and yet you defend it to the very end , you just look so silly ! I don't understand what's so funny. I don't really care for the show, but I'm glad I haven't been the target of it. I would have loved to post my review but I don't have enough points. Maybe it would be different if I didn't have the same taste as the majority of the people here.|0
Sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the surface when she is confronted with the realities of life in the United States. This is her story. It is also about the people she loves. In the last year, three things have occurred to me which may prove helpful to those with whom this story opens. They are my experiences of my own life, my journey as a young woman with a history of drug and alcohol abuse and my journey through my marriage to a man I did not love.|0
"From the crash of the opening theme, ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" is classic 1950's entertainment. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood, where the old scumbags still lurk. This is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and almost steal the show."|1
"Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"", which covers remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic."|1
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade , a half human , half vampire known the daywalker . He has the perfect blend of sex appeal and strength to be an alluring lead. He's also a bit of a playboy with women. Blade doesn't have any problems getting laid and he isn't shy about asking the ladies where they got their titties done . The first time I met him I thought I was having a heart attack from his intense gaze . He was playing some video game and just stood there and stared at me like I was an insect .|0
Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldn't wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn't need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary.|1
Like a lot of the comments above me, also I though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as I will explain a in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking.|1
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns . Have a look at some of the western films of his to get a sense of the challenges he was dealing with . If you are looking for a fun movie that has some decent western elements then you might consider this . However, this is not a film for the casual movie goer . This is a serious attempt at making a western . There is some action in it , but it is more than enough to hold your interest .|0
"Yeah, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""American Pie"", which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get?Attention, spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before."|1
Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren 's missing brother. It is the early 1930's and the brothers Agren are still in their late teens at a time when there's no money and no prospects of any, as the two are sent to find Agren 's missing younger brother who had run off to the jungle after his father and was never seen or heard from again. It is said that Agren 's father is a nobleman. Agren is the youngest of the three, and the oldest of the two.|0
"I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good , and I watched a video on it, so I thought I may as well check it out , it was very entertaining and informative , i highly recomend it to any fan of the series, and also to anyone who has ever played it , i would definately recomend this game to anyone

Wow. This video is so amazing. I think I have never seen anything like it. There's so much good information in it. I love this video and the people who make these videos."|0
I 'm sorry , perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 , perhaps it is part of the response to what happened , perhaps some of you have some sympathy with him , since he is a fireman , I have not, however, lost any of my respect , at least I have not so far. But this is just one more example of why I think fireman are so loved , because they do what no man should do , they do what no man wants to do , and that is go and put their life on the line , for others, and for themselves.|0
"( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie , I think he likes it too . ) It took him a while but I finally figured out that there are a few different ways to do this in real life, and I went with the easiest. What's the trick? There are a couple steps that you have to follow to be sure you are creating the same effect (or similar) in both of the movies:

  1. 1. Create the Himesh effect as close as possible in both the movies."|0
I like Steve Buscemi . I like his work very much , both as an actor and a director . I have seen several of his films . I am sure I will enjoy watching more of his works . This is the 3rd of his movies I have been able to watch . He seems to like doing both , so it is like watching two different shows . The first is his films as an actor . This one is a comedy , with the exception of one of the funniest characters I have ever seen in the movies .|0
I do n't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about , the main characters are all so stupid, and it's not really that interesting. But if it's an actual movie and it does have an interesting plot i can live with that as long it doesn't have stupid characters like the one's in the movie. This movie is just boring... I am a fan of bad movies like this, but they all end the same way... and i really hope that this movie gets better in its storyline, the main characters all were really annoying.|0
While this movie did have a few scary moments ( great use of music and film angles to build suspense), the movie itself is a pretty normal movie. I would rather watch this film on a big screen with my friends rather then to watch this with my girlfriend. It’s not the kind of horror film I would usually watch but I’m always up for watching this kind of movies. Now, you know that this isn’t a bad film at all, especially when you take in all the praise that it has gotten.|0
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's.|1
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. What?! That's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.|1
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a turkey and the some. What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive I think so).|1
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water.|1
Have to agree that this movie and it 's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve . Here 's why . First of all the story is boring as hell . Even the main character is dull . Even the story has no real twists and turns . The best part of this flick is the action sequences of the movie . The only thing that is interesting about this movie is the way in which the plot has been developed . This is one of those films which I would watch , but it would rather be watched by someone who has never seen a war movie in their life .|0
Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling . It also starred Joe Estevez , Gregg Thomsen , and Robert Osterloh . The film had several other stars from television, such as Bob Denver (who had a small role in the film), Richard Boone , William Schallert , Alan Hale, Jr. and John Anderson . In the movie, Schilling plays a woman who has to escape from a group of people who are trying to abduct her and take her into their world. The film had mixed reviews and was only a moderate success with only $5 million in ticket sales .|0
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do . I was unimpressed and bored with this film . I am a huge fan of Captain America , and while this is a fun film it would have benefitted greatly by removing the subplot about the Avengers . The Avengers is one of my top three favorite franchises of all time . The film is fun to watch , but to be fair I would have liked to see the Avengers get together . I'm going to try to find a positive review of the film on the internet instead, because I don't really remember much about the film except that it was awesome .|0
There was no need for this movie , plain and simple . The original , although hated by some , was a well written film with a good ending . It could have been made into something special if the story was changed . I am glad that the sequel went into a different direction and was better . This movie was a huge mess . From the first hour to the end , I did not get a single moment of enjoyment from this movie . From the start to the end, I felt like I had just taken a dump on the screen .|0
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of an older woman. Lackawanna Blues is based on the best-selling non-fiction book by Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Story of the Great Plains, which has sold over 35 million copies and been turned into a number of television programs, movies, and even a stage adaptation and Broadway play. The film’s setting is a fictionalized version of the North Dakota village where Wilder wrote the book in the early 1900’s.|0
Set in Hungary in November 1956 , this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to escape the then-communist Hungarian government for the UK. What happens on their journey will make this a film that will be remembered for decades to come, and it's not just for its political and historical context. What makes this work is the characters themselves - their motivations, decisions and thoughts as they navigate the world. When we last left them, the three main characters had travelled together to London and set off into the unknown.|0
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again . From the first image released by the French authorities , it was clear there was nothing to fear. There was nothing to be done at this point. And I believe they did nothing at all. There was no reason to suspect anything. I think they knew what was going to happen, but did not wish to see it. I am very surprised by what has transpired in the past six months. What I saw on TV, I saw many times before. It is not so very different.|0
High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels(Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of.|1
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful.|1
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting locales, great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one.Sadly, Andrew Keir has passed on & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series many times yet a DVD release is yet to happen.The series is one which is timeless. It is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day.|1
SPOILER ALERT ! Do n't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot of potential. The acting was terrific. The cinematography is gorgeous, and I loved the score. There were some flaws, as I said though, but it had a pretty interesting story. I liked the direction a lot, and the performances were good, even if not top notch.I 'm not too crazy about the final product. There were things that I enjoyed and things that I didn't enjoy. It seemed like the writer and the director didn't really like each other very much.|0
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi ; it 's a shame . Big Bugs , Snakes , Mythical Beasties , Dinosaurs , Aliens …. all these things have been discovered in the Earths history , which are not the truth . But to the Big Bugs and the Big Beasts , they think , the Big Beasts have discovered the truth of the Earth . They , these Big Beasts , were told about these Big Bugs and Big Beasts , they believe these facts . These facts , in their eyes , confirm what they believe to be fact .|0
"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor , but this `` movie '' left me stunned in many ways and I won't try to tell you what was in the movie, or what really happened, but let's see what I think:

If there are a lot of questions left, I'm not really sure what to ask. It was not that bad a movie. It had a lot of potential and it tried to be more than it ended up being. I've seen better films and movies than this , so I'd say it's pretty average ."|0
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film , after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the movie, the other films that come to mind are A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and War & Peace, which I feel are a bit overrated. Although Mad Max is a good film, it’s a very different experience from Mad Max, Road Warrior or War & Peace. This film is about a family who are trying to survive in a post apocalyptic post war world where there are no more humans, animals, plants, or minerals left.|0
While not truly terrible , this movie is still largely a waste of time , and paints an incredibly inaccurate portrait of reality . In this story, a woman from a poor neighborhood of a major city goes to work as a cleaning lady at a wealthy man’s house. When her boss catches her in the act of cheating on a man who is paying her a salary that is twice her wage , the boss threatens her with a series of punishments . She is to be beaten every night , and is made to kneel with her head in the noisome garbage can for the entire length of her shift .|0
"Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in, from comic, to tragic, from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a ""talk singer"" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I."|1
"The minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. Then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.This was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (It displays some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's earlier ""Brute Force"")."|1
`` You can survive anything '' . Anything except a dumb horror flick . The director could n't even decide whether to show the movie from the point-of-view of the dead or from the perspective of the ones who survived . the director did a good job of making people laugh at the point-of-view that the survivors are telling the story from . that is why there are not many zombie movies that do not end by the death of the hero . but the thing about horror movies is that they dont end . they just never end . in fact , the best zombie movies are just as much horror films as they are horror films .|0
I worked on this atrocity ten years ago . Luckily for me , no one knows it because I did not want the story known . It was only in my own mind that it was my doing and not the other way round . In the days that followed, I was attacked by some people from another country who were angry because they thought the story was too good , too funny or just because it was not true . They thought I was just making something up. The worst thing that could have happened to me is still in front of me .|0
"This noisy, dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy, who could have tackled the role played by Mr. Stone, the team doctors, or the ""fruitcake"" selling cereal. If you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. The film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some MTV-styled music video scenes."|1
Computer savvy John Light ( as John Elias ) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon . But it’s not all fun and games and money. Elias has a secret. And one day he’ll use that secret to go down in history. In 1996, at the age of 19, John Elias left the University of California at Berkeley to pursue the dream of starting a tech company. It’s no coincidence that it was the technology boom that allowed Elias to pull this off. In 1996, the Internet was a science fiction fantasy.|0
If there's anything worse than this movie I don't want to see it. I remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blast away any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.|1
Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good.|1
A very good film, focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children struggling with this world wide. The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented.|1
Okay it is terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. C'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman, and, my personal favourite, Roger Ready. Yes, B star John Agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a NASA experiment gone awry. The movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting.|1
"A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean ""laughs"", and it doesn't necessarily mean ""light"". It basically means you're not bored while watching it. As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience."|1
Wow ! After the first five minutes of watching this `` film '' , I was quite tempted to put it down . It has been a very long time since Hollywood has had anything this interesting . After a while , I felt I could not take it any more . Fortunately I didn't , and soon I found myself entranced and almost laughing out loud . This is a movie that I would really like to see a few more times . It's a good thing there are so many other films in the same vein . I think that is a good way to learn .|0
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate . It is an hour and half waste of time and space. I thought I would take a look at this and try to see if there were any new theories that would add to the knowledge that was already known. First off, there is nothing to love about this movie . Nothing. None of the people in this movie are likable or appealing or interesting or interesting enough to be made into anything interesting. They are simply not . And yet, we keep watching and wasting time .|0
Ever since 1981 , Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda . Most ideas and concepts in game design originated with Nintendo but many other developers later copied their work. One of those developers was a company called Nintendo Research and Development, which began as a subsidiary of Nintendo's research and development division, then later became a separate company. When Nintendo launched the NES, its main competitor was Atari. In 1982, Nintendo hired the famous game designer and programmer, Gunpei Yokoi, in his first job with Nintendo.|0
Bad , bad , and did I mention bad ? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the film is that at the time this was supposed to be directed by Michael Bay, and to top it off we got Tom Hanks , who I’d actually rather watch than Bay , to direct. Anyway, here’s some of what the film was about . . . 1- It starts with a man and a woman sitting on the couch with their kids watching TV. As they watch, a man comes into the picture.|0
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.|1
"Leslie Carbaga 's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer 's big move of their film cameras to England, and the story of their film making. Tuesday, 20 September 2013

It was in 1938 that Fleischer left his native Austria. The film was set to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock for RKO and was intended to be used as a fill in film during the war. Fleischer arrived in Britain by air and took the film on the London to New York ship. They arrived in New York on 8 May. He stayed in America until June of that year."|0
I first saw this movie in the theater . I was 10 . I just watched it a second time, and again and again. When I got to the part at the very end where he gets to his car and it starts to rain it was just the right ending for me. I could easily imagine myself in his car as I walked through the rain out to my parents house. I was watching this movie at home with a few friends last week. My favorite scene, for obvious reasons, was the first time they were at the store.|0
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after years off the drug. He meets a woman whose life he ruined. Sinatra, who was born in nearby Wrigleyville, got his first acting job at 14. He was discovered by an old friend when he walked into a theater with his mother to see a play. The man who found the young man and encouraged him to go on to a career as an actor asked him to join him for a drink in his basement.|0
"If there 's anything worse than this movie I do n't want to see it . I remember so many years ago seeing one of them and saying ""this will never get a movie!"" I don 't know how anyone could go on with a movie where a man has to climb into his car to be abducted and taken to a different planet. I don 't even want to see it because it is such a downer movie. That said, if that is the case and I do see it , I 'm going to enjoy it!"|0
Some sort of accolades must be given to ` Hellraiser : Bloodline ' . It 's actually out Full-Mooned Full-Assed and we've only seen the first issue. But it seems the comic is worth every penny of the $4.99 cover price. Not only is the story pretty interesting, but it is written in such an engaging way that it is guaranteed to bring new readers into the book. The art by Mike Allred, who I think is a top drawer talent and the story is just great. I hope it comes out at full-moon too!|0
A great film . Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew . The actors give credible performances all through the film , especially Takahashi and Kishino . It is a very well directed film . My favorite aspect about it is Toyoda’s acting . When he is not directing, he’s acting . It’s like he’s taking on his own character in the film . You can see him trying to carry out the role of Toyoda . And he tries to make the characters seem real to us , even if it’s not realistic .|0
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after the other in an attempt to avoid having to take a test (they're not there to help him ace the exam), and then not doing the same thing in the same place as the next stamp, in order to create confusion.That's not an excuse - but it is an explanation of why there are so many differences in his story, and why so many things are not in there. He didn't have any exams to take, so how did you know the questions weren't in there?|0
OK, so maybe it's because I'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like the guys in this film, but I found this great fun. Cheap fun to be sure, but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually quite effected when they died. In particulare when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well it;s a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered.|1
Dr. Pena ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , a `` crypto-zoologist '' ( fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who still thinks that bitcoin could be the key to their fortunes) , is not happy with the price of the bitcoin market. This is very clear if you examine his twitter feed. But, he is not the first to have a problem with the price of bitcoin either. In fact, the problem goes back to when it was worth more than $100 and he still believed there was a major flaw in it.|0
I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and I watched a video on it, so I was really into watching it. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like, I have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool.|1
"8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had basically ""phoned-in"" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.But upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.With the exception of Spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot ""longer in tooth"" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v."|1
I can just picture how this movie came to be : '' So how else can we screw up our lives?'' I'm sure he's been thinking along the same lines. He must've been in a lot of them, but I know they're just as bad as the other ones because they're even worse, but they just don't get the coverage. They don't do anything to change the world and people have to live every day to the fullest. They don't change things, they just change the way people go on living and they do it just to get attention.|0
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing.|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.|1
"I found West Point to be an agreeable film, although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's ""Huddle"" (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking."|1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices.|1
Just saw this movie on opening night . I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it. What struck me was how much I was reminded of my childhood and young adulthood. This movie reminded me of the life I lived when I was a kid. The things that I remember about my time in that time were things that I wished that I would have done better of. This movie brought back those memories for me as well. There was a lot that I wish I would have done differently in the way I handled my situation with my mother and my boyfriends father.|0
Loved this movie ! Kicking it old school ! Love the idea . Love the script . Love the characters in it . Just love the way everything is presented in the movie. Awesome ! And it is a good movie. I really like it . There is a little too much of a drama in the movie. But I love the way this film is being shot . This is a very good idea for a new kind of horror film . There are so many ways to make a great film . The horror aspect of the movie is great to watch .|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help.|1
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!)|1
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I have never seen such a cheesy film, but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction, and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins. Goodness they just don't get any better than this. Rush and buy this tape right away.|1
I 've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one weaves together the elements of several classics in one story. That said, it takes a little getting used to, as the book and screen version are more or less opposite of each other. It also has its flaws, not the least of which are some minor character choices and a couple of things in the script that don't work. But it still manages to hold it's own with all that and is worth a watch for it's own sake.|0
I always loved this film . The music , story and the action . I especially love the opening and the end . I saw it about 5 years ago, maybe a 6 year old kid . I loved every minute of that film , its not the same as the book , but I still love it . It has made so much difference in my life . It made me who i am now, a strong woman and a proud mom . I have to say that I would recommend this movie to any woman who has ever been a victim of any type of abuse .|0
They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make her case. The point being that women can do so much better and live the lives they want without having to worry about getting knocked up or going to school. When I was growing up, the women my mother taught me had no way of making a living if they chose to be home schooled. If they didn't want to go to school then they didn't have a choice in the matter, they were expected to have a family and take care of them.|0
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics, they released Irreversible and a range of Bergman's opus.The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's strangely titled film MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr Joe Average, replete with voices in the head, visions, and madness. It's set in rural redneck Australia, the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many Australian movies.|1
This film is a very beautiful and slow film . There is nothing Hollywood about it . It is very well composed and shot . The actors are good . I do not believe that any actress can do her best in this film . The best thing is that the actors are very natural and are not overdoing the role . The movie is great . The film is about two friends , who have a lot of secrets and try to keep them to themselves . The film has a strong and mysterious atmosphere and a good ending . I like the character of this film .|0
"The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for ""emoting"" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would neither recommend nor watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue."|1
I never read the book. Now I don't really want to. I had no clue what this movie was about when I walked into the theatre. I still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but I do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. Two precious hours I can never get back.The storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. Werewolves...or something...a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. And I was correct.The acting isn't horrible.|1
"When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole ""i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff, oh noes what is happening, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait i see something spooky, oh never mind""-sucky storyline."|1
Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It 's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the fact that men don't want her (even though they're her husband's friends)and that her life is meaningless.The ending is just the beginning and it's not too long. I thought it was good.I really liked the main character, but I did find the ending to be very disappointing. It seemed like there were some things in her head that needed to get sorted out, but the ending was the ending that really let her off the hook.|0
"I won't spoil it for you. Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what I mean after you watch it) Poor story. B-rated movie quality. Typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. I should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add ""quotes"". Just tells me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. I wish I could take back the time I spent watching this."|1
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL and kills all of his fellow crew members. But Van Damme can’t get it together to kill himself. The movie doesn’t go where it should and doesn’t develop the characters. I liked the movie a lot, but there were so many technical problems that I stopped watching after about a third of the movie. And the final half was just dull. If Van Damme can’t kill himself with his bare hands, how is he still alive?|0
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! It was showing on a Sky channel over here called ""Zone Horror"" which basically shows crappy B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. Apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was OK, LOL!!! In all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors."|1
I can only think of one reason this movie was released . To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Fawkes. The only reason you can't see it for yourself, is if you are caught with it . I know because I was . It has been years since I've read a review of a movie I saw and have since forgotten about . I went to the theater to go see the Guy Fawkes movie with a group of my friends. We were about a quarter of the way through and I was bored. I sat down and thought, what's the point of it?|0
"This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder, ""Where is Ralph Macchio?"" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, then Myiagi can come along and add some more! Macchio could've been the love interest for Julie in this film! Never mind!On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what Daniel's were."|1
Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. At the final scene, I was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.Only one name in it I ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must've been very hungry to take this part.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! !|1
"If you Listen to Ween (The Pod, God/Satan), then you know what's going on with ""Split"" I found that watching the film under the influence of LSD helped to deal with Audio/Video tracers from fantastic editing job. The plot was only important from second to second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...There just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level."|1
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production . Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top of the range of contemporary British actors . A very enjoyable film . The story is simple, the dialogue intelligent and the acting superb . A film that will please most people of all tastes . A good film , if you care to consider it in any light . This isn't the usual sort of film, I'm sure you know what you are getting, but I found it quite enjoyable in the end.|0
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in its treatment of this Swoon over does it by far. Worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. While it is an interestingly made film, Swoon stinks.1 out of 10 - awful.|1
When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget.|1
The first time I saw this film I was a kid . I was ten years old when it was released, and I remember how I reacted, as though it was a new revelation in the history of art . It is a masterpiece. When you're young you are attracted to movies like the first time you see it , you can't believe that people actually think like that and act like that. If you look at it from that perspective, this film must be the best film ever made . It is simply perfect .|0
Without doubt , GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of `` AAA '' level stars and musicians ever gathered to form a musical ensemble. It is a musical phenomenon in its own right. I can say without fear of contradiction and on the word of one who is a witness, that this band is the greatest band in the world. This is the most magnificent band in the history of musical achievement in our land. I have seen them perform and I have seen them grow, mature and mature even more. The one thing they are known for is their love and commitment to each other and to the band.|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS, no mater how expensive they were.|1
There are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. It's always good to remember, that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god.|1
Fred Williamson , one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars . Cynthia Rothrock , one of the two or three most beautiful women to appear in the genre . And one of the most beautiful women of all times . In the late '40s, Rothrock was hired by William Wyler , who was looking for someone to star opposite Robert Taylor in a film called 'The House of Rothschild', in which they would play the title role. The film was never made, however, Wyler's interest was sparked again when Rothrock was spotted by one of his agents and he had her meet Wyler at a party.|0
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids , this movie centers around some freak named Mike ( the guy is called "" mike "" to save space ) . the movie starts with him coming home from college after a night out with a girlfriend . the girlfriend ( played by the ever amazing rita goldston ) has been drinking and tells him that she cheated on him . the movie proceeds to chronicle all of his attempts to get over her . the movie centers around the relationships that these guys have had with their significant others ."|0
"What is this ! ! its so bad . The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 animation . . . it doesnt seem like a anime , it feels like something out of xmas. It has been an hour since the anime ended and I'm still watching the last episode. In a matter of two seconds, the whole anime went to crap. This is how the anime ended for me:

I don't really know what to do about it. I'll try to find out how to fix it. I feel bad because I didn't like it but I guess I didn't."|0
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick , and I 've always been a fan of the character in the movie , from the beginning of his career . in the movie we find out that when he was 5 years old he had a dream , in which his father was trying to take him to heaven , but all he ever wanted was to be on earth again . this is when his father dies , and he goes back to earth for his mother , to take her place in heaven .|0
After reading some of these reviews , it is apparent that some have missed the point . What is great about this film , is that it doesn't attempt to do anything particularly new or original . The point of a good horror film is not to do what nobody else can do . It should make us want to see what we've missed . But that is not to say the film doesn't try something new , or does not attempt something that is not seen before . There are several good ideas in this film , and some very interesting moments .|0
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.|1
As we are well aware, movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history, but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation. I wish the director and/or the screen writer had done his/her research in this topic. All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a rift that should not be there. This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while making the third group (Hindus) look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations.|1
"Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. You'll enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. I appreciated not having to be concerned about ""questionable elements"" in a children's film for once. That, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film."|1
I cannot understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company,but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic(Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to grant it the same BOMB review they gave it in the 1970's).With so many scene stealers on display,Sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role.It all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15AM,but Sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon!|1
It 's schmaltzy , but then what else did you expect ? The heroine is Cinderella 's younger sister complete with a dress , shoes, and a prince. It 's the same basic concept that made you fall for a series of fairy tale retellings from a young age, so why not do it over again ? Unfortunately , this adaptation feels like the work of someone looking for a fresh idea rather than a filmmaker interested in telling a good tale from the start. There are no surprises or revelations and while the story is engaging enough to keep the viewer interested through the first hour , it ultimately leaves you disappointed.|0
"As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The ""creature feature"" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone? ), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying."|1
Well , I did n't know what to expect from 555 . Matter of fact , I had never even heard of the radio before I had this radio in my car . Anyway , I must say I am very impressed with the results that this little device has provided me so far . I am sure it will continue to provide the same quality of sound that it has provided me with so far . And I am really not kidding when I say that I am impressed with the results that this little radio has been providing me with so far .|0
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the death of a friend. Stewart (James Stewart) is visiting the home of John Wilkes Booth. When he enters, Booth is just returning from the theater with his wife Mary (Joan Barry), who is also the wife of Abraham Lincoln's assassin. Stewart, of course, falls in love with Booth's widow, but she's not the kind of woman one would choose for a confidant in times of crisis.|0
As cute and adorable as they are , the story of three singing chipmunks just does n't seem to have caught on in the way they were originally meant to. So, in an attempt to find the magic formula to make them a real hit in the music world, I went out and wrote the story below. If you're a fan of the Chipmunks or you're just someone who wants to see what life would be like if they were real, you should probably read this. I wrote the story down here on this blog, but feel free to read it if you like.|0
"It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "" Bigger and better "" but I'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - Rumours . But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004 Channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston . Yes that Christopher Eccleston an actor I've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true ."|1
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sound familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this has got to sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just have a heart attack and die from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades? wet bandits?...oh wait, that last one's been used) try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled (Druish?)|1
"A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast . Not even one in 20 Americans has heard about a H-bomb, the largest man-made explosive ever created

The world's most destructive device was used on August 2, 1957, in the second of two tests by the USA and Soviet Union at the Nevada Test Site, just outside Las Vegas

The first test on October 8, 1957, created the largest explosion in history

This is one of the largest explosions in world history. The H-bomb blast is so powerful that it has been called a 'giant atom bomb'."|0
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead . There is this gap between life and death, when the body is no longer able to be seen, to be held. When we are in the middle of something and the mind is elsewhere, we are not able to experience it. You have the ability to hold the image of life in the mind, but you cannot experience that image, unless it is a very clear, clear image, and it has been taken away from you.|0
This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs and a group of men trying to take him home. We soon realise the film is not actually about the boy and his dog and that they are just being used to make the story more interesting. This leads us to a scene where a young woman (Natalie Portman) and her father (Michael Douglas) have a drink in the bar of a large hotel as the camera pans over to her mother (Sally Field) watching.|0
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . Billy Dee plays a young black revolutionary in Harlem who meets a young white girl who he falls in love with and has an abortion . His girlfriend, a black lesbian , runs away with another guy and leaves him to die of dehydration in the ghetto. The white girl eventually dies on her own. I liked the story, but it didn't hold my attention much. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, because it seemed like more of a melange of two of my least favorite genres.|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds ( probably left over from the snowstorm in the first half of the film ) appear in the opening scenes, one after another, making me think that this film might have been going to be somewhat of a disappointment. But in the end it was far better than I expected, and well worth the five stars it's been given. The cinematography of the shots of the snowy cityscape, and the city streets, are both beautiful and very atmospheric. The performances by all the cast are strong and believable.|0
"I thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of ""national security."" The show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. After a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and I started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead."|1
"Chan-wook Park , you have to hand it to the guy . In my eyes , he 's not only one of the best actors in Hollywood , he's one of the best male actors. I don 't want to say , ""great"" in this case , but he 's the one who can act the most natural, likeable , and relatable . I really admire him . He 's still doing his thing and I love the fact that he's just one of those guys , who always gets his way. He 's just like me , I can relate with him ."|0
"Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is ""nott"" very good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. As I hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is ""nott"" even worth the bandwidth.Up until the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills."|1
Okay , that was just brilliant . I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong . It would have been so awesome . And it was a lot better . And now the show is even more of an all in show . Because they don’t have to explain everything that happened . Just let the episode do what it did . I mean , they really don’t need to explain . Because you already know everything that happened . The show is the story , and that was a very smart way of going about it . This is why I love the show .|0
When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. He is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and American dream-working class hero trash (which I'm not). I don't get it. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on!|1
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really could n't understand those who did n't like it . But I have no idea why. It was very enjoyable for me and I can say that I felt the character development was very good. So, as much as I liked Season 3, I can see Season 4 being better. Season 3 was a tad bit too slow, too drawn out. I think Season 4 should be faster, more like an action adventure. Maybe the new season could even be a story told in first person.|0
As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager , I tend to watch all sorts of movies but have never been big fan of documentaries. When I recently saw The War on Drugs, I could not believe my eyes. What was this movie? Well, the movie is about a group of ex-cons from the ’90s, who go into seclusion after getting out of prison to make their own movie about their drug experience. The whole movie takes place inside a theater, which makes the whole movie very bizarre.|0
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood . The plot has many twists and turns, with the end result leaving one to ponder if he has understood the true meaning of life or if he has missed something. This is an entertaining read that keeps the reader guessing till the end. A story of survival, this is an engrossing novel that combines both genres; suspense, thriller, and science-fiction all in one. The author introduces us to the idea of time travel and explores the concept in this story.|0
My wife and I could n't even finish the film . Truly , it was rather painful.First , the historical inaccuracy. One scene (the last) was an actual event , that was filmed in 1957 . When the movie was made in 1998 , all of the men who were supposed to have been involved were no longer alive . Then there was the over-the-top ending . And then there were the people who didn't believe in evolution . But , it was not meant to be . I guess that is the only way to make a movie about creationism .|0
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past.|1
Between the ages of 30 and 51 , when he died of a brain tumour , Zachary Scott made 70 million dollars from a single game of golf. It took him 11 years to break even on a single game, but it was the beginning of his professional golf career. He was the highest paid athlete in the U S in 2016, earning more than $30 million from endorsements . A decade before Scott made it big, he had already become the best amateur golfer in U.S. history and had been crowned the best amateur in the sport in the World Amateur Golf Rankings in 2004.|0
"This is an odd movie. On the surface it's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out. Firstly, the main killer character is really weird. How the heck a guy who only ever clucks like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me. What was that female parole board member thinking: ""he's totally reformed and rehabilitated"". He clucks! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script/direction for the women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine I'ld slap her."|1
"I 'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon . I 've seen only 4 episodes but what a show he is ! I'm really addicted to this guy . It seems to me that this man has the ability to tell stories that are very interesting and captivating . I've never seen any other television show to have been able to take me away to another world with his shows. I've never watched a movie that did that and I've watched many tv shows and movies and I've yet to watch anything that I would describe as ""magical""."|0
While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer.|1
Let 's get things straight . I was raised Catholic , and in a very religious family , and spent much of my childhood attending Mass and other church activities with my siblings and many cousins . We went to the church every day , and were taught that we should not make our faith into anything other than what we saw in church . As a child , I attended mass on Sunday , and never once felt that the church had anything more to offer me than just what was offered at Mass . My parents were very loving people , and very devoted to the church .|0
Given Christopher Nolan 's string of successful films , it 's a no brainer for me to want to check out a movie about the Dark Knight , the most recognizable and popular superhero of all time . After all, Batman is not just a character that lives in comic books, he lives in our hearts and imaginations . But is this the best film I can get from him? This review contains spoilers , but don 't let that put you off. I think Nolan has been making good films since his first Batman movie was made.|0
I'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. Instead of legitimately dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).|1
"this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great . Nothing is good Bloodline ... I will never go back to hellraiser

Bloodline: Hell on earth
I really like it. It's different from all other films I've seen and I can't imagine any other director taking on Hell on earth. The storyline is excellent, the story is a good twist on a horror/thriller genre. The film does have a lot of blood in it but it's very minimal. I feel it's not as gory as part 3 but not as intense as part 1."|0
Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! !Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know?|1
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM , so I had the opportunity to see it before it went out on cable. I really liked it. It's got some good parts, and some real funny parts, and some parts that just make you laugh out loud. Some of the acting is actually really good, like the dog, but some is really bad. There are also scenes that you can't understand because you are watching it on a TV, because the sound system isn't good enough. But I will tell you the truth about it.|0
THE NEXT KARATE KID , in my opinion , is an excellent martial arts flick . I thought that Eric Tseng’s previous work was very interesting , I like his idea of a Karate Kid version of “The Shining” . In this karate film , we have the return of John Candy “ The Karate Kid ” in a new role . As a result of the film not coming out during the summer , it has a bit of a ” late entry ” date . I did think that the story was about as interesting as it was ” kiddie ” .|0
Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters.|1
"Rock Star is a `` nice '' movie . Everyone is nice . Even the guys who are n't supposed to be nice . Except for one guy who is actually a jerk . And then we find out the whole movie is based on a true story . Plot Summary:

Rock Star tells the story of two aspiring rock stars who go on tour together to promote their new song ""I Wanna Rock You."" However, upon returning to their small hometown in Ohio, things take an unexpected turn as they soon discover that they now live in a world where rock stars are hated by everyone."|0
I have to agree with the previous author 's comments about the excellent performances and plot . Started watching this series back in 2009 and I am really enjoying it so far. It is definitely worth a watch for the plot, the acting and the action. I hope to see more stories in the future of this series. I really like the way it is being told and the way things are moving and I hope to see this series through to the end. I hope the next one is a continuation of this. This is definitely one of my favorite shows.|0
"I was expecting ""Born to Kill"" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. Instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a ""glamor"" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after ""Dillinger"" (an overrated movie but at least better than this)."|1
You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen.I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork.|1
This is a very low budget film , set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of climate change. We are shown that we have to deal with the change and it's effects on the land, plants, animals and humans. We are reminded, that in the movie , there is no place to go , there is no place for people to go to escape their conditions and to get away from these people who are destroying this place and making it impossible for them to live there in peace. The movie ends with what might seem like an idyllic dream , but it's really not .|0
'Carolina Moon' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. Turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset.|1
Now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz.|1
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman 's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home instead of him having a love story with the girl at work. In the movies, I don’t care what happens with the guy next to me — or what happens between my boss and me — but if I can relate to it I’ll watch it. If I can relate to my job, then maybe I’ll do it. So what happens next with the everyman, who does a job that is more than just a job for him?|0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . Incredibly bad . Very pretentious . It would be interesting to see this film with a different director. The acting is bad. The story sucks . The plot is a complete and utter rip off of The Dark Knight . This movie is a complete waste . There is absolutely no plot, only a movie . The acting is horrible , especially the kids . There are some funny scenes but not many . There is no tension , no drama . The ending is pretty lame . I am disappointed in this flick .|0
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!! !the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props.|1
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV . I only wish I had seen it more than a few times , because as a movie , it is so well crafted and the performances of all the leads are perfect , it really felt like a concert movie in the sense that there is never a dull moment . I saw it twice and I would like to tell you the best thing I liked about this film is that it is very very funny but at the same time it is also very serious in some way .|0
"'Water ' ( 2005 ) , the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta 's elemental trilogy has been a box-office hit, earning more than $100 million worldwide on an initial release of 300 theaters. It has been lauded by critics as the strongest of Mehta's works yet. Deepa Mehta's 'Water '

This film is based on the life of Canadian writer and activist Gita Mehta and follows Gita as she grapples to reconcile her Jewish upbringing and Hindu faith with the violent conflicts in her community. The film's title is also the name of the community in which Mehta grew up."|0
This movie clearly has an agenda , which could be summed up like this : Never , never cross the line to the right of the left , no matter how tempting the temptation is , and always keep a cool head under the worst of situations . As a general rule , however , this is not what happens . This is not an action movie , and it is not a war film , it is a movie about how to live life , how to live life with style and dignity , how not to be driven around like a slave by life's problems and issues , how to get what you want .|0
First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot.|1
I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore.|1
"Some movies you watch and you say, ""Well, that made no sense."" And you don't really mean it. You're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical. ""Bread And Circus"" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. From the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. There's no script. There's no plot. There's no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.So what?"|1
"James Stewart plays Johnny Mason , lawyer . Carole Lombard is Jane Mason , wife . Lucile Watson the mother-in-law of Jane . John Wayne as the father-in-law of Carole Lombard. The film is based on real life events. 1. Cast of Characters

2. Cast of Characters

John Wayne

John Wayne was an American actor, director and film producer. He became the first person in history to be offered a five-year contract for $5 million and was the subject of one of the 20 most influential actors in world history by Time magazine."|0
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala ""Ocean's 11"", and pin it on the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated."|1
"In Thailand , the Americans Connor ( Colin Egglesfield ) and his girlfriend Amanda ( Meredith Monroe ) quarrel in their apartment, and Amanda says ""I think you should just take a nap, and if anything happens you're not to worry about it, but if you do, just tell my uncle and he will take care of everything"" . ""What's the first thing you'll tell your nephew if he asks you to take care of the problem?"" asked Connor, as he watched his girlfriend kiss and kiss her way to his bedroom ."|0
"I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or David Arquette's ""performance"". It was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER!!!!)."|1
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time.|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made . The story is disconnected and it is difficult to take seriously . I think it was directed by a guy in his 40's because the character of the main character's parents are all adults. The story revolves around an American family and their life in a small town in the U.S. . I am not sure what to think or say about this movie . It is so badly done and so depressing that I almost wanted to watch it to forget it completely . There is no humor in the story .|0
I expected a lot more out of this film . The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out for myself. To my surprise , the film was nothing special . The plot was pretty lame . The acting was decent but nothing memorable . The music in the film was pretty decent too . The film is pretty average to me , there were a few small things that caught my attention about this film but nothing more. Overall the film wasn't good . If you want to watch this film just rent it .|0
"I am utterly astonished at how over-rated `` Cemetery Man '' is among horror fans ! Now , I usually enjoy most horror movies , with or without good acting , I am a diehard fan of the "" classic "" era of Horror movies. I also have a very low expectation of any movie , no matter how much hype or how much money the movie is going to get . I have seen only a few good , good , good "" bad "" horror movies and that is it. This is not to say that I have no expectations at all of the movie ."|0
I am partly a fan of Miyazaki 's work . I say `` partly '' because most of his films are not particularly good . Miyazaki has an innate ability to make his themes seem more interesting than they are and has made it his habit to take risks that many would deem too risky or too far out of character for an animated film. There is a reason that his films are known as ''manga '' and his style has influenced many directors since he began making films in the '50s . He is one of those people that we look back on with fondness .|0
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd.|1
"There are two things that I noticed in this film . ( This is not a spoiler , just a observation that was made)
1. It’s very reminiscent of another film, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which has been out since I saw it. That film has two things that made it special . First of all, both the characters and actors in the movie are superb. Secondly, the director is a master of the genre he is working in, so he knows how to tell great drama ."|0
Never having read or seen the Bard's original work, I can't begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.|1
"This film is great! Being a fan of ""The Comic Strip Presents..."" I just knew I would love this film. And love it I do. I finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. However I was annoyed to find that it had been cut! So I'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked!"|1
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches . Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the final ten minutes . Even then there were some interesting ideas here . A lot of this film I thought was pointless . I have seen it twice now . I would recommend it to you but if you're going to watch this it would be a great idea to go and see it with someone else . It's quite boring in fact . The plot does make sense at the beginning and then as it goes on its becomes more and more ridiculous to me .|0
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie , like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.' And that's not a bad comparison since the movie takes a number of classic monster movies and gives them a 'Twentieth Century Techno' twist. There are a good number of genre clichés here. We've seen them all, though, with this film being no exception. It takes place in Los Angeles, California, which is not a typical location for a monster movie. So what is it then about this place that makes the film so effective?|0
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance , a tour de force . His acting as supposed washed up beach stud has a genuine sense of menace and vulnerability that comes from a man who knows he may not live to see his next meal . Cassel gives an outstanding performance , it's a showy performance that is well worth paying attention to . He really has a presence in this film and is one to watch when the film comes out on Blu-Ray on February 1st, 2016 . Director David Cronenberg does not pull any punches here . There are many shocks and shocks that happen over the course of the film .|0
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. Actually, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. It isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.The story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent.|1
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. It is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.Not quite ten years after the film, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work.|1
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. The locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. It just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. Only in the Mediterranean I guess. Certainly in no world I am familiar with. The macho men were really obnoxious, and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long.|1
Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company in the early 1930s. This was her first film role, and Astor got top billing, but for the most part, the film is all about her character and her struggles in her new role. Astor played a woman who wasn't afraid to fight for what she believed in. The movie also stars James Stewart as Astor's boss. The two were married during the making of the movie, and the pair also appeared together in a later movie, This Happy Breed.|0
"This movie will not be considered for an academy award , but if you enjoy a movie that does n't make you laugh , or you like to watch a story that is a mix of comedy and drama , this movie will be an enjoyable one to watch and you will enjoy every scene . ~~~~~~~ ~~

The story is one where a man ( mr. rahim khan ) lives with his wife , kids and dog in a house that is made of mud and sticks. His family consists of his mother who is mentally ill ."|0
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever the heck she is. Chauvelin would not randomly shoot Tony in the head.|1
Eros and Thanatos , Love and Death command the dialectics of Life . By the end of 19th century in Italy, this relationship was already a central element of the philosophical debates. This book analyzes how Italian philosophers of this period developed this idea, focusing particularly on Benedetto Croce. This approach, in turn, has its origins in an investigation carried out in the first years of the last century, when the author was a student at University of Rome, where he discovered his mentor and friend, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa.|0
There seems to have been some money behind this film , but it would be impossible to imagine a film like this on any other platform. I have a few friends that have no clue that the film has been released here in the UK, which is not the way to attract new audiences. I have always been a fan of this movie and will revisit it again and again, but the fact that it can only be seen on the home theatre is just another reason to buy your DVD and Blu-ray combo pack on the day of release.|0
"I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. As I lived this situation and get lost in it, I hope a similar story would inspire me. My major concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) the triangle forms ? - Why (c) & How (d) the triangle degenerates ? (a) The movie offers a plain answer: ""because it's better !"". (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together."|1
Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. Kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named Trigger Hicks! ), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Constantly-smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes Trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! No amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by R.K.O.|1
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he 's a great actor ( Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind ) . But I think that his work is somewhat limited . He can act very well in a lot of different situations but he is a great comedian and the one thing that always bugs me is he is not very funny in certain situations. I'm not even talking about his acting in comedy films ( The Cable Guy . The World's End .) This is not about his acting. He is an actor and a comedian (and probably a great actor ).|0
"Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical ""junior high"" experience. They make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. I can't stand the fake French accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually ""fall"" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parenthesis? Because its all stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit the Mary-Kate/Ashley mold?"|1
Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead . I suppose only institutionalized lunatics would want to watch it for that reason but I will watch this because it has an ending that makes perfect sense, a happy ending that makes sense and makes my heart smile. It’s not as if it is going to turn me into an evangelist for the Catholic Church or anything else. I mean the ending makes sense in so many ways that it is hard to believe it didn’t happen the way it was intended.|0
Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments , but I have to disagree on a couple of things . -I have no problems with people getting a job and having to do something that doesn't agree with them . There are plenty of jobs for people without any degrees or training. But I think the job of a lawyer shouldn't be any different . I know I would hate being a lawyer . It's what I have been doing since I was 18 and I could have been working at McDonalds or working at the mall for all I care !|0
"When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here.One of the other users commenting on this states ""This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart"". I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is ""classic"" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality."|1
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively . Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi, which is why I want to visit that part of Vietnam in the future. I’m glad I took my camera with me. I don’t know what’s going on in the world but I hope for the best for my country. I just watched a movie about Vietnam. I am in the USA now. I love movies. I am a movie addict. I love them to watch them on my television, in my bed and even on my computer when I have the time.|0
Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS `` event '' . There's a reason for it -- and one reason why he's such a master of pacing . Jackson is a consummate writer, too, and he's not afraid to let scenes linger and let the pacing build to an explosive conclusion . The film opens in New Zealand on March 18 with Jackson on a fishing trip with his wife Fran and their two children . He wants to be alone, but the children get his attention and ask him if he's going to shoot the movie they saw in England.|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters and humour

I had no clue this movie even existed and I was thrilled to hear of it! (I was a bit concerned that this could have been '' the bad canadian movie'' that everyone was expecting.) I liked it as long as it was on for the entire movie and I never got bored of it, but it did get tiresome to see so many characters in a short amount of time."|0
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime , i stumbled upon this movie and i found it really interesting and fun to watch . It is a romantic comedy directed by Anurag Kashyap and starring the famous actors Abhishek Chaubey and Sonali Bendre . The movie tells an interesting story about love and relationships of 2 young people and is full of humour and laughter . The main story revolves around the relationship between these two young people , which is quite amusing to watch , and i love the love story in the film .|0
When I think of a 1970s-period film , this is not what I think of . I do n't want to make any reference to this era, as I hate nostalgia, but it is just as important as what is happening in the present. This is not a film to watch for that reason alone. But I am going to put that aside and just enjoy this one. And the film does have a good plot, too, though it is far more simplistic than what we have been subjected to in the modern film industry.|0
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one . i do n't mind that at all . i just hope it is good . and hope that i will get to see the movie the same time as you will when it comes out . i do hope it is good. I've been meaning to check out this film for some time now but have never gotten around to seeing it. I don't know why it took me so long. I don't really like the genre of fantasy films but I'm looking forward to this one.|0
"This was a great movie. It had one ""sot-so-nice"" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot."|1
The 1998 version of `` Psycho '' needed to be set back in the 60 's , rather than present day , but it was a hit with fans and critics and the film could have been a success without it. This year , the movie is a remake of the original, with the script written by Steven Knight and directed by David Fincher , but it doesn't feel like an adaptation and the movie takes place in today 's time , not the 1960s , with the main difference being it's set in the city and not in the suburbs.|0
You know, I really hate IMDb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. But here we go. Editing time!Holy moley is this bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow I've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is just abominal. It's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him.|1
Though it 's better than most made-for-TV movies , `` Buried Alive '' is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge flick . The action takes place in the late '70s, when a group of young women are lured into the basement of an old house and brutally attacked by the husband of one of their attackers . Then, with one quick, brutal kick to a man's back , the women have their revenge on their own. Unfortunately for the film's cast and the audience, there are a couple of very serious problems with `` Buried Alive ' .|0
This show is terrible. I cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. This is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. I have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.What the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights.|1
Boring movie . Poor plot . Poor actors . The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco . There is a lot of sand on the floor but it doesn't feel like sand . There is a lot of sand on the walls but it doesn't feel like sand . There is a lot of dust everywhere . There is a lot of dirt in the room but the characters don't feel dirty . But why is there a lot of dust on the floor? Why isn't there dirt on them? Why does the floor look like it hasn't been cleaned?|0
I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was.|1
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins , comes the Following , a movie about a couple of guys and women, that find themselves in the middle of an epic and dangerous adventure that will change their lives forever . following , in all its gory glory is a movie that, in a word , is good. it has great acting, great writing and a story that is well-paced , with a very interesting twist at the last act . it is a perfect summer movie . the only problem ? it is a movie .|0
"Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It 's a good movie , looking at after war , psychical problem , love problem , marriage problem and other problem in the movie , and how they handle the problem , and how they handle other problems . I am waiting for more movie in same genre in 2010 . This review has been rated: 5.0/5.0 - Good
Good movie. It is not perfect. There are some things missing in the movie. I liked this movie because of its story and dialogues. But some of the characters were not so great."|0
Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who set up the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him.|1
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.Don't miss this movie.|1
"It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that ""Aeon Flux"" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around."|1
Wow! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) Terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. Lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film.|1
"OK , most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake , but at the same time I am sure many of us can agree on at least two points:

1. It's a great idea, and would make a really awesome movie. 2. It will be very, very hard for Hollywood to make. The film in question, however, will have to wait. I don't know why. There's no need to go to the theater or watch it on video because there's no way you could know what was going on, much less understand the subtext."|0
"Not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie. Gunshot effects are downright horrible. Acting is ""meh"" It is nothing like Far Cry, other than names and the very basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting are completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in northern-ish America in the movie).I loved playing Far Cry. I loved the story and setting."|1
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just don't fly, do it? Why then has it received so much praise?|1
"There are places for political commentary in film, but ""Masters of Horror"" is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another ""Bush is bad!"" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a ""message"" film, be a little more sly about it."|1
"What is night vision ? Well according to the star ( Williamson ) let 's see ... one package store, where the products of this store are sold is located ... on the roof top of this one building ... I have seen the image of the star ... what does he mean by this ? He seems to be referring to the building and roof top of this store ... According to the image of the store ... a very bright star is visible to our eyes ... the star is called ...

Well the star is on the building roof ... and visible to the eyes ..."|0
Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham.|1
When naïve young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser at Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role.|1
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the film.I think that if you hadn't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling)...).|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward...granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be, but i thought this was amazingly well-acted, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in exectution. i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play, it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick. i am also a great fan of alan rickman, so that might be my bias.|1
This turned out to be more of a women 's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was .... simply a story of two very strong women who could not live together as they wanted to and needed to separate so that one can continue their work and have the other for company. But the story was very interesting and you could see how both women were willing to do everything to succeed in their lives. It is not an easy read, and it makes me a lot less hopeful that we will see movies like this much in the coming years...|0
"I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came on A&E some years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actresses. This has got to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. The storyline of this TV version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! The ""kicker"" (pun intended) comes when Ruth has surgery done on her leg bones."|1
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to see. When we were kids, we used to go for rides on a submarine, and as kids we always wanted to go on one when we could, but we never had the chance. When I was a child, I didn’t even know if there was anything like a submarine until I started taking classes at university and discovered there was. You can’t really see the ocean on land, but you can imagine how amazing the deep blue ocean looks.|0
But I ca n't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung . Where to begin . . . On a daily basis I get messages and emails from people who either don't know that I'm here, or who don't believe what I say. They have a vested interest in seeing me disappear and in this they are right. But it's not like they can get to me. I'm protected and I'll be out of their reach soon enough. The first thing I have to say about the dung, is to say that you don't deserve it!|0
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The ill-fated Payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the African jungle where she lives on husband Cavanaugh's plantation: doctor Conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman Burr's approach is, quite literally, more hands-on.|1
Maybe it 's just that it was made in 1997 , or maybe whoever managed to get this up to the public service air waves is just as bad as the media. Either way, you can't expect much from it. I wonder how long before the average Joe and Jane get sick of this? How about getting sick of watching it, or hearing about it every day for months and months? Oh, one other thing. If the average person doesn't get sick of the TV show, then how does it continue to be produced and broadcast every night for nine years.|0
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it."|1
"Okay,I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this!I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD!!!! !This film is so darn bad!I never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but I did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!"|1
His music , especially what we hear of it here , is very slow . From around the time of his birth until his death in 1882 , he composed only twelve songs . This makes sense when we realize he never played an instrument , had no money to buy instruments , and didn't have much of an education. In the years after 1855 , the family was forced to relocate to Philadelphia . It wasn't until he was in his mid forties that they moved again , this time to Newport, Rhode Island, where he was able to study with a teacher who was an expert in the guitar .|0
i was a huge fan of this series. Yesterday i watched it again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} & Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. This series shows what good, clean comedy is.If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10.|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ? ).This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr K's era. It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors.This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war.|1
The worst movie I have ever seen . The sound quality was bad , the cutting of the scenes was not sharp , there was no editing , no continuity . The acting was bad . There is no point in going to see this , you will not be satisfied . . . it is the worst movie I have ever seen . An absolutely atrocious adaptation of a novel with an awful script, and a poor story to boot. If you are not interested in the story then you will not like this film, if you like the story then it is well worth seeing.|0
This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world . The social criticism of our shallow , superficial media has produced a public which is increasingly un-moved by truth. I wrote the following on the internet under my real name as part of the Guardian's attempt to get me sacked. I'm now going to repost it on this blog under my real name. It's the last thing I'll ever do. I know what I know. I have known about the war on terror since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.|0
Forget any angst-ridden documentary ! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose sex life with a young student turns out to be much more exciting than he expected. But the movie has more than that, and its heart is firmly rooted in reality. Nanak Shah is the only woman in this film, but it doesn't matter. This is definitely not a love story, but rather a comedy with a happy ending. There's hardly any nudity, sex or swearing in the film, but you do have to be ready for them.|0
What can I say...not much to this one at all. Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are just OK. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No one else rose above mediocre.The story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere.|1
"RIFIFI ( Jules Dassin - France 1955 ) To me , it seems a very risky idea to attempt a film about a man who can only think of sex from a moral standpoint. That said , I will take you on a journey that will make you ask , ""What is sex? "". And I will ask the same question: What is the meaning of love? How are we to live , and how will we die ? How will we define beauty ? When did we come to love ? And what will be our final conclusion ?"|0
Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is , perhaps , not understandable for the `` rest of the world ' ', because of the language barrier , which was not considered a handicap in Germany , but is still a challenge in the English-speaking world . There is a reason why many of the scenes in the film are filmed in German , because this is where the film was mostly shot . However , the English translation is done by German-speaking, American film-critics, and this does not make for an easy read . One reason why Krajobraz has been so successful in its native country is , perhaps , the language barrier .|0
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film . We 're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project with the best of them as we discuss this film , this film and more film . So if you like movies with blood splattered all over the walls and floor then you'll probably dig this thing . You know the drill - a bunch of film nerds (and film critics) are sitting around watching a movie and they come up with a number of reasons why the film is awesome . That's what this week is about .|0
Wealthy businessman 's daughter , who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath , died on the day she was scheduled to go to the hospital after having surgery on her hip. A day before her death, she was to be released from the hospital. She was suffering from a bacterial infection after an unsuccessful attempt to remove her hip pain by surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic. Now her family is asking for her name to be removed from any cemeteries, including the one at Forest Lawn, her home.|0
It may be hard to explain how , but this film is a masterpiece . Perhaps , because i never knew about the film before watching , i had forgotten how it was . And the same thing is true of the film . In the movie , you will watch a film that you would not have seen before . But , you do not have the time , to watch it . In fact, you have to hurry up . That is because , the film is a very intense one . It is very important that you watch it , and it is also important to remember the film .|0
I'd liked the Takashi Miike films I'd seen so far, but I found this pretty disappointing. I'd bought it, but I won't be keeping it.I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has just two episodes. In the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by TV static.|1
"The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French ""Emmanuelle 2."" This amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan/Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character, Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality."|1
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster 's . I saw this film when I had no internet access. I didn't expect to take in this movie just like that. I saw the film when it came out on BluRay but I didn't think that I would really go to that much of a stretch and watch this movie on my own. I am very pleased with this movie. The first thing that I have to say was that this movie is absolutely brilliant . I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie.|0
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess.Once again, my search for sleazy, European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling with crap camera-work, and abundant with awful acting (Franco regular Lina Romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing, elderly woman).|1
I wo n't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season , but then , things just kept going down hill from there. The writing and the actors just didn't work as well in season two and it's a shame that the creators and the producers didn't know better . The first episode was great and in my opinion better than the first season, but the second was just not up to par . It felt a bit rushed and like the creators were trying to fill up the story .|0
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. You won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it.|1
I watched this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student , nor am I a cinema lover, but I think it is not just a movie , this is an education about a person and his or her life and the society around them . If you are of a family, you would love to learn from it , if you are not , then leave it . I had seen it twice now and I have one comment . The first time I watched it I was really excited because of the trailer .|0
Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc.|1
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie . The first shot is of a young couple that looks like they were in a music video. Then we go to a high school class that is going to a music recital . And we get into one of those situations where everybody is too busy to notice the warning signs . I’ll just leave it at that. This was one of those movies where it seemed like the entire cast knew exactly what they wanted to be doing, even though they had never acted in a film before .|0
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen . On a par with Blair Witch or The Sixth Sense . In fact this should be a warning for those who are planning on seeing the movie or want to be in a group of people who see the movie. The story starts off with a murder , which is followed by the narrator explaining to the reader what just happened. It was a murder committed by a man or a group of men and it was a very gruesome and brutal thing.|0
There is only one word to define the whole movie , that is : awful . How `` Mostly Martha Jane '' came to be, is what I will be doing here . I guess it is a movie , I guess it should have been a book or a short story. I suppose that is the only way I can put it . I am glad I watched it . If you are a movie lover, you must see it . As for those who think they have seen it all . I think I can say that you have had your share and that you have had enough .|0
"Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? There is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that I found this ""movie"" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and POORLY ACTED. I admire them for the try, but the ""actors"" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I did not have that option, so it gets a 1."|1
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan , I have to say that this film while not awful , just did not really move me very much and it was just not that good a movie. The only thing I did really like was the opening and closing of it. The music was good, the story was ok, the dialogues were great but nothing really made it for me. The only part of it that could have used some work is probably the love scene between the main character and his girlfriend but it was not bad at all.|0
This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development.|1
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on . This movie is practically McHale 's masterpiece, but it doesn't stand up on its own merits. At the very beginning of its existence I was a bit disappointed in it. I wasn't expecting the story to be quite that great. What made this movie work for me was a few great performances, and the ending. If this movie was a bit more polished, I think the movie would have been even more satisfying. If you are a fan of cult classics, this is definitely a film you should check out.|0
"I could n't stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime . Comparisons to Hitchcock are a little too obvious , even if Hitchcock did make the most of a very different kind of psychological thriller "" The Man Who Knew Too Much ."" It's just a really good movie , with some truly wonderful performances from the two main stars . There's really nothing else like it . I haven't seen much of the other movies made from the book , but that doesn't mean I haven't read the books or seen the movies , or even the books in which the movie was based ."|0
Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn't the worst I've ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I've mentioned.Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.Does this make sense...no?|1
I ca n't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb . Of course , it doesn't do justice to what the movie is as far as its content is concerned . This is the second installment of the movie series . The first installment is the one that we all remember from the 80's . Now , I don't mind watching a decent action movie that has a fair number of fight scenes , and there is an average number of scenes which are of great quality , but I am surprised with the rating of the movie which is 3.6 .|0
I am so excited that Greek is back ! This season looks really eventful . Im glad that Casey is in this season so i can watch him on TV . The last episode of the first season was really good , im really looking forward to the second season . Lets hope its really great . I am really exited about this season and i would love to see it . Im glad they are going for a third season . The writers have to be really creative and i wish they would bring something new to this season . I hope they are able to continue with this story .|0
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.Now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.That and no more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood.This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show.|1
Ty Cobb is , by far , the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live . His baseball career lasted for over a decade . In that time , he played in 1,500 games and won over 100 of them . He won the triple crown , a .300 batting average and 100 RBI titles . He won the MVP award . He set records for wins and strikeouts. He set record after record in strikeout . He played his entire career at the age of 22 . And , he's only played baseball since he was 4 .|0
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds the ""box"". As soon as Cole finds it he says, ""The box. Everyone's got a box"". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, ""We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often"".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert! )I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out."|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado , played to perfection with expert timing and panache , you're going to have to pay a good price. You will, no doubt, have no problem finding the perfect place to perform Mikado — for free, for a small fee, or for nothing. The only problem is that you don't know what you're getting into. You have to know that you've got an audience before you go out there and try to make them feel something, and you have to get them into a state of euphoria.|0
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb , so even I sensed something rotten in it 's synopsis I decided to read it anyway. There is a scene in the beginning where the wife is shown a photo of a dead man and asks why he died. The police officer replies that the dead man is the husband of her friend and that the man is a suspected drug dealer. After the wife leaves, the policeman goes to another room in the house. The wife is still there. He says to her that this is what the police have found.|0
"Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak). The ""cold-turkey"" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from Saul Bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein."|1
"River 's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual incident, and takes place during World War II.A group of young men are sent on a long journey to escape Nazi occupation. Their goal: to reach a small town on the border of Nazi occupied France and Spain where their families can be reunited. The Film

Lets start with the Good, the Bad & the Ugly! This film is an extreme tale of fear. It was released in 1944, and portrays a young man, who had to flee from Nazi occupied France."|0
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Winslet’s career at the most popular restaurant in London—if you’re a fan of Kate, if you like watching people do stupid things, if you’ve seen The World’s Fastest Indian or if you’ve seen The Devil Wears Prada. So, you’re watching it. You love this movie. You love it a lot more than you should. And this is the point at which it’s best to say that you hate it.|0
My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF ( a film festival). The first thing I thought was that it’s just not that good and then my wife said I was wrong. Then we watched it again because I wasn’t sure if we’d gotten it or not. It’s a fun movie. The plot of the film is based off of the idea of “ancient astronauts” or “chariot builders” as seen in the movie Forbidden Planet.|0
You ca n't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money . Most people will tell you, that if you want something to be real , you've gotta make it seem real . This is true in every industry , even the movie industry . One thing Hollywood does not shy away from is to make a movie that glorifies a person . It is almost always the result of making money first and foremost . It may seem hard to believe , but people in Hollywood do not take their jobs seriously at all , except when they are on a big movie .|0
"I rented this one by accident. I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ""shameless Blair Witch rip-off"". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. Boring Characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the Blair Witch Project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits."|1
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the trailer. What I don't understand is the fact that the trailer shows the movie in full color, with a black screen. Why didn't the producers just show it in black and white like they do with the book? What's the point in going over the same ground that's been done before? It just feels a bit repetitive. I have seen it. I thought that it was okay. I didn't know what to expect.|0
The only pure life , is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway , a young man with a dream to go from being a commoner to being a man of importance in his own country. He does what is necessary to achieve this goal. But there is one problem – there is nothing that you can do to take your place among the great. That is why he makes his way to America , a country he knows to be the land where he can achieve his dream. He gets himself a job as a teacher and starts teaching the children.|0
"The inspiration for the `` Naked Gun '' movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy roles - as a man on the run in New York City, forced to carry a gun because he is wanted for murder. He must use his skills as the best undercover cop in America to solve the case of his life and avoid the law.

'' That's when the idea of a '' Naked Gun '' movie took shape. It seemed a good idea, and the film was in the works for a few years, but it languished."|0
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit . How darethey ? It 's not even 10 years since we got our hands on this film ! What was the matter with them ? Turks Fruit was a box-office hit, and this one will not even be half a year in the theaters! They should have thought about that before. I am not sure I will watch a film that has been made and not been even released! I will go and watch Turks Fruit on DVD, but that 's it! As far as I could tell, this film was pretty good for the time period.|0
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 ( Dir-Brett Thompson ) : Silly , juvenile-focused movie about three kids on a cruise ship that goes missing for 6 months while on the high seas. There was not a whole lot of character development, which I think is a good thing because I don't know who these kids were or why they were on this cruise ship. There was a great scene where the three kids were on a movie that had no actors, so I thought I would give them a chance. I watched it with my mom.|0
"Without saying how it ended , it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes and thirty seconds into something which we can't even begin to imagine . . . I think you can see what a lot of people will think when this thing comes along . . . "" (Savage, 1985)

### **""What Is This Mess""**

The ""mess"" is ""what we're talking about"" when we ask ""What is the purpose of this mess"" ? It is not just what we can see."|0
"Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references . Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing . Noah Baumbach is at his best here, he's always better when he plays like an actual human being instead of a caricature. You have to watch this movie, it's worth the price. I recommend everyone to see this film, whether it's your first one, your 50th or you're trying to impress your girlfriend. This review contains spoilers, click expand for those. ""It doesn't matter, as long as you're there."""|0
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me . The test that postal workers are given on the first day of each month for a position as a postal clerk is whether or not one can read a U.S. postal letter and then write a check or deposit one into the U.S. bank account. If you can't, the post office will give you one year to make the switch, and if you can't or won't, they will put you in a training program for a different job.|0
So keira knightly is in it...So automatically we compare this film to attonement. Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.The Actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.If you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.This film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath.|1
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an over used story but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days.|1
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity.|1
This movie has an outstanding acting , by Marilia Pêra , and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco , who directed it. This movie , in it s first act , is a classic story of the human condition , about a young man called Cesar Varela , an alcoholic who goes to work for a family friend in an estate in the south of Argentine, and tries to find out if he can be the man he wants to be . When Cesar returns home from this job the next day he finds out that his wife, who had left him, is now with another man .|0
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one.|1
Not the best plot in the world , but the comedy in this movie rules . Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this film and I hope he makes more films like this one . It's not perfect but you can watch it for free and it will take you some time to understand the movie . I can't say that the plot is so funny , I think that it's not that good , so if you don't like the movie that's not the point , because the humor is there , and it's just a few moments that makes you think , and you have to see it .|0
"Like a lot of people, I loved the original; ""American Graffiti"" was one of the great movies of the 70s. The sequel, ""More American Graffiti"" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. It wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as ""Laurie's"" character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and ""Terry the Toad"" and ""Pharaoh Joe"" somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam)."|1
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this ? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece of fluff by director Steven Spielberg. It’s silly in the extreme, which may, or may not be a good thing for this movie. The whole idea of this film is ridiculous, that’s what the film is really about. This is why this movie is so good. The plot is silly because the premise of the story is absurd. The characters are absurd. This is exactly what a good film is: A good film makes you believe something ridiculous.|0
This movie is an example of small budget , ineffective star cast , weak storyline and poor entertainment . This movie does not have any story . It is a waste of time . You will have to endure a lot of un-enjoyable situations . The movie is not even entertaining . The storyline is not good and the plot does not make sense . In the end it is just a waste of your time . It does not deserve your money or your attention . The characters do not act in a good manner . They are really annoying . They are so dumb they are unable to recognize their mistakes .|0
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. The script left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara like rip-off of some Saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. Nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. I'm just amazed I found this at a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old VHS movies.|1
I like Arnold, and I love the subject matter, but this was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I admit, most of his are pretty good!). He had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited.|1
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.|1
Wow ! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for those of you who are insomnia-addled people. I don't know what is wrong with me but I have no problem sleeping at 10PM. And when I am trying to doze off while watching TV, it's a whole different ball game. Especially when I am trying to watch a movie in HD. It's hard for me to fall asleep when I am watching HD TV. I guess what's really bothering me are those commercials.|0
"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see""."|1
My Take : Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller , even a good one. How is he going to be a lead in anything without a good acting ability or an interesting character ? First, this film was supposed to be made with him in mind. He is supposed to play a tough detective who is not afraid of getting dirty and is good with the ladies. He would have been an interesting lead to me, as he is a good actor and I have a great interest in action movies.|0
Leonard can write lyrics , but he sure ca n't sing . Nor has he had an original idea in his entire professional acting career - not one. In my opinion, he only does what he is forced to do by the nature of his contract, not by his own talent and creativity, but the nature of his contract and the fact that he has been offered a contract by the most powerful entertainment group in Hollywood. If Leonard has any talents at all, I would say it's the ability to say one thing in one breath, and then in the next breath, make another thing up entirely.|0
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake , ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake , but i think it would be good to try it , because at least it would be like new and make up the lost time . So here are my suggestions , hope they are acceptable to people who have watched the original and liked it . First thing, i hope to remade it the way it was in the beginning : the story would be continued in a way that in the end it could not be done in the original film , because the ending of the original film left something to be seen .|0
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I found myself very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all let me preface my review with the fact that I love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era.|1
Wow -- this movie was really bad ! You talk about formulaic , typical movie plot ? Watching this movie was really bad, but there's some good stuff in it. I can't tell if that's the director's doing or the actor's. It was just awful and I thought the film was mediocre. I know I should not have rated this film so low. It was a step up, but there was nothing special about it. I'm surprised that this review has gotten all the way through but I didn't think there was a chance for it to get to the top.|0
"Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware ""cop-movie parody"", and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not!"|1
Yep, it's me again! Mr 'I sit through crap so you don't have to'.What do you think this is about? Could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant DA to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to?|1
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appear in black and white.|1
Okay , anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film . A sophisticated film by a great director , not a masterpiece in any sense , a movie I would rather watch with my family and friends , in contrast with all the other movies with a great story or a great performance . A film where there is no tension , where there is no surprise , a movie which has all the elements I wanted from a film . A movie in which the music has the same tempo in every second .|0
"It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I have seen the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fits very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character being a gun toting, badge wearing, pair of butt cheeks, shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or ""guilty"". So far, the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, play's the sobering retort to assy's A.A. antics and random ""I've got a hunch"" leads."|1
"I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one more season. But when the end came closer I was exited to see that. And what did we get? This episode called ""NOT FADE AWAY"" was the very last one.I was so disappointed by this episode. This is absolutely the worst way to this series. Why couldn't it get a happy ending? Why did have a few of the main characters to die? Why did Angel not become a human and was reunited with Buffy again? No."|1
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised . As in “I’d rather die than go to the movies, it’ll never happen!” Never. Ever. I refuse to have to go see this version of a tale which has been told more than a few times now in movies and books. This version takes the story of Pimpernel from the book by Henry Fielding with some of Fielding’s changes and changes the ending of the tale to a far more dark and sad end for Pimpernel.|0
One of my desires is to be a film-maker, and I just have to say there's no way I will be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watching it, I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed.Estevez's and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing.And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2.|1
"I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, ""Destined to be the next stoner classic"", hardly.Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on."|1
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made . Huevos de oro seems to be one of those films which was made specifically for a younger audience and it’s actually quite fun to watch . I wouldn’t have expected to see this in Mexico , but now I see why it made its way to our market . The plot is really simple and there isn’t anything really complicated . It also doesn’t have the emotional impact that I’d expect to get from a film like this .|0
Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. Plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed.|1
"There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the ""most obvious"" woman she's ever met."|1
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts . You must watch it for its strong characterisation , humour , humour , humour , humour , humour , and for one of the best songs in a movie today. I can't think of another movie with so many memorable scenes. It was the 1980's and the US had just invaded Grenada. Soap had just spent a year working in Haiti. And as the film progresses you notice that she has not lost a thing. She has not forgotten that place, and there are many moments when you wonder if she has.|0
"What a mess--and I'm not referring to the ""destruction"" in the title. I could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there weren't any palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it at that.Hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on IMDb.. OK, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing."|1
One of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope.|1
This can hardly be called a good movie , actually it 's not even close . But I have to say it is the kind of film that you will like , or hate , or whatever you want to call them , when you don't really know or have a good idea what kind of a movie it is or what you like or don't like in it . It is a comedy , so I will try to give a brief description of it , maybe some of it will come across funny to you .|0
I generally LIKE Sion Sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. But sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. The plot makes only a whisper of sense. I think it was intended to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But the humor, such as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gory. I would say perhaps Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well.|1
This film is so 1980's and that is what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. Reagan in the White House telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. Young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead.|1
* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films , this is definitely one of the funniest. It is definitely one of the best, and one of the best baseball films ever. As you may have noticed there is not a baseball game in this film. This is due to two factors. The first is that they are filming it on a set, and the set has a baseball diamond attached to it. This means that I will probably have to get up before dawn to see the film, instead of having it in a theater in the late evening.|0
I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed dull to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor.|1
There is a point in the film where the female boss of the `` death machines '' ( a multi-ethnic prison where the inmates are forced to work in conditions that resemble slave-labor ) is having some trouble with her new staff. She says to the female guard who has come in the room: `` I need you to know that I have a lot of respect for my men, because I really do. However, there are certain men I don't know personally, and those I don't know at all, and I have some problems with those I don't know at all.''|0
"This movie was lacking in a lot of areas. It's about this Elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. THey want the Elvis guy to be their ""driver"". At times, I wanted the folks from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. Sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as ""What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE"". That was cheesy."|1
San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother?|1
I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back . It was so bad , I can only say that I found it funny (I was 8 years of age at the time I watched it) . My brother and I would have a good time at my parents . I remember him showing my mom some of my video tapes which I had taken , he showed her how to slow my tapes down so she could understand . I have no idea if he showed her how to slow the speed down to match my brother .|0
"This film is a nightmare! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished watching this movie: ""UffOK, it ended, what a relief!"" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a B-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it not an excuse to be so bad! I've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! This one got nothing of it!"|1
"I think ""category 6: day of destruction"" was very unrealistic. The digital effects where like a children's cartoon. The actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny!Please keep the special effects real.I liked the comment: ""What did we do to p.i.s.s-off Mother Nature? ""I don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines."|1
"I caught this movie late night on TV, and was expecting a low-budget campy ""masterpiece"", I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.There is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a ""big brother""-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix."|1
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.OK what about the plot outline?|1
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie. Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I have seen worse acting. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and was really a interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably wont enjoy this, but if you are you'll like this movie.The main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites.|1
It 's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a real job, that a man can have a 'job', and make a living by doing something that they actually don't love doing at all to the point that they actually hate what they're doing. What I have found is that while you do need to learn about the law and how it works in this country to be considered a lawyer, the real skills that a lawyer should have is the ability to think, to communicate, and to think like a client would think.|0
I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. However, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet *real* for me. Before I saw this version, Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English. Having seen Jacobi's Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording.|1
It's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.The movie is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park.|1
"One would have expected Hitchcock 's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution . however, the master of suspense remains the same, he just does a far better job of hiding it. . to be sure, there have been moments in his filmography that have earned the title of ""bad movie,"" but in terms of his entire output, you could argue that his first three feature films are the best of the lot . and that's saying something. . i'm not going to say that any of those movies is a classic, but neither are they all terrible ."|0
Duncan Roy 's writing and direction is really , and regularly , below par . Actually it sort of stinks that he isn't given the respect he deserves , and that it's been allowed to get to the point where people are actually starting to criticize him on here for it . So, if you love the hell out of Duncan 's music , or if you 'd like to try and convince Duncan that we 'd be a better couple if he took better care and more time to write and direct, this is a petition for you , Duncan .|0
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending ( or maybe a Crying Game ending? I dunno). I think it is one of the most original and entertaining movies I have seen. I highly recommend watching this movie if you have seen it before. If not then you have a new movie in your hands and you need to do what any self respecting film lover will do…watch the movie. This movie is amazing, funny, and moving. I hope you will watch it for yourself and enjoy yourself.|0
"I do n't understand why this movie was released , it looked like something that you show your mates after a few drinks at the pub when you are too tired for the cinema , it should be called ""I do too much"" . I have to say i think it looks like something you should see in the theatre at 1 am after a night of hard partying, just so you have something to justify your drunken behaviour. I am one of those people who has seen it twice already and I have to say I think this is the most disappointing movie ever made."|0
"In fact it was awful. The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. It was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. Sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? No they aren't. At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a ""creative writing"" course. Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure."|1
This self-important , confusing b+w `` film '' watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip . You can tell it's B+W by the way it plays with the camera and the lighting . It seems intent on trying to tell us who is talking and who is the speaker , when in truth it doesn't have the cojones to make that claim . But what it does do is to give us all the answers you could possibly want to ask it. It does that by turning the camera and the lighting on .|0
I 'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie . Do n't get me wrong , it is a very good movie , it has some very interesting parts in it and some of the performances are very good. I have to admit , I have watched it once or twice before . And that was the first time I have watched it on dvds . But I have always liked it . This time around , I am enjoying it more . I just love the concept , and how it came about , so I will try my best to see it again , this time .|0
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! The plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. More unrecoverable life time wasted!If you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once.|1
"What ever happened to shows with united parental figures? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they're ""cute."" This show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the ""divide and conquer"" technique is the best way to get their parents to ""cave."""|1
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When its over you say to you self ""huh? that's it?!?"". This is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?Its too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute."|1
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy.|1
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands , but given Uwe Boll 's track record it would not have been good. I have a few thoughts. - If they could have just had him do the show, I think I'd be OK with it. - In hindsight I'm not sure that they really had the resources to get this out and in the air in a short period of time. The idea of this being a tv movie with a limited budget seems like a bad thing to me. And I think it would have made the show seem like a tv movie more.|0
Young , ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee ( Rosie Holotik ) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the country. She meets and falls in love with a doctor, played by the excellent David Strathairn , and he leaves her. Ms. Charlotee has her own apartment, so it’s only logical that she takes up residence in David’s house. But the place has a creepy history, and it turns out that she is just the latest victim. There is a great scene early on when Ms. Charlotee tells her daughter about the doctor.|0
I remember the events of this movie , the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 , in the days of my first sexual experience . A cruise that would end in tragedy . The movie ” Cruising ” was filmed in the year 1972 , in the same place where the movie was also shot , in Santa Barbara , California . The movie “Cruising ” was directed by , , and it was adapted into the musical ” Cruising .” The movie ” Cruising ” was inspired by the events , in the same place at the same time of , in , in the year 1968 .|0
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome.|1
"I don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...Fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies I've ever seen. Not sure what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with ""Scream""?"|1
Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers ' ( 1968 ) said `` Do n't talk about it '', because then they know it's real. That's what the movie spoof is all about '' ( See ' Do n't speak of it ' ). And the more we can make the movies of our imaginations, the less that will be made of us by others. So let's spoof our film-going habits. In doing this, we will also find that spoofs have become part of our culture rather than part of it.|0
Okay , When I bought this flick I though this got ta be the ultimate b-movie , space monkey landing in the middle of a battle with alien robots . But I was wrong , it was great , I guess i need to see the whole flick to understand but I thought it was a little bit more over-the-top in parts . So , I'm sitting here on a rainy day in the basement of my local comic store and I get this idea and I've been sitting on it for the last hour or so . The idea is this : Why can't I make a super hero movie ?|0
Why would I say that ? Because when the movie ended , I was in a good mood . So what if it ended with a bomb ? I didn´t care at all about that part of the film . I wanted to finish the movie , because it is still one of my favorites of all time, and when I saw the film , I liked it . So what is the problem ? The film is about a man who loses his wife in a terrorist act . The film is about loss, and the fact that there is no escape. We all know the feeling.|0
Its my favourite film because there 's so much going on that you do n't see at first and so many characters that you want to get to know them better. I've never been able to watch the film again after I saw it again. It is amazing how much you can get from the movie if you just let it do all of the talking. It’s hard to describe, but I would liken it to being in a beautiful place when you just start to feel your heart open up and let go of whatever it is that has been controlling you for so long.|0
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals . When they get there, however, they discover they’ve been duped by an animal lover who tells them that the lab is for scientific research, not animal experimentation. The island the group is on has no inhabitants other than animals they are brought in for experimentation and the scientist who runs it has a very particular way of doing it. He also doesn't like animals being around his lab, so he locks the island up and the animals on it inside.|0
i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up . ( got to watch my favorite show) I'm not saying I'm the same person I was at 18 or 21 years old but I still look back at the episodes and wonder about the stories told in the show and how things would've played out differently had I or someone similar to me been in that scenario. There were so many different scenarios, that I can't think of a single episode that I saw on that show that I didn't wonder how it would all turned out.|0
I did have some expectations from this film because 1 . It was a Yash raj production 2 . When I read the plot I thought this film will be a horror flick . But after seeing it I think it will be an interesting thriller film . I thought it would be a horror , but I was pleasantly surprised . This is a good film which is entertaining and you will enjoy it . The film has some good and bad acting in it . The film is full of fun and there is even some comedy in it which is really nice .|0
"I love these awful 80's summer camp movies. The best part about ""Party Camp"" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak batch of ""characters"" into a location and then things occasionally happen. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman."|1
"I don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but I'm glad I'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the ""Die Hard"" series, but seeing little Jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a Glock, as a NOVICE yet...c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a ripped T-shirt and she would BE Bruce Willis. Apparently, Jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be."|1
In Everything Is Illuminated , Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer , a Jewish American who is looking for the woman he believes was his love interest in his past. As Foer travels back to his past through time, a string of coincidences bring Foer into direct contact with his former lover , a woman who has the power to alter time and space to change what happened between them. With Foer and the woman trying to understand how time and space might have changed them, the film is a quest to discover how to understand our relationship to the past and the past of a relationship.|0
A CBS radio program entitled `` We the People '' assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles R. Schumacher, who fled Austria after being sentenced to four years in a labor camp for refusing to sign a pledge refusing to make war on Germany. A CBS radio program entitled ``We The People'' finds a home for a Vienna refugee fleeing Nazi persecution. Austria 's last hope for Charles Schumacher, a refugee with the courage to refuse to accept a life sentence in a Nazi labor camp, died Monday at his home in Texas.|0
I was n't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face . Julie Walters , in her first big role , is so terrible that I had no intention of watching the movie . The movie suffers for lack of focus . The story line goes on for a long time and Julie Walters has one line that says everything that needs to be said . She plays it so well and I have seen so many great actors in great movies , but I could not see Julie Walters in my dreams . The other thing is the script .|0
Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I'm spending time watching the thing. I watched the emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world was the Empire Falls (excellent name)TV movie up for any awards? It truly had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend that was an OK (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? OK direction?|1
I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed. The special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. A typical unimaginative slasher flick.It's hard to believe, make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots.|1
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead, in its place, is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the Rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters.|1
"MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson 's finest and most personal films . It may seem funny to call the film ""unfinished"", but in the hands of the right writer/director/star it could well become a masterpiece . But even at this early stage in the process , it's worth remembering that this film was never meant to see the light of day . It was Henson's masterwork , it's just that no-one saw it. So how do we know what to believe? It would seem the truth lies in what we do NOT believe , rather than what we do believe ."|0
This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies.|1
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and poorly executed, but there are some hilarious jokes and moments. It's a movie that I would watch if it were in a theater, just so I can laugh. It's not that funny, though, and isn't really a spoof, it doesn't even attempt to be a parody but it is an attempt. There are a few good moments and some funny jokes throughout but it's a pretty poor effort.|0
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes . I feel comfortable writing it now , because I’ve never written my blog with less time to go . I can say that this experience with the film is the most interesting and interesting to me . I have not read many of the films that have been adapted in this way and I don’t believe that I have ever seen a movie in this way . There is a story that comes from the book and it is not the only story but the main story .|0
"This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80 's entertainment . Oh do n't get me wrong. I am not saying it's ""great"" per se, it's merely great in the way you just described, but it's certainly very entertaining. And that's just what I love to see in a good 80's film. And this is a classic. I'm surprised how many people remember it as a ""classic"". I didn't. This movie was great! I just remembered how much of a fan of ""The Thing"" I was in '86!"|0
I don't understand why this movie was released, it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if an Aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad... boy was I wrong!If anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film.The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, it was the WORST acting in the HISTORY OF FILM.|1
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom TV dramas I've seen (Law and Order, etc) for a courtroom drama which doesn't try to be too realistic. I think you could get away with more realism but it doesn't work if you try for too much. This is a very well done, thought out and very well cast show. It's been a long time since I saw an HBO courtroom series but this has been a long time coming.|0
Filmmaker Bryan Forbes , who once displayed a light , sardonic touch with beguiling material such as `` Whistle Down the Wind ' '' and `` High Noon '' , once again demonstrates his characteristic wit and humor in '' I, Too'' ( Dir. George Roy) , a charming, funny comedy which has all the makings of one of the year's best. There is something to be said for the fact that few of the most memorable movies of this year are even remotely based on plays. Nor are the films any more or less worthy than they are to be classified in this way.|0
I too saw this film at a film festival , but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and entertaining. In fact it's one of the most interesting films this year , and probably the most entertaining film I've seen from 2012 . The film itself is based on a true story , which is actually a little hard to swallow as it makes it sound as if this film was set in the past and was just a re-telling of the past. However, it is actually a fictionalized version , and the film is set in a place that was once a bustling metropolis in a past century.|0
"Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it this past weekend, and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better...it didn't...The picture quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting itself was cheesy, but I guess it's acceptable for ""yet another"" teenage horror flick."|1
Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie , which took me three sessions over three days to finally watch with my young son. I had been hoping to convince myself to give the movie a go on the big screen rather than streaming, but I’ve decided it’ll just be better if the kids can’t see me in it. Now, if I had been able to see the movie in its entirety, maybe it would be easier for me to write about. But the fact is, the movie’s been sitting on my Netflix queue since early August.|0
Bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her?|1
There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims.|1
"The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of ""The War At Home,"" I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night, while flipping through channels, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it."|1
The acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. The writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this???|1
Strange , often effective hippie zombie flick , starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby , this film is one that I've been meaning to see since I saw it as a child and even then I thought it was funny. I saw it twice , the first time when I was a kid in the back of my Uncle's Buick , the second time was at a movie festival a few years ago and had never forgotten how much I liked it . As a child I was enthralled watching this film , it wasn't just because of its comic value .|0
This movie was lacking in a lot of areas . It 's about this Elvis type guy who races cars . I 'm not into this kind of music . The guy in the car , he's just a poor kid . This is his story . I just feel sorry for him . The director of this movie did not care for his cast , and that's the problem with this movie . The main stars are all terrible . The only one who did a good job was Tim Allen . The problem with him is that he's so good that it makes the entire film seem like bad .|0
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings , but that is n't saying much.The plot is pretty good , but the ending is stupid and confusing . I have no idea what happened, except the guy in a suit who had a knife to my character's throat as he was trying to rape her. He is somehow the only person I saw die. I don't think the ending is bad though. There is a lot that happens that's good and that we don't get to see and it all adds to the film.|0
First of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.But, I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion.|1
I 'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask . I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film lover but have only just recently become interested in anime. I know there are quite a few anime I 've not seen but there are also ones I've seen that I 'm not so much into. So I have a few questions about it and I 'm curious if I could get some feedback on what anime do you prefer ? Thanks in advance :) . 1 . What do you prefer about the anime you've seen.2. Any anime you would like to recommend.3.|0
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and it was a lot of fun. As far as this film is concerned I was pleasantly surprised and was impressed with what I had been led to expect and was a bit let down I had a few minor complaints with it. Overall I was happy with it but had a few gripes to pick out with the story and a few other things. I am glad I did see the film but there are better movies out there that I could’ve watched.|0
Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it, as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. There was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it.|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie ( you do n't have to throw cartloads of money at it!) but i don't think its as bad as it could have been. If this is the best version of the movie, then theres alot to be thankful for. If not then theres plenty to criticize and nitpick about this film. I'll give it a 5/10, because the script, scriptwriting, and the way it's shot just doesn't have the same quality in this version. If you watch the original, there are alot more plot holes.|0
"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep."|1
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness, so don't worry about this unless you're in that kind of environment. If the gangster is a hit man or an assassin in the mob, don't expect too much help. The mob will kill him first. The best advice I can give is be careful. A lot of gangsters will tell you to run, because they are so good at hiding their tracks. Some of them are so smart that they don't know it.|0
I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it.|1
"Ah , another movie with motorcycles , hell 's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver . and i like it , though i can't figure out why anyone would want to go to the movies anyway . this is the story of "" the love 's journey "" which i thought was very good , until it turns into a car chase . and now here we are , in the world of motorcycles , with no story whatsoever . i guess it's time to pull out my copy of "" the book of motorcycles "" and see if we have anything new in common ."|0
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder. Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime.Sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late.|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen . It just was n't funny . My wife and I were watching it at a midnight showing and we both thought this would be a great movie to do with kids . And it is great ! The only problem was the sound quality . The film was just too loud . Very loud . I would never do it again . I would never go back there again . I was not impressed . I would not recommend this movie to any of my friends or family members . Not for a first time movie .|0
"The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work here. But this movie has great use of color and lighting, which I loved. “This movie is just so cool,” said one young man, “I don’t think there’s a lot of cool movies like this, where the actors are so into their roles, and there’s not a wasted moment of the movie.” He said, “This movie is just such an emotional ride.”

I liked the story."|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match ( Mahler 's 5th is gorgeous , but listen to Brahms' 6th ) and you get the best idea of why it's become such a cultural highlight. And as you wander from one performance to another , you'll pick up all kinds of little bits and pieces. Like this:

A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to have been invited to the launch of a new documentary film . It is called , ‘My Life’, and is by one of the most talented people in the world of documentaries."|0
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich, and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly prejudiced against the 'goy' characters -- content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures -- and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with.Feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine, and start dealing honestly with issues.|1
I would just like to point out ( in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD) that this is the first official release from the series I have been following and admiring since it began. So, I would like to support it. Just curious, does anyone know if any of you have any interest in watching it on Blu Ray? I have heard of it being released but haven't found anything about it. It would probably be pretty pricey but I'd be willing to pay it if there was a release option.|0
This movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I am talking about. That kid's vicous! Although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity.|1
I watched this movie with my mother . She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot .She watched this film when I was 10 . She said it was the first thing she’d never see .She is a retired school teacher from the early 70’s .I think we both have learned more about racism and bigotry than we know. The movie is about Martin Luther King, Jr. (the man) who led the Civil Rights Movement. The main character of the movie is Dr. King’s son. I believe that is Dr. Martin Luther Kings.|0
Well , I 've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it 's still almost as interesting as when i first watched it. I remember in the mid-70s, it seemed like there 'd been a change of some sort, I didn 't recognize the movie, or remember who was onscreen at that point, but i could tell it was a very good movie, very good in all the ways that matter, even if it took me 25 years to figure that out. I can remember the movie as something to look forward to.|0
"Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is ""manager"" Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him."|1
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities. It's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.The movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product.|1
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue, to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle!|1
I 'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video ' route. It's been around for ages, but I think its time for it to go away. It's cheap, and often not worth the cost of the movie or the effort required to watch it. But, that is not to say I have never bought and watched a movie that was released on video. It's the exception rather than the rule that is so important in my case. Back in 2007, I finally found myself with the DVD box set of 'The Hangover.'|0
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie , it would have some real depth or insight to offer. However, as it happens, it was pretty shallow for a movie that was released in 1997. It's not like anyone is going to re-watch it after a year. But, it does have the advantage of being an extremely entertaining film. While the film isn't one I'd normally pick up for its depth, it's worth watching just because it's entertaining.|0
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want.|1
The sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading role is not well developed , the main character does not have any distinctive features , the script is poor , I did not enjoy this movie , one of the worst in recent times , I give it three stars , not a great movie . In short , it is just an average movie . . . that is all it is, average . . . that’s all it was. . . . That’s the beauty of this blog.|0
"Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.Basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's ""Real Genius"", with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself."|1
This is simply a good ole fashioned western .. not overly complex or long . It does n't deceive itself into thinking it is anything else , and that is a good thing. I have to say that I enjoy reading this and found it to have some character to it. I would liken it to The Old West . Just a story with good characters and the ability to keep one's attention . A great story that you should enjoy. I was so excited about this book, and I was pleasantly surprised. The story is very well told and there are not many errors.|0
First off , the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I do n't understand how was allowed. When we were about halfway through the film and then it was going to take a dramatic turn it just took off at that moment and did not end until about 10 minutes into the film. The ending is very boring , boring , boring . The film is slow and boring , it has no emotion at all and has no plot at all. If you are not interested in this film just get ready to watch this movie with a boring ending.|0
For those that might send me nasty e-mails , shove it . There is a trend in Hollywood where those with more money want to see movies based on books . It started in the 40s and the 50s and it is now taking a backseat to movies based on books . And I think that is a mistake . I think it is wrong and a shame to make a movie about a book and then make an adaptation of the book . I think that is what has been going on . It has gone too far . I think that Hollywood has lost respect for our readers .|0
"Stephen Sondheim 's SWEENEY TODD : THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with a score by Jerry Herman and book and lyrics by Harold Prince. The musical opened on Broadway at the Waldorf Theatre as a limited engagement on 22 January 1980. Sondheim later said, ""I think there is a feeling that when the show opens, I will not be here."" The production then toured until it closed on 8 October 1980 as a regular Broadway production, with Sondheim as producer and opening night as the final night that he would be a performer."|0
Ok , everybody agreed on what was the best season . The first . And killing off Boone was a very good season for all . I liked it too . I saw the movie . But then the book comes out and I got to hear the story . But the movie is not so much . The movie was very boring . The story does not go well and it is very hard to understand the point . There was a lot of things happening that I never saw in the movie . But it is what it is . I do not know why some people like it .|0
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 , I dismissed it offhand , I mean, it’s a horror film . But in hindsight, I’m amazed that it ever made it to movie theaters . I had no problem at the time seeing it at the video store, but on the big screen? It was something else… something that would not play on film, but that might work on a VHS tape. So what made it tick? Well, there are a couple of factors.|0
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion! I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role!|1
"After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of ""Belphégor"" before."|1
"This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could take care of."" ""And, as you see, I did a very good job."" ""I'm not saying I'm better than any of the guys that did the picture or anything, but at the time, we were young, we were excited, we wanted to make a film and it all worked out for us."" ""The movie cost a million dollars and we were doing it on $20 a week."""|0
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget.|1
This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie . Remake a classic film shot-by-shot . I hope nobody ever does that . I agree . I've seen a lot of film rewrites but I've yet to see a film that doesn't have more holes in it then a bowling pin. I like the idea that it could be interesting, but it's far too boring and unoriginal for my taste. It's like taking a film that was originally shot in the 70s and making an hour long video with the same footage.|0
"Waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.And after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's ""rubbish bin for totally useless things"". One single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.CB is etremely campy, and intentionally so. The usual JW stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, overacting etc."|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best . She 's all wrapped in horror & suspense and as usual the plot twists & turns along with her. Traci has had quite a successful film career thus far as she is on the verge of becoming a leading lady in Hollywood. We see how this goes down in this movie and what happens in the aftermath of it . We are then treated to her best acting work as she is on the cusp of breaking into Hollywood. The movie is a bit of an erotic horror movie and that makes it even more interesting.|0
This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War -- most likely in anticipation of the 2020 Republican presidential election and its aftermath. But even now, with Democrats controlling both the executive and legislative branches, Trump’s policies are being carried out in full, and Republicans’ are not, with the help of a Democratic Party willing to do anything to obstruct Trump. If Trump is reelected in 2020, it will be a continuation, not a reversal, of the Obama administration’s policies, the same policies the president campaigned on and the party now claims as their own.|0
This is the Australian TV series. It is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and song just fantastic. The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that.|1
This is no walk in the park . I saw this when it came out , and have n't had time to post yet . I saw this in a video on youtube . A couple of months ago , a young black man was shot by an unknown gunman on a street . I can't find the video . The guy who did this was white , and had a gun that looked to be an automatic weapon . He shot the young man 5 times . The young man did not die . He was shot several times , and never moved . That was all I saw .|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film , so I ca n't really describe how great it was , but I thought I could give some more details , so I did . It's a very interesting movie in many ways , and one of those interesting ones is the relationship with the mother and the daughter . It is very important to see them , but also very difficult to watch the mother being in the same place as herself when she had her own daughter to take care of . She is forced to deal with it very well .|0
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know.|1
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is, then this would be it. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but rather this year alone, I haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far, be it from the West, or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great premise, but poor execution, relying on clichéd techniques (I think these are the only tools of the trade available?)|1
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic . Also it is directed by legendary horror filmmaker, Steven Spielberg , who has said that it was the film that made him into a master of horror . Here is the story . It revolves around a man named Bill and his best friend, John , who work on a secret government project. During one of their secret experiments they decide to put a young woman in the water and make her their pet . The woman is taken away by the government, and it is left to Bill and John to figure out where she is.|0
I am sick of series with young and clueless people , talking about their `` problems '' all the time. Why not give them a reality based show, like they do on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ? Let them get their life, work out and make a living and get their kids through college and take care of the rest of their lives. Just think if they had a reality based show where they had to take on a `` problem '' that was not their problem to solve? That's what would happen if we did not have cable, reality shows are a reality.|0
I ca n't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb . This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. I have seen it a few times but I have to say the writing is atrocious. The characters are bland and so predictable that you will not be able to predict what they are gonna do next. There was no tension and you will be bored to tears. The acting was horrible as well. I thought I would be entertained by watching a horror movie but this one was awful. It was like watching a horror movie with bad acting and writing.|0
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy.|1
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film. The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. It would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography.|1
I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort I managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on like this but I think you're getting the point......nothing happens ever in this movie.|1
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it . I comment here , however , because this is a good example of the problems that are faced during the film's development . From the very beginning the script is written as an allegory, as a story which could be read either by the audience, or for the audience by the characters themselves . This is a problem which occurs frequently in films of this era . But I think that it is also important to be honest about the film's weaknesses. In fact, I would have liked the film to have a different beginning.|0
This move is absolutely , most certainly one of the greatest films of its , or any other , genre to date . however , this is a film for all ages , and , more importantly , one of the all time classic films of all genres . of course , for some people , this may have been the only film they have ever watched . for many others , however , it has been their most favorite film since . this is also a film that one simply must see at least once in its , or , even its , entire run .|0
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they only dared to try a movie like this in the late 90s, but in fact, this is a film that can only exist in the ‘90s—a time when teens had the power to make a difference, or at least they could, if they wanted it enough. At the beginning of the film—the very first one you see—you’ve been asked by your friends not to wear any shoes or make eye contact with other people on the street.|0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. This can be pretty annoying.Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to Duchamp's ready mades. What's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Julio Iglesias.|1
`` Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable '' , the third in the series , is a magnificent piece of kit with a high level of finish. As well as being beautiful, this particular Scorpion is extremely durable thanks to its tough composite body that is reinforced around the wheels, handlebars, seat and handle. It is also extremely versatile thanks to the high quality aluminium bodywork which allows you to fit a variety of different handlebar systems and can be dismounted and carried in the front and back panniers. The front of the bodywork is made up of two parts.|0
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I didn't want to watch it, but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime.They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated more.Not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around.|1
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one . Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out, just as he would on a bad day in real life! But then, after the movie, people will just think he was acting in it, just as he was in real life. I know that's why I enjoy these reviews. You don't really know what people think of you until after you're dead. I haven't heard anything bad about the movie, I guess I just didn't bother looking at reviews.|0
Yeah , a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction . Now it 's a prison again . I don't think there are many people left in this place. I don't even know anyone in this area anymore . They all moved away with their families . When we were living here , we would visit it every now and then and take a walk down the road that we had passed through to get the old feel of where we were , but then we stopped coming here , cause we never had the money to do it .I remember it from when i first moved in here .|0
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine.|1
Unfortunately a boring flick , and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version on YouTube. The movie itself is a little better with it, but there's no doubt this version is going to be a lot of work for whoever wants to get a decent copy of it. That said, it is pretty entertaining. I got to see it recently at my local multiplex. It's a pretty bad film, so I'd probably give it a few points if I was grading it. But I think it was fun to see it and have some laughs.|0
Just awful . It 's almost unbelievable that , with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett , such a work could have gone to print without a word of protest . For some time , readers of my blog have expressed the opinion that I would do well to ignore Hammett 's work in the first half of his career, when he was writing pulp fiction , and only reread his work when Hammett was on the cusp of developing his first major work as a novel, and then only in order to discover new insights and a better appreciation of what had previously been missed.|0
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie begins. Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is Sarandon.|1
Well, I fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but I literally just watched it- during a PBS membership drive- and frankly I'm too excited NOT to say anything. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety.|1
As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow just lost that. I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too.|1
Nothing about this movie is any good . It 's a formulaic predictable `` romantic comedy '' geared to make money. The only reason you should see it is to see what other movies it will spawn out of its self-satisfied world . The plot is basically like a standard `` romantic comedy '' with the usual formula of a girl who has to be rescued . The only thing is the script doesn ' t seem to know how to sell its plot . The hero has to save the girl from the bad guy who doesn't like her .|0
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don't know how many times.Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer.|1
I really could n't get into this movie . The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so that he will admit that she's the mother of Jesus, but she wants the confession in exchange for eternal life . It's not clear whether the torture really happened or not because at first she is in the process of committing a crime by killing someone. She is then told that the confession is for the soul of the killer. But then she confesses to the killing but she wants the confession first . The other person she wants to torture is the father of the murderer.|0
`` The Long Kiss Goodnight '' is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller , and a career breakthrough for the author. The book opens with the death of her lover's father, who leaves the young woman a fortune of inheritance. Unfortunately, the father is not the person she thinks he is, as the real man, her lover, had died two years before. He had cheated on his first wife and left her destitute and heart broken, but the mother of the man had left him a small fortune, which was enough to secure the young woman's financial security.|0
I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30 , 2006 and thought that it was even better than it's first run in theaters. I remember the first time I heard the trailer in late spring or early summer, I didn't watch it, since I couldn't stand the trailer or the first half of the movie, but I went back to see it in theaters after the release of The Rock. The Rock is a much better movie that the first time I saw the movie and even better when seen as a second time in theaters with a fresh and new mind set.|0
My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60 's ... In these memories, Belphegor seemed to me a character made from myth and reality, who lived under the shadow of the devil. In the 60'S Belphegor was the devil incarnate, who in reality was a kind of monster that had no soul, and who lived only on human blood and brains. Now, I understand that such a story could have a moral meaning. In this case, the monster's soul has become human.|0
"Though I have watched Salò, I do not know if excrement tastes tart. If it does, this ""film"" is accurately titled. So much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense I would. Detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure."|1
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver . He meets up with a young woman and has an intimate moment in a dark alley. When she asks him for his name , the man tells her “ I am John Smith ” . The woman looks at him like he’s insane. He is then told to get into the trunk of a car. The driver of the car is a man and he seems very nice. But that’s not the only thing that makes him nice. He’s rich and his wife is pregnant.|0
I love most movies and I 'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least see what he's got to say. And I'm sorry for the long delay! Now, I was going to write about my feelings towards the movie and how I felt about the acting but then I saw a picture of the movie poster and the movie was on Netflix. I figured why not take this opportunity and do my own review! So if you're a regular reader you've seen a review on Netflix before, now you've got another one to read!|0
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap.|1
""" While sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. With material like this, timing is everything (Michael Moore knew to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. In 2006, mockery of the well-settled Bush Administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."|1
"Hello again , I have been thinking about this movie all my life . I saw it when I was 9 years old , my brother and I and my father were playing the games . When I saw it I was shocked ,I thought the movie sucked . I hated the music . But then my mother took me to the theatre . I sat down and started to watch it and as I was watching the movie I was getting really into it . I started to think ,""why am I watching this film ?"" I didn't have a clue as to why I liked this movie or anything ."|0
"Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know about Harry Nilsson do a little research and you'll see that Harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special ""The Point"" or ""Everybody's Talking"" from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with ""people let me tell you bout my best friend"" - the theme song from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."""|1
Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly.|1
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport , ace reporter Dan Carter ( Harry Kerwin , he is also credited as a producer ) is trying to cover what is being reported on the news. The flesh feast is going to be an amazing movie. The concept of this type of film is to get people who watch the movie to watch the movie and share it with the rest of the world to make them watch the movie. It is not just the story that needs to be told it is also a message that needs to be shared.|0
I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it.|1
My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count . This is worth seeing for those interested . I know I have seen it before many times but this time it really caught my attention . This video tells you the story behind one of the richest man in the world , Warren Buffett , his relationship with his mother . Warren Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska on April 10, 1930 . The Buffett family are from the small town of Sun CITY , Nebraska . Warren’s father and mother died in the same year before Warren could have been born.|0
"If you enjoy suspense this movie has it . The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her ability to be an actress . The acting throughout is superb . My only negative comment would be the lack of CGI . But I suppose that this is to be expected in a movie this old and with a small budget. I can't say I enjoyed this movie as a whole, but at the same time it wasn't half bad. I'm not entirely sure I'd consider this one a ""great"" horror flick, but it was certainly well made and not in need of a sequel."|0
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured.|1
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.If you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't, BTW), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's.|1
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing crud! Incidentally, the bit about Canada joining the US didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President(but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that).|1
This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time).|1
"I can't disagree with a previous comment that ""Driving Lessons"" is more than a little twee, but one man's indictment is another's endorsement, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself.I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress."|1
WARNING: PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality.|1
I must admit that I did n't get around to seeing this movie in the theater . As it was not in my budget, I had to watch it on DVD . While watching it for the very first time, I was very impressed with the story . The music score by the great John Williams was a must see . And as for the acting performance, the main cast members of this film did justice to their characters . The performances of these main cast members were quite good . The film was worth watching . I really liked the movie .|0
First - nick-623 , Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941 , not 1942 . They did n't have to predict Pearl Harbor , if they had n't, the Japanese would n't have invaded , because they n't have enough resources to build nukes at that time . It was in 1941 n'2 , not 1941 n'2 . I n't even in 1942 , n'3 , n'4 n'5 , you know ? n'6 , you'd have the Japanese n'American war, n'7 , then they'd have the German n'Russian n'English war .|0

No redeeming features , this film is rubbish . Its jokes do n't begin to be funny . The humour is so forced and not even remotely funny . The story doesn't make any sense , its just an excuse to go to the seaside . A waste of good money and effort . What's wrong with this movie...It's a good film, just like all movies should be...the plot was well thought out, but not too predictable. The story itself was interesting...the ending was predictable, and it was easy to predict.|0

And in the second half, we talk about what we want for our children and our kids. In the first segment, I talk about how I met my wife, how my daughter is growing up, and my son has grown into a man. My wife’s first boyfriend was a man who had been in a previous relationship with my wife, and at some point in her life she started to date another man.|0

I went into this movie with an open mind . I had been too lazy to go to the video store and get something that fit the bill. I liked what I saw and read the synopsis. Then I saw the picture . And I was in. So what is this about ? The story is about how a man goes to Iraq to find and bring back a man who may or may not be alive. He gets killed. He goes back to find out what happened. What is really cool about the film is how it does not focus on the actual story of how the man came back.|0
Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting.|1

( The beginning might be a spoiler ... ) '' The Eye 2 '' is the sequel to `` The Eye , '' an action-thriller adventure set in a sci-fi version of the year 2027. It is based on a comic by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons . The book is set between the events of the original game and movie, and features many of the same cast members from both of those films. It also features several of the original ''VideoGame/TheDarkAvengers'' villains and characters from that show. It also introduces characters who will not appear on the ''VideoGame/{{Marvel}}'' or ''VideoGame/GuardiansofTheGalaxy'' series.|0
This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. But the sex isn't even arousing. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat.|1
"My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of `` bad '' movies . They're not all bad , but we did notice a common characteristic of all of them - the bad acting . We had originally been looking forward to the evening showing of "" The Bad News Bears "" at the West End Cinema . However, it turned out that the movie was a complete bust and we were very disappointed with it . We had gone to see it hoping for a comedy - something that could be lightened by a little humor ."|0
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683 ' as the 17th century treasure ship the Elba, on its way to Canton (now Guangdong, China), is driven onto a reef in South East Asia by a violent storm. As the crew struggle to keep the vessel afloat, the crew's chief mate and a number of sailors go missing, their bodies later discovered in the wreckage. With a cargo of pearls that had been hidden in the cargo hold, the ship sinks to the bottom, only to be washed aground in shallow water.|0
"I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some dialogue snippets:Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): ""You see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, the other fills. It is so with the world. At present, you are full of power. But you're spilling it, wastefully. And Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket."" Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past."|1
I 've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago. I got to meet the director last year and he is a genius. There are several things he did well in this movie, and some he did horribly. There's so much more in my opinion. I just finished watching it and am so glad I did. The plot is very good and it flows so easily. It is not very violent, although one or two scenes do make me cringe. I can understand that people are going to be uncomfortable with the graphic nature of these scenes.|0
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot.|1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were Greek or Italian so I guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.|1
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment, and two daughters. It takes the mother's journey and shows that all she believed in, was true. As the daughter's relationships with the mother, are tested, and love is tested, we also see how true love is tested. We see some of the pain of it all. I think if you are a mother or if you have a child or if you know any family who has a child, watch this movie!|0
Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer ( supposedly in his first lead role in a feature ) as a former soldier of the US army who gets caught in the middle of a brutal war between an insurgency group of rebels and the regular army. So far I have seen only a few bits and pieces of the movie. I'm sure that there will be more to see after its release. This is a movie worth checking out, even though I have yet to get to know a great many details of the plot as it is being presented to us.|0
This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. The special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. It is a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart.|1
"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated ""Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)."""|1
Movies seem to fall into two categories : films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs , and those that disrupt and disrupt existing norms and beliefs. Most people would be surprised to know how often these two types of films come from the same filmmaker. It could be argued that in this case it is the filmmaker who has established the values and beliefs they want to uphold. But it is also easy to see where this has an impact, and it does not just affect the values and beliefs of the film’s audience, but that of the director as well.|0
This was pretty bad - from bad acting , bad technical details , bad camera shots , and bad audio quality , this film is pretty disappointing . if it was made as a series , it should have been a good series . since it was only a 1/2 hour miniseries , you'll never be able to get all that good from it . the acting was good , and there were very good scenes . i think there will still be interest in the original series , or at least there was a time in the early 70s when people would have been interested in watching this miniseries .|0
This movie was fabulous . It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film . The directing and camera shots are superb . This movie is definitely a classic in the movie history . In terms of acting and acting , there are not many other films like it . I must say this movie is very beautiful , and the music in it is beautiful as well , this is definitely a great film . I saw the movie yesterday. This is definitely a classic in hitchcock's filmography. And there was no plot, nothing, just a guy with some weird ideas.|0
Why are there no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the Japanese officers brown nose Jim Brown's character.This is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.This is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun.|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen on film, and I've viewed thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it.|1
"The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I've seen in a long time -and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This piece of work seems to have been made ""under the radar"" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust. film making.At times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. But the stunning aspect of the film by Alex Frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction."|1
Fox is pretty lame . They cancel the wrong shows . It 's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written show like this . But hey , its Fox. So , what do we know . It would be cool if the series was picked up and aired on FOX . But , I will tell you that if it is picked up . I would be watching it . And it is a very good show . It doesn't fit with the FOX formula . But , I guess I'm a little biased because I used to work in FOX .|0
"Ed Wood rides again . The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope . But not in the least . I have been an ardent fan of Woody since I first saw ""Annie Hall"" back in the 90's . It was not until recently that I started to understand what I would be getting myself into when it came to the making of this movie. I am now fully aware that I am not in any way , shape or form an ""Annie Hall"" fan like Woody ."|0
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the ""Haaavaad baaa"" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. ""Do you like apples? ""the guy nods or something. ""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf."|1
I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept, not a movie to actually review. But it’s also hard because I feel like I should have seen this before now and that I know the ins and outs of the story much better than ever I would like. I should have known that the main reason this is a movie is not because of anything that happens to any of the characters, but because the movie takes place entirely on a ship.|0
"The director is sweet , as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen , but their movie sucks . It has no charm, no heart, and no life. The movie is not what I would consider ""mature"", but it is not what I would consider ""violent"". I mean , sure , the film has a little blood , and there is an incident where a guy gets impaled by a knife , but it is hardly ""violent"" , in the way that a lot of people would define violence. It does not even have that much gore ."|0
"Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense."|1
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired , it does serve well enough as an anchor for the film. The movie opens with an interview with Joan Rivers, as she talks about one of her first acting jobs, in which she is supposed to play an old man who has to pretend to be a child as part of her part. It’s an intriguing premise. Joan Rivers is going to be playing the old man, but she has other plans for her role and it’s not a surprise when we discover she is going to get her own movie in which she plays herself.|0
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers.|1
Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest, the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history, one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal, as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair, our eyes are truly opened.|1
"...means ""take up and read"", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.Watch out for this young director...he's going places."|1
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
"Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a ""family."" Sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives are coming for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner, explaining ""This is what I wore last Thanksgiving."""|1
"This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, ""well, it's a comedy show,"" so I'll laugh, I guess.I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.Why can't America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.She is not funny."|1
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going out. For a while, the programme would be played on Radio 1, but then a couple of years ago, it stopped being played on the radio and it was on Channel 4 in its own hour, before being made a permanent fixture of BBC4 on Friday nights. The show had a loyal following from kids and their parents, all the way through to adult viewers who would get together to watch or listen on Friday nights.|0
Let me tell you something ... this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as far as originality, and it is one of those films that, when it gets a chance, it will do it right. There were a lot of other Troma films that I liked, some were better than this, in my opinion. However, it will remain in my mind as the masterpiece that the Troma Company was. This is a must see movie, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it.|0
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah ) , each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key, noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. Aided by her , anything but enthusiastic, male friend, the two of them reach the end of their quest , but with a price to be paid.|1
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture ! ! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning , it makes it very atmospheric, and the ending is just epic. I wish i could see this movie on the big screen! It looks really good, and I'm curious about what happens with all the characters on the way. I think that in this movie, the characters can be more real, as we see their inner feelings, as well as their true personalities. I really love this movie and I'm going to see it on the cinema with my family.|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears . I guess I didn't understand the plot but I didn't bother watching the movie after the opening sequence because I had to go to the restroom and then got back and couldn't stop thinking about it. It was like watching a cartoon or something. I had a funny feeling in my stomach that something bad would happen but I was just too busy thinking about the movie to get worried about the outcome. It was so funny I had to laugh about it.|0
I ca n't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely have no clue why but I want to know why they never mention this! I was a horror fan when my father was alive and I really don't remember a lot of the movies he loved and to be honest, most of them I saw in theatres, so I really don't have much of a clue about. But I do remember seeing this movie in the theatre at the age of 11 or 12 and it took me back.|0
A rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later? ), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...It's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due.|1
I love his martial arts style , it is quick , close up and oh so fast , but it is no more than a martial art . Saw him live on a recent UFC on ESPN card and it is hard to tell what it is from this video . He is a very skilled fighter , and although he does not use striking , he is not afraid of getting hit and he is quick enough to pull out of almost everything that may happen . He also has good ground game and has a decent stand up and a good wrestling .|0
What crack are you smoking ? This movie , while gloriously entertaining , is awful ! The action scenes are great but so much filler is added in which is unnecessary ! I can't take the whole movie , it was so good ! It's a good movie but just don't take everything in it , the story is awesome but the acting isn't . There is nothing that I can say about this movie that will impress you more than it already does. I wouldn't even try, especially since I've watched most of the reviews and the comments here.|0
Move over Manos . Back off Boogens . It does n't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach, Calif., has it all, from pristine beaches to high-end restaurants and, of course, world-class celebrities. For the uninitiated: It's a small community of 6,900 people on California's Central Coast, about 10 miles south of Santa Barbara and 20 miles north of Ventura. And that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The entire region is home to about 2,000 millionaires and millionaires' mansions, all of whom have a private club or two on hand.|0
It 's really good to see Van Damme 's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to most of their past work. We are getting a better sense of the characters and the action is getting more exciting. And the soundtrack is growing on me too. There was one line I really liked and it was a good hint as to who the characters are. There's something you can feel from just watching the film that I think makes it stand out. I don't know how I could explain it if it wasn't well put into the script.|0
I was once a big Olsen fan . I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost every day . I have never stopped loving it until now . I really liked this movie when I saw it . I don't remember much of the movie other than the ending . I just remember the movie was awesome . The ending made me cry . I just couldn't stop crying after I saw it . I still remember this movie a lot of the time and have it played in my head whenever I'm sad .|0
This is a film that has to be taken in context . It should n't be seen unless you 've read the book and really want to be as immersed in these characters as if you actually lived with them in their own world. I know the film came out at the end of summer and the book came out earlier in the year so maybe this will change. But for now, it is still a great movie and I cannot recommend it enough. You can purchase it on Amazon or you can download it from the movie's official site.|0
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all of the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script.|1
Obviously , someone was looking at catching onto the `` Blair Witch '' wave.This movie was set up like all the others. It is about a girl called Blair , who was murdered. Her parents think that the police have it wrong , so they hire a private investigator to catch out the killer. The movie was very well made. You can feel the tension throughout the whole movie. It was not scary enough for my taste , but it was good. The acting was excellent .The only thing was that there was no real character development. The whole movie felt like an extended commercial.|0
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date , this year , it is one of my favorites . The movie is set in the present day as it takes the audience back in time to the 1940's . It is well acted by both the main casts as well as the secondary actors . The story is interesting , the music is great , it is very entertaining and the production values are great . This movie was really good. There is not much to complain about, but I still think this movie is worth a try.|0
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero , who takes down the man , who is ruining the world , and makes the best out of it. In a nutshell , I am writing this review on the basis that this is one of the most remarkable films that has been made in recent times. The story is simple , but brilliant and the acting is outstanding . It tells the story about a small town boy who loses his family , gets arrested for murder, and gets released as a pimp , so he starts making money out of this.|0
The horrific production does n't qualify as a `` film . '' It was obviously shot on video tape , and the image quality is very poor: it looks like a grainy home movie on the VCR. The plot, as described on this site , sounds like a joke but is actually very true. The film is based on one of the true stories of the Holocaust, which was discovered in the Soviet Union in 1947. According to the researchers, this story happened in the town of Sobibor, where there was a concentration camp for Jews; it was the largest of all the camps, with around 2,000 inmates.|0
`` Hoppity Goes to Town '' was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleischer (who later went on to become the owners of the Max Fleischer Studios of the same name.) On July 14, 1953, a trailer for the show was shown to theater owners, producers, film distributors and others interested in taking the show to the public. The trailer for ''[[Hoppity]]'' was made in black and white, the same format as many other Fleischer cartoons made in the same era.|0
There were nice characters in here , played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses , plus it had a famous band ( who are sadly gone now) who did a great job. The plot was good , and the ending was nice . I liked the story very much, and I can see why it has made so many films and so many people. I liked the music, the actors, and the set. I can see why it made people want to be in it. I really liked the story too. This was such an interesting film. I really liked it.|0
One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore , `` Ten Cents a Dance '' stars Barbara Stanwyck as a beautiful and self-centred Broadway star on her way to meet with an agent. The two are on a train to San Francisco when they get separated. After Stanwyck makes her way to the station to wait for a train that has already left. When she gets off the train and approaches a man who has been following her, she becomes suspicious of what he might be. At this time, we learn that Stanwyck is not merely a self-centered woman, but rather that she is a shrewd businesswoman.|0
"It starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they transfered to Capitalistic country, here it is, Czech unofficial but well known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making ""art"" and ""politics"" and ""horror"" and ""humor"" and ""film"" and money."|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until fairly recently deciding I should at least try to watch it and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part.|1
Crispin Glovers ' way of acting ( and not only his ) is tremendous . You really want to believe him and see him at work . . . But you can't help but think that there are things going on which have gone on for more than twenty years . . . In which Crispin Glovers has been very busy indeed . . . You feel that Crispin might have been a good detective in the real world . . . but it seems that he has spent much more time in this world than that . . . The man's a mystery and we are not certain who he really is .|0
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card.|1
The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the mountains. When they find the body in the mountains, it leads them to a man who killed his brother and brother-in-law. The story takes place in a small mining town in northern Italy in the 1930's. The film was shot in and around Turin, including in the Castiglioncello area. Filming took place from April to June of 1983. The music score of the movie was composed and conducted by Claudio Simonetti. The director of photography was Giacomo Scappaticci.|0
It 's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film . Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had a very personal vision when it came to his portrayal of the main character. It is certainly an interesting and complex man , but who was the real man? To answer this question , one has to get under the skin of him . Unfortunately , that was not the case . This is because , in order to tell the true story , I had to look back at his life in France in the 60's , when Jean-Pierre lived in a very different time and a very different society .|0
In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her.|1
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning.|1
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. Clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, Matt is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture.|1
How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a ' 1 ' ? I thought `` Manos , the Hands of Fate ' '' was as good as anything in this film. It was better. I agree, I saw this in the theatre a month ago. I don't remember it being very good, but then again I don't remember anything at all. I have seen it twice now, once in a midnight show and then a week after it was released in a normal cinema. The film is great, but man, does it suck to watch.|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show . It is so boring . The jokes are lame . It has nothing on the original and that is a fact . The actors are horrible . It is boring . The characters are pathetic . There is only one reason to watch it . There is nothing to love about the show. Yes, there are jokes and moments that are very funny, but nothing more. The characters are uninteresting and predictable. It takes a lot more than a great laugh to make me like something.|0
WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!! !Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.1. Never, ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away.|1
There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it . I have no idea how the screenplay for this was written . So I don't know whether it's good or poor . As with most screenplays, this is full of plot holes . So if anyone is looking for a good story, please check out the story. If you see a problem, please post a comment . It would be much appreciated. I'm sorry, but this is not a story about good guys and girls. It's about two guys who are out to kill you .|0
Do n't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a little too far with its self indulgent plot. The film's protagonist is a man named David (Josh Peck) who, in his late 20's, gets into an altercation with an older black man named Willie (John Travolta) in which David's car is damaged. David decides to use the opportunity to get some information on Willie, and sets out for his friend's home in the city, where he stays in Willie's basement.|0
With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye Kira, this is re-Atonement. This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace.|1
"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion."|1
Now first let me say I love god awful movies . Especially horror films mainly . I watched hundreds of horror films all the way through ( I still have to watch every one from the beginning to make sure there are not any SPOILERS) . But I have to agree there are some films that just dont fit into the horror cliche . I mean just look at the movies we get . They are horror films of all kinds but there just doesn’t seem to be a lot of the things that horror films are trying to be . The thing is horror is not a cliche .|0
"After an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on ""Columbo"". Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed."|1
Underwoods goofy story about a young man(Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, Arquette is annoying throughout, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable.|1
If you 're looking for a movie that 's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the plot, this movie may just be what you 'd like. I found myself watching this movie as it was going to the theaters, and I did enjoy it. The acting was a little low-key, which was fine, but the movie had a lot going for it and I found myself laughing at the right moments. I guess the thing about this movie was the way it dealt with sex, and the way it dealt with the concept of lust.|0
"This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I 've ever seen. The actors are great (particularly Michael Conrad in his film debut! ), and the production design, costumes, make-up and acting are very well done. And, as I've stated elsewhere in this column, it's not a movie for the faint of heart. It is, in fact, as much of a murder mystery (as in ""who done it, and why?"") as it is a thriller."|0
Okay , . so I went into this loving RuPaul . I still love him/her but think a little less . Well , how do you like what you've seen ? I haven't seen it so I can't be certain . But it's not a bad song , I'll be the first to admit this . And if you like the song , I bet you'll be a fan of the song . If you don't like it , that's okay , too . Well , for those of you who didn't see the preview , I guess I've said my piece .|0
"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down."|1
I was surprised to like this movie since I 'm from the `` check your brain at the door and do not expect any plot twist in this movie. But what made this movie great was the characters. Some of the dialogue was a bit weird, but I didn`t mind that in a movie like this. The acting by the main characters were good. I did not know how this movie would end, but I was glad that it was not like the other movies I have seen or will see in my lifetime. This is definetly one of my favorites.|0
Mind you , it 's not supposed to be , but it is . As a wee tot , I had an uncle in my family that was a bit of a weirdo . He was always a bit of an oddball . It's not easy growing up with someone who is always different . I remember the day I first came into contact with my uncle . I was only six years old , and he had taken me by the hand and led me up to a very large tree to show me what I was about to do .|0
1. I've seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best!|1
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci 's character in this film . If she was supposed to be so self-confident and self-possessed to the point of not caring about what others think ,then why did her actions in the film seem so out-of-character to me ? For a long time I've wanted to watch the movie but had been put off by the fact that it is quite long and I don't like long films. But when I watched it recently, I realized that it really was quite long . I have to say , it's one of my favorites so far .|0
This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life . It is a complete waste of money . It should be rated R . It makes no sense at all . I would give it zero stars if I had to do it . Just go to YouTube and look up how many of this crap movies there have been in the history of films . I would like for you to tell me what all this crap was good for . I just watched a film with a good story line . This isn't the first time I've seen crap like this .|0
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever.|1
This is a total piece of crap. It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert. They have mangled the story and characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).The 1984 movie was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best.|1
We 've all got to start somewhere , it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like George Clooney proved that it's not just what you know, but what you don't. When I was a kid we'd watch the old Hollywood movies on TV , the ones where they have a car chase with a couple of guys with guns , and it's only when somebody gets the bad guy and gets shot , or the bad guys kill the good guy , or whatever it is , that we knew they were bad guys.|0
"OK , so I got ta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for some reason, but after watching it...i was dissappointed. I really hate to do it this way, i'll tell you up front, i'll start with the good

The plot is decent, a lot of stuff happen that i thought was cool. The plot itself wasn't my favourite thing about the film, but the characters, the plot, everything just flowed so well together i just didn't mind it."|0
"Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight."|1
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to zombies. This movie is very entertaining and scary. The acting and effects were done very well. It was filmed in Canada on location. The film is about a chemical weapons attack which releases a chemical gas in a football stadium. The stadium is full of fans cheering for the hometown team, but a chemical attack unleashes a deadly gas into the stadium killing everyone around them. As a result, all the fans turn into zombies while trying to kill anyone who comes in contact with them.|0
"""Nicodemus"" is almost a copy of ""Red"" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it's way into Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects Jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however Clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is Lana."|1
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island . They are then captured by an insane count who plans on killing them both with a sword. A few minutes after he has them tied to a chair with ropes, someone comes and cuts his head off with a samurai sword. So there you have it! That's the story, in its entirety! How could it not be a bloody, horrific tale? In case it wasn't obvious, this movie has nothing to do with sword fighting. In fact, it has no blood, and almost no gore or brutality at all.|0
`` Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own '' , while that may be the case in Korea and Vietnam and Japan. In the United States, in particular, there seems to be more emphasis on local food and community. This book is a wonderful resource for those looking for inspiration and for those who may want to know more. We are grateful to all the contributors to this book, and we hope you will find that inspiration to cook and that you will also learn something from them.|0
OhMyGAWD!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named Sherlock that lived in one of their trees. They also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: They don't MAKE shows like this anymore.|1
Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting cast.Never saw this one before - am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs over the threshold. If I continue watching, it will be just to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper.But after reading the other viewer comments, I'm not very optimistic.The opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously done in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous.|1
"I can't say if ""The Cavern"" is a ripoff of ""The Cave"" because I haven't seen that. I've seen ""The Descent"" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. Hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. There are times when I guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting?"|1
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (luscious brunette looker Katja Biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the Mabutos. Director/screenwriter Jess Franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache.|1
"1 ) Bad acting.2 ) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet , it sure looked like home on the set of a Sci-Fi film .3 ) For me personally , there was nothing in that film which made me go "" I have to see this movie . "" It was just a film , and that's it . No character development , nothing really special . The only thing I found was that they were shooting it in a real rain forest , so I can guess what happened there . That's about all ."|0
"Man , I never laugh so much this year , and it 's pretty hard to make me laugh . It 's very hard , I guess . . . And , I guess it 's very easy for you to say ,
"" I don 't care how long it takes . . ."" It 's very easy for you to say , it 's too late ,
"" I 'm too old ,
"" I know I 'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer . . ."" And , it 's not my problem to prove that . . ."|0
Yeah great cult TV series . Great atmosphere , top script and good performances make this a class A candidate in my book . This is a must for any cult lovers . A truly great tv show that has one of the best running themes i've ever seen on a tv show and a good script . A lot of time and care went into this series . I have yet to see a show that has been made in a really good way. The ending was a bit sad and i felt a bit cheated. But it is an amazing tv show .|0

Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. But in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects. The blood effects are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives, this runs kind of like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?)|1
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects."|1
"First of all, even IMDb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is VERY ""gappy"". Even main characters are missing from it like Buddy for example.Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much, is because I was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.The plot line itself is good. It could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting."|1
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school . I thought it was awesome. I am so glad that I got to see it with my friends and family. We watched it again with my father the other night. He is a huge fan as well, so there was a lot of laughter while watching it . It was really well made and well acted . I think it will be a popular movie in the future. I saw it with my family the other night and was really surprised by it.|0
In terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen . The list includes “Lola Montè”, “Fosse/Lupa” and “My Brother the Pig” but in my opinion this is the worst. It may be because of the production , which was made by Carlo Ponti and directed by Emilio Miraglia , but the truth is this film is just terrible. The actors are horrible, the plot is weak , and the production is awful. And the worst thing of all is that it has no originality . It is a mediocre adaptation of a famous novel.|0
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up to be an alien. The alien kids are being raised by their father and the father of the children. In the midst of all this, they are confronted with a giant robot. The children have been raised to take orders from others. They want their father to be the one in charge. As they grow older, the aliens get more and more aggressive, and in turn the kids are more and more worried. As they grow older, the kids get more and more frustrated and violent.|0
For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out.|1
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time . It 's dull , ponderous , badly written , badly directed . It 's not an original concept , it 's unoriginal . It has very little plot or character development , and it doesn 't do a thing to advance the plot . It has some fine acting from the lead actor , but not much. It 's a very dull movie that makes you wonder if you are supposed to like it . If you don 't , it doesn 't even bother you enough to laugh at it .|0
Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this film. It begins promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the U.S., this is NOT it.|1
"This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel . Here is the synopsis from Wikipedia:

This is a low budget feature-length television film, produced by Robert K. Miller, and released on VHS on August 26, 1993, and on DVD August 25, 2003. The film was produced by Robert K. Miller, who is an actor and producer. Robert K. Miller has also appeared in many episodes of The Outer Limits. The movie was originally broadcast in the United States on VHS tape on August 26, 1993."|0
First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing.Second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? They were killed *before* the surgery took place! Third - how the heck did Lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use?|1
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD . I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst browsing and thought its a shame that a movie is going to have to wait until November. I was wrong! The movie is called DIE SCREEN and it's only been out in Australia and New Zealand for six weeks now. Here are the links to the two DVD's for your reading pleasure. The first one has been out in the US for a couple of weeks now, and you can check it out over there.|0
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."""|1
"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $30,000."|1
As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority , I was n't sure what to expect when I tuned into the new series of The CW's Riverdale. I don't recall the show being as well received as it has been in season 1, but I am glad I was able to watch it and learn more about the cast. Riverdale is about a town in Kansas with a rich history. Archie , Betty and Veronica, along with their friends Jughead, Blossom, Reggie Mantle, Cheryl Blossom, and many others. The title refers to the river that runs through the middle of the town.|0
This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted those hours of my life back . For god 's sake , this guy made the worst movie ever ! I will never get the point of what was in this movie . I did not even care to know whats going on , and it did not interest me . This movie was awful ! I have to hand it to this guy for giving us a true story for a change. And I say that without any reservations - the man has a story to tell us. He is an honest journalist and tells a good story.|0
"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!!"|1
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it 's a load of hogwash ( the CPUSA was an international communist organization that had nothing to do with Russia, the Soviet Union, or Stalin), but that it seems to be a load of hogwash. In many ways, I think the movie tries too hard to pretend that it's about an ordinary family's journey to join up in the Labour Party when, in fact, it was a political organization founded and directed by a group of internationalists who saw the struggle against fascism as being fought by working men of all countries.|0
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the IRA and goes on the run in London !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . Things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a stark realism . However as soon as Fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( What ?|1
One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third, the fourth and the Fifth. But the people who make films are people too. The problem is that the people who want to make films have an idea about how the world is and how the world will be. And they are often influenced by those who have influence over the people who have influence over the film world. It is possible for an idea to be influential for a long time and to not be influenced at all by the time one is old.|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time.|1
"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. ""Constantine""), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la ""Manos The Hands of Fate""). Now that I've seen ""Dr. Gore"" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly execrable."|1
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film ? it was given to me on video but it was so awful. it just didn't do anything to entertain me, just bore me to the point i had to take it off, i didn't like this movie, i really didn't . the plot was stupid , the acting was poor and so were the editing and the writing. I saw this movie at the local movie theater with a few people who didn't care for it so we had to sit in a dark room for the first half an hour.|0
"The recent release of `` Mad Dog Morgan '' on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print run of the film, as it has a number of changes that I have never heard of before. For example, the first scene that takes place in a restaurant has the restaurant name censored out, as well as the title ""Mad Dog Morgan's"", which makes it a more accurate description. The entire final scene also has a scene censored out of what originally was supposed to be a scene where the two men have a fight and are dragged away to jail by police."|0
Sometimes there 's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe . This is one of those films. Just when you think you've seen it all, you discover yet another aspect to the film. The thing is, I've seen every horror film made, and this is one of the worst. The plot is not original, nor is there any sense of urgency or menace. There is also not one ounce of horror or suspense in the film, it's a bunch of cheap scares, cheap special effects, and a plot which is a complete non-entity.|0
"Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched .... well maybe its the writers but the people are the ones who are to blame in the end

There's nothing wrong with that show, except that the people that make the show are usually the wrong kind of people. People who want to live their lives as if there is no other world but this one we're living on, as if there's nothing beyond it. People who have never seen or experienced another world."|0
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad (John Heard) who works in a firehouse (with his firefighter daughter Amy) as the father and a daughter (Kelley Scott) who is in the fire department. But as the movie progresses we discover that Amy and the father are in love and are making love in their firehouse. After a while he proposes to her and during the proposal Amy says she loves him. All the scenes are shot in black and white to give a realistic impression.|0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak , it 's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a horror story would be more than a decade before it came to fruition. Kolchak , the protagonist of The X Files, is a man with a dark past. He's been through a lot as his family was torn apart by his father's illness, and then his mother's illness, and eventually his own death, and he has lived through all of it with nothing but a handful of friends for companionship.|0
This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to be done on the next day. For example, these guys should be doing a job on their next day and get paid, but are given the job on their day, and not paid. The guys are assigned to the job, and do what they are assigned, but get fired. The first guy is a girl who thinks that if the guys will do the job, they are going to get paid.|0
Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the dialog. And the music was nothing great. Anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. And what does a Kansas teen know about shopping in Soho....couldn't we have had a better line here?|1
O boy , was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music , it was hard to hear the lyrics.If it is the song that you like, I would rerecord it to be sure it is the right one.I am sorry to hear this is not available to the people in the area.I will tell the people in my area the new song is now available.Thank you.I will post this song on youtube and tell everyone about it.Thank you.I would be glad to do anything I can.It was a great pleasure listening to you sing the song.Thanks.|0
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content. The uniforms and weaponry of both the U.S. and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weaponry of the Berbers were perfectly accurate as well. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful. Procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for.|1
"I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.Ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call ""assistant"" to Evie, a retired actress."|1
The greatest tragedy man faces is that , capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this moment on, our destiny will belong to us.We will make the decisions; no one else will.And it will no longer be an accident of circumstance or a misfortune of birth that determines our life.A man can not live by chance; he needs a plan.Our life will belong to us by right of conquest: to those who will accept us as they find us, or not to those who reject us as they find themselves . . .|0
"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone)."|1
"I 've waited 9 years to watch this film , simply because i never saw it advertised on TV . it was supposed to be released in america as ""the new hollywood western"" , but it never came out in america . that was a mistake because i have a very vivid recollection of it . that was in 1995 , i watched the first half hour of ""the new hollywood western"" and i remember being amazed and amused . i think this movie is a great success for hollywood , a huge box office success and a huge success at home as well ."|0
The subject matter was good, direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major. The acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle.|1
"I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid . I loved it . Whilst there are a few things I wish they hadn't cut out I don't think it's because they were ""bad"" but more because they didn't fit the plot . If you don't know the movie it is set in the late 70's early 80's when the world economy was going down the toilet and there were a lot of people making very little money with a lot of hope and lots of people going broke ."|0
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle . I could n't believe how bad this film was . I watched it merely once in my life and then forgot about . It is as bad as ever . It was a waste of a great actor . But as I was looking forward to seeing it being released here in India , I was not surprised how badly it was filmed . But the plot was so dull and boring and so far from the film's promise . It is a film that will live and die . It is as much of a failure today as it was during its time .|0
I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. The cast was made of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. The story line is great too. The thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea.|1
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost £20 on ebay. Add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it.|1
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... The film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... If this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... As for the actual film, I recommend watching the MST3K version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother...|1

"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking ""surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on"", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far."|1
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film ? ? Its not because of money spent on CGI ? I think that this is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. I don't know how to describe the look of it but I think the colours were so beautiful that it would have been very hard to make them in a real world. When the actors are speaking it is like I am actually there watching them. And in the film there are beautiful images which I can never describe in words. And I think that this film has some great lines that I want to read.|0
I can not stress how bad this movie is . This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making a good movie and just shoved it down the viewer's throat . That movie is just not funny at all . The dialogue and acting is so bad i dont know what the point was at all . I would not reccommend this movie to anyone . There are some funny moments in the movie , but after that the story line is so lame i didnt even finish it , this movie couldnt have been worse , and i hope they take the money that they earned in the box office and invest it wisely .|0
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of lonliness is the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away.|1
All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil.|1
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not Europeanbut a sleaze Americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. This installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.Now what I find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.These sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre.|1
Being a former MST3k watcher , even I found this movie unwatchable . The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful acting , the poor CGI, the unappealing costumes , even the lousy music was just too much to watch . I didn't care for any of it but I still found it enjoyable enough to check out . I was surprised to find out the movie is based on a manga by Haruki Murakami. It was also the first time I was introduced to his work after seeing the anime adaptations and I found I enjoyed it even more.|0
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in many memes, there have also been memes in which memes are made of celebrities and/or products themselves, usually with the idea that the celebrity is not actually the celebrity at all. In most of these cases, the celebrities are not well liked in their own right, but it still seems like people like these celebrities so much they would have the bad taste to use them for a joke, so they use celebrities like these to make fun of.|0
Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking at you! Sony's got the rights to Harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! Anyhow, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully underknown, full of great stories, greater music, and it could have been 3 hours longer and I'd have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, where it played to a packed house. They were turning people away at the door!|1
Really? Is this necessary? How can somebody make such a film? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the Ending. Completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood!!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car persecution, and I know he can't act.|1
This film's a big bore. It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. It starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.Surya & Jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? He disappears totally after a good half an hour!. Santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.AR's tunes sure will last for sometime. But he could have done better. What ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.|1
This is one of the best films I 've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles.I wish this will get more distribution. I hope it gets the Oscar nomination and wins it. One of the greats and definitely worth watching. This film is not the first film about two women but it is one of the most important ones. I thought it was a perfect film and I hope that it receives the Oscar. It is one of the reasons why I went to the Cannes Film Festival. There are a few others but none as important.|0
I will never , ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 . Even at the young age I was , I felt that this is how I wanted to see my life . This is when I decided that I had enough of the ordinary . I wanted to be on a mission to change the world . I had no idea that I would go on to do this . When I went to the church for my confirmation , I had the idea of becoming a missionary . I just felt like this is what I had been looking for .|0
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching. Then I didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry.|1
"OK, Number one-this ""film"" is a ""90's"" version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers! Number two-As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I walked in halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but It's just not believable to me that little skinny Omar Epps can chase down a big grown man, without a gun, and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous ""plot""."|1
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. Obviously this isn't intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about £20 to make.|1
"For a really wonderful movie , you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good or bad - it might change your opinion a little. And another good movie in which I think you could try out is the one about St Francis , where he was born and died as a child , and in which he was the main character . And finally, and this is quite easy, you could go and see the movie that's based on a book called "" The Boy who Cried wolf "" , because this book has a lot of truth in it ."|0
"Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the ""hilarious"" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage."|1
I loved this movie when I was a teenager . LOVED it . It has n't grown up with me , but I think of it every now and again, and it gives me a good kick in the balls every time . It is not for everyone , but those who do have to go, go , go . This is a great movie , and a really great comedy . The acting is brilliant , but the screenplay is just too good , and the humor is just too much . It's so bad it's funny .|0
"(Contains spoilers)People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the ""Mississippi"", but - Catherine Deneuve."|1
I've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. I later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously.|1
i'm not going to ramble on about it but i'm just going to make it brief. basically for those who don't know how prue actually died........... the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit piper and prue with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the spell which send him away but not vanquished.

"Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking -- and is thought by the local folk to have been the inspiration for the movie. ""I love that movie because it's one of my favorites and I think it shows that people can change. I love the character because she's strong and she can face any problem and still get up,"" she told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in an interview to be aired Tuesday on the show's ""Early Show."" ""I have such a sense of gratitude for what my husband and I have accomplished."|0
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career.|1
I 'm not sure where to start with this . In short , it was a disappointing movie . Having said that , it was certainly worth seeing . However , it is not for everyone . It is a bit much in length , and has a few slow parts . It could have been cut down by a quarter . But for me , its worth it , because it gave me a better insight on what the movie world thinks of its actors , actresses , and actors in the industry . As for the movie , it is one that is full of great acting , and great performances .|0

If
you've followed this blog in some time, you probably know how much I have
loved the new feature film version of The Mummy. It's one of those films
where I was instantly drawn in by the visuals and story, and also fell in love
with the characters I had just met in the trailer. That movie is one of my
very favourite of all time."|0
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit. How darethey? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.I really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.|1
It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors.|1
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. As I have pointed out, there are differences between the two stories but they are more than just verbal. There is a very real story behind each. The Grinch, as we have been reminded this week, is the hero of this story. The Grinch is the bad boy. He is the villain. He wants to steal Christmas and he can’t stand being told what to do by The Cat in the Hat, the good guy.|0
a great movie , with a rather unclear political message . it´s shot in a theatrical style , i.c . the movie goes on , i do not understand why it does not do a sequel , it was a really great movie and i would love to see a sequel , but as the movie does not go on , i can´t imagine that the second film will be able to be done as a movie without being a TV movie , but with the new technology it could be done , i would like it if a second film will be made .|0
Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator Bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film. That said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance.|1
"I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there's a problem. And that problem's name is Casey Affleck. Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be ""exert as little effort as possible at all times"". Or ""why speak when you can mutter?"" Or maybe ""put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls""."|1
"This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad ""Alien lifeforms inhabit earth"" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian ""Judgement day is at hand, seek Jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell"" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this."|1
"I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded , it talks of violence and what there doing , I was a bit put off because I think a film should never be jaded but the way the movie is put , I found to be jaded

It was pretty good and it's not a good movie, but it has to be said that a lot of people liked it. It has an interesting plot and some interesting scenes and the editing was good. There is a lot of violence and blood but it isn't gratuitous."|0
In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film ( imagine giving a camcorder to the elderly and asking if they would like to film themselves walking to the grocery store; they would be offended), it's just so sad. I feel as if the author has given up hope of a decent story and just wants us to enjoy the fact that he is able to say something that makes his readers think. There was nothing in his script to give a reason to care or even to like his characters or their motivations. Nothing.|0
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties.|1
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno ( Alex Linz ) in a catholic school who discovers he has powers of telekinesis but also of teleportation. He has to decide whether he should continue to use the abilities or give up on his dreams. He soon finds he needs to develop his abilities in order to save people. He finds that he is able to manipulate objects and people with his telekinesis. Soon, he is working for a gang that want him to use this powers for them, but the only thing they care about is money.|0
"This film is just as bad as ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"". I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast.I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news."|1
whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot . In this case once was enough . Iron Eagle II has been done and done right and you can still go on playing it if you wanted to . If you are a true movie buff like me then I highly suggest you watch the Iron Eagle movies . They are just pure fun . The first two films were just fun and the later ones are even better . After watching both of them now you are really craving to see something else because they are just perfect .|0
Let 's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché , as Korean romance dramas and movies go . First of all , the drama itself was a bit predictable . However it's actually more than that , the story of the drama is actually pretty fresh . I actually liked it and I think that if you watched it from beginning , then the story might become more interesting . It has a good pace and it doesn't feel rushed . Plus I'm glad that we got more than one story in the first half of the film, as it added something to the film as well .|0
I 'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here . First is from the view of the people that I know that enjoyed the film . Then from the view of those that did not like the movie and are looking for another film to enjoy in the meantime . And of course I'll try to talk about it in a way I think it would make a good movie for everyone . So without further ado , let's get on with it . Before the movie even begins , I should probably preface this review with this fact . I did not enjoy this movie .|0
Wow . I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago , and I do n't think I 'll ever get to see it again ! But I have a question - is it me that has lost my appetite ? In a way it is you , your taste buds are getting old and you think that the new movie is not for your taste. That 's the only explanation I have for your lack of appetite. You see , the problem is - you think the new movie sucks - and you 're right , it does !|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on watching this movie DON'T! I warn you... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically horrifying, not in the Horror movie kind of way, to watch. I mistook this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I had noticed I made a mistake I decided to watch this one anyway. I wish I wouldn't have. This movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent.|1
"I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed . The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to the point where I was not sure what was going on when I went to bed. The acting was excellent throughout, and I had a hard time believing in the fact that his father was not around to back him up as much as I thought he would. I am so glad I had the chance to watch it. ""I just watched Eddie Monroe and I have to say it was one hell of a performance. A very emotional and powerful performance."|0
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and I've always been a fan of Foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, HATED this movie.Although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in Lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.Although the story chiefly revolves around M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.|1
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. I didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all.|1
"First i got ta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code . sure , it has a bit of the latter, with a bit of the earlier, with a bit of the latter . sure , there are some really cool things to take note of . okay so if you haven't noticed , i like movies . so here goes ...

there are some things that will keep you interested in the film regardless of how bad i think it is or how far off base i think it is , or the way it goes ."|0
Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie.|1
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry , like the first time I saw this movie . Not because it's the story , but because of the cinematography and the way the actors are doing all the emotional scenes . I am really sorry to all those who have cried because of this movie . I cried as well and that was just my reaction . It was the first time for me to see a romantic comedy (even the trailer makes you cry). The story was different. I am glad to be alive and to know that I will find love in my life (I hope).|0
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband."|1
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. On his first night, he’s locked in a cage with his father, the man’s sister, and a woman he says he’d just met. There is a note saying they will be killed if the boy does not give them his father’s gold ring. His father is a murderer. And he has a wife and children. So, they must take him. So, he’s locked into the cage.|0
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream : Do nothing , be a loser and you can earn millions of dollars. And you can be rich and free in the US, the most powerful nation in the world. They will tell you they are living a dream. I am an American and I say that the American Dream is dead and that we need to do more than just complain and make fun of other people for not having it. I say that the American Dream has died because our government is in debt up to our ears.|0
"As a big Dostoyevsky fan , I had always been disappointed with Hollywood 's halfhearted attempts to get into the mind of the great Russian writer , and I was not happy about the idea that his story should have been ""borrowed and adapted"" to Hollywood . Dostoyevsky was the kind of writer whose stories were as much about the characters he had created as their circumstances were. In his case, that was something of a double edge sword, because it was impossible for any movie to capture his world and yet be ""faithful"" to his vision."|0
"Age of Steel follows up the previous episode , Rise of the Cybermen , which was excellent in some respects, but also suffered from the fact that we only had half the story, and only had half the characters we needed. I am a huge fan of this series and I would happily buy the next one even though it isn't on DVD yet, especially when it's one of my favourite programmes. The story picks up right from the beginning, with the Cybermen returning to Earth from their ""home"" planet."|0
A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this. Honestly - just don't bother. A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this.|1
I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play. As I watch Jacobi, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding Hamlet's character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else.|1
This is precious . Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue . The story moves along in a very fast pace . You can feel the tension building in every scene . The characters are very well developed . You just want to be with each one of them on their way to the final destination . From the get-go this was one of those movies I was looking forward to . As a result , I had to wait in line at the local cinema to see it . This is no wonder as the movie is well acted .|0
"I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire"". To begin, I'd say that ""Water"" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of ""heat"" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships."|1
"This movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It looked like they made no effort to make the ""future"" look in the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). Additionally, its pretty obvious that Don ""the Dragon"" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film)."|1
"I love this movie. At first, I didn't expect much of this movie since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (I've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since I saw ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should've played Minnie's part and vice versa."|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in the pockets of the kid. If there is anything in this it is from a guy trying to figure out what it is and when it is coming out what the value of the work is relative to what he could have gotten from a kid who worked on it. And if there is value to him, he isn’t sharing it with anyone else. That’s the only conclusion that makes any sense.|0
I grew up in the 90s ; therefore , you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the 20th century, and as a consequence , it was my first impression that i had to learn to understand that , because they were all so different. The first première i saw was the première of that movie , when i was only 8 , and although , that movie was a masterpiece in every aspect , , it was the scene that i will remember , and i will say that i loved that scene , but it made me want to see the movie that follows .|0
No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc.|1
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This blatant rip off of Universal Soldier (Which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. The main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. Van Peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing.|1
This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time.|1
.... OK , small-town , clueless sheriff ? Check . Sheriff 's hot daughter ? Check ? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of the bride ? Check . Bad guy 's brother ? No problem ! But there was one problem : What was going on with the guy's brother (the bad guy 's brother) ? The man was supposed to be there that day. And his brother wasn't, but it didn't look as if that was going to change the situation . It looked like the wedding was going to be held without him.|0
"Imagine every stereotypical, overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters. Throw in a mix of ""period"" music and wailing electric guitars during the ""rumble"" scenes. Then pass the time trying to figure out (or care) which of the Deuces is going to be killed in the (anti)climactic final rumble.I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical, or Oscar-nomination vehicle."|1
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films , Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray , Jeremy Brock brings a unique sensibility and depth of experience to directing. Brock is best known for writing films that are deeply personal and compelling, and have earned worldwide acclaim and multiple Oscar nominations. Now Brock will bring the same level of talent and expertise to his own feature debut, a psychological thriller that he hopes will have audiences thinking of what they would do to survive if something as horrific as what happens in this film were to happen in their lives.|0
This movie totally sucked!!! Don't even rent it! You'll hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins cant fly! Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. I am not who you think I am!|1
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. It's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death.|1
Right ... so you have a dam , tons of water ( that seems to flow really really slowly ) and you have a hole where the dam should be. Now, let's add another dam. There is now lots of water running through the small hole and you still have a lake. You add a dam to make up the hole and water flows through it even faster! So if you add two dams and a hole the water will have nowhere to go. And now you have lots of water that you can't drink.|0
First of all , the nature in the movie is beautiful , and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Second of all I want to know if we can get into a serious conversation about the fact that most of the world, including most American people, does not even know what a Mongol is. And it is sad when they do not even know that we are a minority. A couple of years ago, we went to a local Mongol restaurant. We were seated with the Mongolian woman who was seated across the table and we were able to get some information about Mongolia and the people.|0
'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half. 'Thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story.|1
"This film gives new meaning to the term ""uneven"", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him."|1
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. The father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama.|1
"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful."|1
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home.|1
This was a great movie , I would compare it to the movie The Game . You get to the end and realize that the movie is just a prologue for the final fight . Its a very good prologue . I enjoyed it alot . This is definitely one of the best movies ever . I liked it . The acting is amazing . I would like to see the movie in 3D , its just a matter of how well the 3D can transfer to the screen . This movie is definitely on the list for best fight movies ever made .|0
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in a Sneak Preview, and left after half an Hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I., still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended.|1
"Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF actors.Boy was I wrong.The direction and story telling in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production.I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this ""film"" but have to say they were conned.If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed."|1
If there are people that do n't like this movie , I do n't think they are human . This movie is an excellent story . I only wish I could get this movie on VHS as it was very well done . It is hard to find any positive reviews for this movie , which is unfortunate for this is a good movie that deserves better. If this is the best thing in history to hit the DVD market , there will be a lot more crap films being put out . This is probably the best movie I've ever seen.|0
My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store . From the cover it looked like something you might find in a sci-fi book , but once it started I realized it was a horror film that had to have been made in a dark corner of the movie studio. When the lights went out I was scared for the first time I ever had been , not so much for what was inside of the movie ( I have seen worse ) but for what wasn’t . I had never seen anything like it .|0
"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their ""Silly Symphonies"" series, ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog)."|1
"The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years . There have been other films before that delved into the same subjects as this film , but nothing has been as deep and as meaningful as ""The Way of the Gun."" The only downside to this film is it will take a while to watch all of the way through. As you watch the film, you'll begin to realize that there are elements that were added to give it a whole new dimension that didn't appear in the film when it came out."|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. I wasted enough time myself watching it, so I will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. The Cavern is one of those.|1
"This movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly ""haaaa"" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).For everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled ""comedy."" The movie strictly follows the formula of the later ""Scary Movie"" films, as well as ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating."|1
"When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice , as my original intent was sold when i went to see the original movie , i was sold into this particular story , it had a twist and everything , I liked the twist and liked how it ended it all , i had no expectations , I was surprised that the ending was how i saw it in my head after watching the movie . If you are one who is looking for more than just the ordinary action movies, then look no further than the latest release of "" The Avengers "" in theaters ."|0
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. Sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.The Evil Below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads.|1
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more. The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending.|1
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional . Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the plot, nor did I give much thought as to why I should watch it or how I should spend the evening. However I was surprised to find myself enthralled by a movie which was more of an entertainment than any I had ever seen before. The plot is based on the true story of a young lawyer who had been in a serious relationship with his client for many years. A friend of their mutual friend discovered this and confronted them.|0
"I can just picture how this movie came to be:""So how else can we screw up our careers?"" ""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place!"|1
"Nurse Charlotte Beale ( the lovely Rosie Holotik ) has arrived to Dr. Stephens ' clinic for the insane prepared to do anything to get out of the asylum. In fact they are going to have a special treat today for all the ladies who have been waiting patiently all day. The doctor is not in today but this will be a special treat for you ladies and that is going to start now."" Nurse Holotik said. Nurse Charlotte Beale started the special treat, she pulled out a rubber band that she looped around the wrist of one of the women to hold it on."|0
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 yrs at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store the old lady was at. However, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it hasn't been already. A bit of trivia, Illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals.|1
there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda , that story told about young writer who is writing a novel about love with his girlfriend and his brother . and the story of this is very touching that every person must have watched it once or a million times . it is not only about young man but it also deals with different characters of young writer . they are very interesting and we all will feel what it feels like to be in a love with someone . the movie tells a story of life . there is no movie director can make a movie so great as andrzej wajda .|0
"If you were enjoyed by watching ""Guinea Pig"" - then you'll like this movie to! ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. Actually the effects are not so realistic like in ""Guinea Pig"", but its still pretty gory. ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. After that you'll see fetish sex scenes. And last one is a torture scene."|1
Not a balanced point of view. The director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. The movie has some criticism of Fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. But that is not the case.The movie barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the MRTA insurgents that took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning.|1
This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better than this) and Blackadder (Not better than this).Mr Bean is a no talking, human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof.|1
Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks , I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger down, as the teacher will have time to point to various things and explain them to the class. However, this is probably only a suggestion because I have not been to this school for over 15 years and cannot remember how the teacher explained things. If you can use it, then you should. I can see that some people don't know what they are talking about when it comes to Mr. Bean because he never speaks.|0
"If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I am a huge fan of ""B"" movies, and I have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. This movie even surpasses the ""so bad it's good"" phase and goes straight on to the ""so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it"" phase.It is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1."|1
"No blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.The acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of ""Nanny"", to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own ""Halfway"" house."|1
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. Some have been adapted to the big screen but most are just that. Borrowed from Hollywood folklore, some are based on historical events and other are just fantasy tales meant to entertain. But what is an authentic tale to Hollywood? Is it as old as Hollywood itself? That’s the big question in this collection of 10 fascinating tales that will make you question everything about your past and your present day world.|0
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and desire, with a shared appreciation of their respective differences and unique gifts and weaknesses. The chemistry between the two leads is electric, especially when they are sharing the same room. We learn in a slow, methodical way how this young couple will navigate the challenges that will come in their way. A little girl with her mother and father are having dinner in their home. She is sitting on the floor next to her father, playing with Legos while they are eating dinner.|0
I really like the show ! ! As a part of Greek Life , I can say that some things are good . The most important is that it is a way to meet people from different backgrounds in a fun way . And that is one of the goals that we try to achieve every season . And I agree with the others about the music ! ! I think this is the most important one . But if I can say one thing it is to try to learn from the experiences the other people have . Because they are human and they have their own way of seeing things .|0
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film. After years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. The kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.Interestingly, it turns out that Mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college.|1
This movie was , of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen , by far the worst . It was the most racist of the films . I have no idea what it was trying to show but it just was not there . I wanted to see something better than this . I am sorry but this was the film of the year . This is the first film that I have seen that was not based in reality . This film tries to be as much like real life as possible . There is no logic , no reality and no reason to what they are doing or what they are showing .|0
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature.|1
`` First Snow '' has an intriguing beginning . A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man in a forest in the middle of Alaska. When the man dies, the old man's house burns down. And it turns out, his fortune is a lie: his fortune was that he was rich. He just lied to get rich. The old man tells the fortune-telling man about his past: He was born in a castle on a hill. As a young boy, he found his horse stolen and his family ruined.|0
"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it."|1
Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that.|1
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true.|1
Better than average World War II-era `` who-dun-it '' featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and had his face tattooed to look like the Joker, Batman and Robin face-to- face, The Joker and Batman face-to- face, and The Joker and Robin face-to-face again. Warner Baxter is the son of James Bond writer John Gardner Baxter, and the younger Baxter is the author of a number of popular Batman stories in DC Comics' Young Justice series, and his Batman: The Dark Knight Returns in the DC Comic's Batman: Year Two.|0
The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment , which was ( thank God ) the last one ever made by the great Stan Lee. This is not a good move by Disney . The whole point of Marvel has been to bring a new generation of comic book readers into the fold so that they would be ready to absorb all that is Marvel Comics and everything that has come since, and you know what that means? The death of the character who made comic books cool and exciting for so many decades.|0
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute , a feel good Saturday night movie , with a message. But I didn't think it would have the depth of characters and characters you can't really help but love. It was fun and I found it to be well made with nice actors . The story line was sweet , and I did like the characters they portrayed. I also liked that the film didn't pull on the heart strings. I think it could have been really great but it was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it .|0
I do n't know which was worse , the viewer 's made dopes of , or the stars in this one . when , and if , you 're in the presence of a genuine diamond you have to wonder how you 've been so dumb to miss it , and then , of course , there is the other option , which is to believe that what you are seeing is nothing but an imposter . and , indeed , there is one thing that is certain about this diamond : he is genuine , and he is real .|0
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I have always liked films set in small towns because there is nothing quite as interesting as living in a place that has been through so many years of change. My father was in the movie as well and I have always felt his presence. The movie also reminded me a lot of the stories of my relatives, both good and bad. The movie has also made me want to see more about the past as well as the story of the current generation.|0
( Contains spoilers ) People who put a Lonely Heart 's ad in the newspaper are often idealists . They believe that someone like you just can't stay single forever . That you're bound to find someone special soon . I think I was like that, but I also thought about how many people had made that same decision . So I didn't expect to be single. I didn't expect to meet anyone . I didn't expect to stay in a relationship for a long time. I thought of what it would be like when I wasn't single.|0
I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable.|1
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. Predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.The staple of roman porno is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh.|1
"Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother/Daughter Estrangement, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really ""sells"" their roles."|1
I'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. This was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to Down Below. Unfortunately unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place off station. I didn't care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair. I like Lochley but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. Personally I can only give it 1/10.|1
This telecast of the classic musical `` Sweeney Todd '' does not do the production justice , but is still worth seeing. It is one of those shows that are made for the theater that you never forget, and one of the great shows of all time. Featuring songs by Stephen Schwartz, the show was written by Schwartz and is based on his own play of that name that he wrote while he was working on `` Sweeney , '' the popular play that opened in New York in 1961. The play was later made into a film in 1970.|0
( This has been edited for space ) Chan-wook Park 's new film is a complex film that is not for all tastes, but if you can find the time to look past the film's shortcomings, you will be rewarded with a film you have to see. There are elements of Korean drama here, of course, but there is also a lot more going on. Park, who has directed films such as The Flowers of War, has a gift for making a complex film, and for showing it in a very personal way that few have the courage to do.|0
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a while . The acting was just soooo bad . The acting just sucked ! The plot sucked ! The writing sucked ! You can't even understand the plot at all because the script was not written well enough to carry it . It was pretty bad . The characters were just not interesting enough to make them feel real . And just when it was about to get going , the story went down the shitter ! I was bored out of my brain and didn't have the time to watch it all in one sitting .|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint.|1
Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ``The Day of the Doctor.`` On the contrary, it was a terrible waste of time. The episode opens with the first appearance of the title character, who looks like he's just gotten out of the shower. You might say that he's ``going to be the Doctor someday.`` I don't believe the show had the slightest chance of doing anything of the sort, because it was the exact opposite of ``Doctor Who'' -- a silly parody that took the form of a Saturday-afternoon Saturday-morning cartoon.|0
Got to confess right up front that I didn't watch this entire movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers sum this one up nicely. It was badly conceived. Badly scripted. Badly acted.But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. And hang. And hang.|1
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster ( though it might be interesting to note that it was released in the UK and not in the US). I had to watch it twice, the second time in order to get the whole story. I can only hope that it doesn't make it's way over here because I can see how it could be very damaging for the industry, even though it is a soft-core porn. For the uninitiated this is the type of movie that was made in the '70s for soft-core movies that were called 'tourist' movies.|0
Honestly , this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting ( Heather Graham could never be funny and I'm sorry to be blunt , but that's just fact ). I did not watch the whole movie . I started to watch the first 45 minutes . I really liked it . I was surprised how the first half was done with good performances . But I really didn't like it in second half . I thought that it was not good . And I really felt like the way that it was played . The ending was good too .|0
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it.|1
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old.|1
After just viewing the movie, I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film?|1
I go this game and it is alright I guess. I just expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. Also the graphics aren't as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst out of the three.|1
"It's painfully obvious that the people who made this ""movie"" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish.The movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever. I'm SURE that I could make a better movie with my friends. To me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much."|1
This is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list.|1
It kicks you in the stomach . There are other films with more convincing characters , a more realistic story , and a better story line but no one has ever done a story like this . You have got to be there to appreciate this film . Now go see it . I agree with you about the other films. In this one I could almost understand the characters if I hadn't been such a total sucker. But I do agree that the acting in this one is amazing, especially by the lead actresses. I would go back again and again to it, for that reason alone.|0
While out divining for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm.|1
Like a lot of people , I loved the original ; `` American Graffiti '' was one of the greats of the mid-60s and one of the great American films. But like most things of that era, `` A.G. '' was only a movie with a lot of heart and a lot of promise that just got lost with time and then forgotten by people who were never to know the glory of `` G.I . Joe '' or the greatness of `` Top Gun '' . There are a lot of films I can say that I had a deep passion for but `` American Graffiti ''' was one.|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well I was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. I was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. They just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. I hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this Motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. And they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware Laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people..|1
"The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still ""bothered""."|1
The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about a young, beautiful woman (played by a young, beautiful actress) who is in love with a guy. He starts off explaining how his life has been completely changed by her. He decides he must find out the truth about her. This is when the story picks up and we see the director interviewing people who have had contact with the main character. There are people who have been friends with her who are now saying they don’t think she is the woman he is talking about.|0
This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. 'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland.|1
This movie , with all its complexity and subtlety , makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I’ve seen in quite a while . It’s certainly worth a look. The film is very well made – it’s one of the best that I’ve seen in awhile. I liked how it kept us engaged from start to finish. In fact, I don’t know if that’s ever been the case for a film. The only way I can describe it is that it was like watching a play.|0
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care?|1
"If I had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful I've seen it'd be this one. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. The movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either-I've seen depressing ""thriler"" type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. Vanishing didn't have that, This was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie."|1
"I'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie:#1 Angelina Jolie sex scene #2 Foley artist outdid themselves #3 plot was quite thick #4 DVD does includes trailers and chapter stops#5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie #6 homages to blade runner through out the film #7 burning trash cans #8 funny guy with no legs #9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the film. #10 Sage advise, for example ""When you dine with the devil bring a long spoon""."|1
"Unlike one of the reviewers below , I do n't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead of you if you write this kind of books. I hope you find a publisher, and I do hope that the author will find a publisher so that his/her career does not suffer, and so that we can enjoy the book as well. ""If you can, please, for all of us here, do your utmost to find a good home for your book(s), and don't be afraid of asking publishers to review your book(s) before you write."|0
"THE OTHER is a supposed `` horror '' movie made during the 1970s . It is not to be confused with the actual horror movie (made in 1972) called "" The Other "" . This movie is an attempt to tell the truth. It's supposed to be scary. This is the only way this movie makes sense . The plot of The Other starts in a bar where two men meet . One is talking to a girl and he is telling her that there is nothing wrong with this world that will ever change him ."|0
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles , death , mystery , and philosophy . In it 's third film, we find that all the answers are hidden inside the mind of the main protagonist. But will he discover all of them ? And what happens when the answers are revealed? You may not know this, but I’m a huge horror film buff. I go to movie theaters every month or two to see new movies, and I’ve seen every horror flick that was released since the year 2000.|0
"""Ghost Son"" is Lamberto Bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. It's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title."|1
"I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line ""I poked her with a stick. ""The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, dumb one."|1
Spoilers . This review has been edited due to word limit. ` The horror . The horror . ' Marlon Riggs' debut story in the series . Marlon Riggs . Marlon Riggs , who has been writing for more than thirty years, began writing horror for himself, first as a personal project before writing for professional markets and later for the genre. Riggs started as a teenager with horror short stories and poems, and he has published seventeen short stories and two novellas. These are included in the series, with more stories to follow over the course of the series.|0
This was a great movie . Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness that still exists in America. This movie made me think about my life and everything that goes on inside of it. I would like to see a sequel and maybe make a video talking about our lives here. It's not perfect, but we are moving on and trying to make a change in the U.S. and even the world. It was inspiring to see the young Black man in this movie and I hope we can all make a change like he did for a better world.|0
All right , let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64 . The graphics were very impressive, and that game was a huge influence on me getting into gaming. I played the original game as well as the sequel (which I never played) as well as a ton of SNES games in the early 2000s. The first time I saw the GBA version of the game, I was so excited that I didn't care about how bad the controls were. As someone who has tried a ton of handheld games over the years, this game was the epitome of a fun one.|0
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. We all agree it shouldn't have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. If you do end up going, don't take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family!|1
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? Only hope this is first and the last as well, for God's sake ! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. Why does Himesh not smile ?|1
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure.At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational.|1
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night . Frankly , I have never heard about this movie. When you see it , you must be amazed . What makes this movie such a big sensation is that it is a musical , which means you do not have to use your eyes . What you do need to watch is a good movie . It is not an everyday movie , so if you see it with a friend , you do need to sit there and chat . The movie opens with the following lines .|0
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete rubbish. There are many who will tell you that it is a masterpiece. In spite of this, the film is nothing more than a waste of film. I found it hard to sit through the first twenty minutes and would have been more than happy if the whole film just disappeared. This was not the type of film I would like to watch and it is disappointing to read that so many people seem to find it enjoyable.|0
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I seriously don't think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not.|1
I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast.|1
"The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. In fact the main character (Pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film I've even seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with ""Black Orpheus"") and have never forgotten it. I don't think I ever want to see it again--it was just too much."|1
Cheap , gloriously bad cheese from the 80 's , the decade of cheese . I watched this one first in the movie theaters , as an 8 or 9 year old kid, then again on television , and once on the internet . This movie is from the 90's , and I don't really know what the story is about , so I will leave it up to you to decide for yourself. I think you could probably make a very good movie from it , though I won't give you that much advice , because I am not a very good director .|0
"I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic , sexual , crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this film , but after seeing it I was so disappointed. I think the best word to describe this film would be ""disappointing "" because it was far too tame in almost every sense and the most disappointing aspect of this film is the lack of sexual interaction between the male lead and the female. I thought this was going to be an R-rated teen comedy. I was expecting a crude, sexual, teen comedy, but not one that takes itself too seriously, and this is what it really was."|0
I've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. When a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress playing Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it.|1
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull . I found myself disliking the characters and most of the characters were quite annoying and boring, but the plot and the overall plot was interesting . I do have to say that the film wasn't as much as it needed to be . It didn't really add up to anything new and I feel that most of the characters were pretty generic . If you have an active imagination there are some interesting ideas in the film but I personally feel that it needed more imagination .|0
"As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! As a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... ""Cely"" (my own last name).Originally titled ""Hostages"" this picture was changed to ""Another Son of Sam"" by the Producer-Director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time."|1
Watched this film at a local festival , the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. I saw it several times in the theatre . The film is based on a true story , which I will not tell you . I'll just say this , this was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The story was captivating . The performances were fantastic . The editing was brilliant . And the music was amazing . I don't know what I just said ! I have to say , if you see this film , don't just see it for the film .|0
"What I hoped for (or even expected) was the well known ""stop motion"" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. In short: The art of a) finding interesting Visual Events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. The stuff that made the other Qatsi's hits.I just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.Having watched the movie I got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping."|1
"I never saw Doctor Who before ( at least not in any focused way ) , so I was new to it all. However I had watched a couple of serials and they did not really grab my interest. However, after seeing an episode with the new showrunner Steven Moffat, I became hooked to the drama and I began watching the series. It is really amazing and I loved how the characters and the showrunner did not change and I would love to be a part of it

I would love to work in it."|0
For those viewers who thought the 1979 film `` Alien '' the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a sperm-transporting extraterrestrial, it turns out they were wrong. There has been a movie on this subject since the mid-1930s. Although it may be known as the most horrific of all horror movies, the 1931 German film `` The Vampyr '' is not just a horror movie, but a love story about a man and woman (Sigourney Weaver and Richard Greene) who fall in love while they are stranded on the planet Mars.|0
"To start with, I have done some further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. Secondly, This was a very low budget film, created in the Rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. The producers of Rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, ""surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop)."|1
Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed.|1
'Oldboy ' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most interesting films in recent years. The movie follows the lives of the rich and famous in Hong Kong during the 1980s (it was released in 1989) as they attempt to get away from their former lives and find new meaning and fulfillment in a world that never was quite what they expected. There are elements of 'Oldboy' in the film, but they are mostly confined to the very first 30 minutes or so.|0
Very enjoyable 50 's Western . I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature . It's a good movie , but I think there are better movies from that period . I have watched it in its original release and I agree that this movie shows a lot of potential. It is fun and I would recommend it highly. It has some good performances, but it is not perfect. In my opinion the story could have been better as well. It's an entertaining movie. It's not perfect, but it has a lot to offer.|0
Once again, I've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this one's not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile.|1
Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I 've ever bore witness too . It 's bad enough I wasted time watching the first season , now I wasted even more time because I thought this was supposed to be a series . I guess you can say this is the end of the road , and that's why I 'm still watching the show , I'm just waiting for the DVD to come . I 'm still hoping that this will be the end and this will be the end of one of our most beloved TV shows , but then again that 's just wishful thinking .|0
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before.|1
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. He's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick.|1

I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation.|1
This woman is a terrible comedian . She ca n't crack a joke . She has no real character . She can't act . And for a woman, that's just embarrassing . A woman with her head stuck up her anus with her butt cheeks hanging down is not attractive . That's why we have men and women for different reasons. Women are beautiful . It is men's role to take care of that beauty . A woman is a beautiful woman for men , not the man . A woman who looks like that is not attractive to men and can't act .|0
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody like Scary Movie.|1
"Thankfully you do n't need a lot of `` book learnin '' to understand where this thing 's going ... I want you to remember where this idea starts and I want you to use that as a guide to the rest of your life:

We are so connected to everything around us that our brains don't have to worry about the things we can't remember. Instead they can get on with what matters: the things they can still recall. ""So what do you want to do?"" I asked myself. ""What's important to you?"|0
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all the acting was done right. I was surprised that they could make a thriller film out of this story but I will say this the acting and the direction of the film were good and I enjoyed it. I thought the film was very good with its story line. I have seen this film so many times in the past year and it still keeps bringing me back. I was surprised when I found out that it is a remake of an older movie which was released way back when.|0
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards).|1

Also titled -- > The Magical Castle -- > This one is a stretch . Why bother ? Why create new worlds when one can simply create new characters with the new rules of magic ? The new characters are just there to create a new universe, and the old universe to which they belong . It's an easy solution, and one which has been in the works since the early '80s. New magic is the key to new worlds . If the world you're making has magic, you can take all the world's magic and turn it into a new world .|0
"So, this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It's up there with ""Crossbones"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares!"|1
I watched this movie on TCM last night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) about 18 years ago, it had to be better than ever! I had not seen it since. And it was amazing ! I can't say that I understood everything, but most of the things that the film made me understand had not come out in a long time. And I can now say that most of the things that had to come out in the film were important. I had never really understood why this movie was banned in some parts of the country.|0
Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood, and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 R D Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyricsEven if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.)|1
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy years, and not just a series of imagined stories told through the prism of an iconic American president. But the truth is there was only one version of the events that transpired. It is a version of events from which all the versions differ. The real history, as recounted by the Warren Commission, begins in the late summer and early fall of 1963. In November and December 1963, the FBI had learned of a plot by members of the so-called “Black Muslim Movement” to assassinate John F. Kennedy.|0
A snore gore. I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (Now the famous Crobar Night-club)on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three buddies and I laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. The theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. They didn't miss a darn thing. The Worst acting ever.These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema.|1
"I loved so much last Bellocchio 's movie , the masterpiece `` L'Ora di Religione '' . It had a huge star cast , with great supporting roles . It would be a dream to direct a film that has so many great actors ( in fact , many of those actors will probably be in this cast ) and then to have great support from so many other actors . And it's really not a hard task for me as a director . Now that I'm writing this blog I can see a lot of critics have said , "" I don't believe this man will do such a great movie."""|0
Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However, I think there is some other problems here.1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e.|1
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off.|1
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize CN. OK. Doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit.|1
As a serious marathoner , I was seriously disappointed in this film . Its target audience is clearly those who love running, and if they do, they have to be well read and trained , otherwise they wont stick with it . And once they get in the race , they wont go back . I wont be the first to admit it . But it took me a while to see the point in it . It has a decent story line with a couple of interesting subplots , most of which had no impact at all .|0
"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case . Judge and Jury are from the movie The Karate Kid. I would recommend this if your looking for a case that will take an average kid and teach him a lesson or two about learning to accept responsibility. This DVD case for the movie Karate Kid was used as a prop for the film. The case is about 12 x 12 inch and measures about 11"" deep. It has an acrylic top with a window and side door for the DVD player."|0
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. The two whom show up fall in love. The 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out. Okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together..slightly weird here...Harry Carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick.|1
Contains Major Spoilers , on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK , we have storms. They can't kill us. Well, they kill us , if we stay out too long. That's not a story line.That's how long we've been here. I have to go to get the next load of sandbags. No, I'm just saying the sandbags aren't that much use. I can't get ahold of the truck. The sandbags won't hold up for long. I'll see you at the beach , after the first storm.|0
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense has n't yet kicked in . We get a pretty solid first 20 minutes and it feels right to say that the film is better than the book. Even the plot is interesting, I can't really blame the book for that. The book had some issues and the movie just seems to fill in the blanks nicely. I do not know if I would say that the movie is better than the book, it just feels right. Overall, this movie is fantastic! The movie is a great movie. My only complaint?|0

**I N THE TWENTY-FOURTH YEAR OF _PORN_ ,** I was in high school, watching _Saturday Night Live._ As I recall, it was the week after John Belushi died.

"I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. It's not that I don't ""get it"" -- I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought ""Don't tell them, show them,"" then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.First of all, The Terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this."|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic , and I must admit that it whetted my appetite for it. There was a lot of good stuff in the trailer that got me interested in seeing the film on its own terms, and I was so taken with it that I decided to see the film. I had heard a lot of hype about the film beforehand, and the trailers left me with the sense that this could be one heck of a roller coaster ride. I don't know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't what I walked out of the theater with.|0
"What I got was something better.Just like many movies I've commented on as of recently, I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, ""Blue Spring"" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. I loved the trailer for ""9 Souls"", and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why.This movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else."|1
"This is one of the strangest things on TV . It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called The Blackpool. A few years ago, The Blackpool was known as a place where people got drunk and got laid on the beach. It is set in the fictional town of The Blackpool, which is about a mile from Liverpool, in the Blackpool and Mersey Canal District, and was first used on a regular basis in the season 2 of Channel 4's soap, Doctors. So, why did they name it that? ""Well, we know what the town was like."|0
Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience.|1
So well done. The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. It's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. It's the best performance that I've seen from Ms. Capshaw--she's been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.|1
"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be."|1
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down.|1
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films , only one was released by a major distributor . It was for his own company and it was one of the most critically successful and financially successful films made in Hollywood at that time . The picture was also the first by a major director to win Oscars . The Death of a Gunman (1980) stars Michael Douglas in a story of revenge and revenge itself, which is to be seen as a variation of the Gunman movie series from the previous decade .|0
To be honest, I did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I watched the last weeks. The first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual).|1
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe , challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and daring challenges as possible in as little time as possible.

Monday , October 02 , 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do . We ordered some stuff and I went back to the store to do some of the errands . I noticed a woman walking down the street and I walked over and asked her what was in store for her today . Her name was Gilda and my dad took me to her house . My dad told Gilda that he was in the grocery store and I told her about it . She said I should come over and I did .|0
"i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up. (got introduced to the doctor by way of John Pertwee)as well as ""camera copies"" of doctor who sent to America by UK fans to their US counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the CONs, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it."|1
"I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. While I was familiar with his better known compositions (""One is the Loneliest Number"", ""Without You""), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. If you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him."|1
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I 've ever experienced with a film . The acting is just horrible. It's ridiculous how bad they are in the movie and how they're trying to act like the best characters they've ever portrayed . I give the actors and the writer credit for how they do the acting , but that doesn't matter because I don't watch those movies . I can't imagine what the average viewer would think of them if they did the acting , since the movie has no plot , no explanation , and just a few characters .|0
Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view.|1
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand . I was intrigued for the first whole hour, I just wanted to keep watching it . Then the plot started to make sense , it did not make sense before , and now , I understand what is going on , it is very strange , but yet , it made sense. I would recommend watching this movie . There are many movies you can choose from on the internet , but some are better than the rest in the eyes of people who like them .|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me , raving about how well it was filmed , the underlying message in that recommendation was that I should see the film with a certain amount of seriousness . I did see this film, but not with the serious intention of getting something ‘right’ . I did, however, go into the film with the intent to get something wrong . When it came to the end , however , I was left with the feeling that there was a lot of potential for this story to explore the issues that so many of us are dealing with today .|0
I've never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid WWII historian, I don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean War bayonet lugs, K98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, German uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater.|1
"(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with ""Night of the Demons,"" but, you know, they're basically the same thing."|1
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable . It 's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the series finale . This is one of the only times that we get to see Diana, so she really should have been on set . The episode itself is a great showcase for the entire cast . There are also some great moments for Diana in this episode . Like when she says that she thinks she would have been the perfect partner for James . It is very sad that she has to say that , as she has always been the best person in her family and always wanted to marry him .|0
"I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ""Ethan Mao"" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I am going to give away a key element to the ""plot"".

Guess what? She calls the cops! Wow ... what a twist!"|1
"This is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word ""credit"" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman."|1
"Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). ""Liz"" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party."|1
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired.I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.Well done Alex Frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing.|1
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $ 5.00 . But since it featured 3 or 4 people who had not been on the air or had been killed or injured I figured it would be good and worth it. And it was good, very good. What made it better was the fact that it had the usual cast and crew so you could understand what they were doing with the material. The first part of the cast was very good, as it has been for years, but after that it seemed like there was only 1 person who was doing everything.|0
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River , near Shasta when this movie was being shot. It's one of the few films that I actually remember the cast, and the plot. The movie is very good, with a great cast of actors, and an incredible plot. I'll always remember it. It was the first movie I ever saw with my Dad. There were only two movies playing in theaters at the time, and even though the one in the theater wasn't as good as the one in the theater, my Dad loved this one more so.|0
"This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink ""I Never Got to Say Goodbye"", is the song come to life. You will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing."|1
"When a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of human garbage, destroy the world. And all we know for sure is that we are now going to have a short window of opportunity to make a deal. Friday, February 9, 2010

I have always believed that you can find anything you can look up in Google, and all of a sudden you have a treasure trove of knowledge at your command. It is true that the more you look for something, the more you will eventually find."|0
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic.|1
"If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up, I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out ""the reason"" and gets involved in ""the game"" by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a riddle fanatic, and also gets entangled in the game."|1
The series does not start as it means to go on. Although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. The first ever episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and Marina Sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. Seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually.|1
"Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo . Beautiful scenery , beautiful sets of people walking about on their way to and fro . And I get this feeling in my heart I can not quite explain . And I want to know the answer to my question . ” Why is everyone here on Earth , why do the people live here . Why do we exist . And why do they seem to look so alike ? “

Why do I exist , and why do I feel like I have lived a billion years ? Why did God create me and not another ?"|0
The sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so I went to the movies , and there was a guy in a red shirt sitting next to me , and he was asking for a dollar , and he had a book with him . So he gave me a dollar , which was about all he had , so I went back home , and he came to me . He asked if he could come upstairs to my room . When I got upstairs he asked me if I was his girlfriend , and I said yes , so he started asking me things .|0
The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously complex & at the same time quite simple. It should be clear what it is we are trying to accomplish by exposing these core issues at play, and it should also be apparent why some of these issues have come into view. As I’ve noted here in the past, there are few & far between clear-cut, black-or-white issues. What we have are a whole range of issues, with all kinds of shades of grey.|0
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to die in a movie at some point. I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to people who are curious about who dies and what their motives were.I really enjoyed the movie, but I didn't find it very scary so I can't say for certain that it was an effective movie to watch when you have a spider in your hands. What I enjoyed most about this movie was its setting in the early 20th century. The characters were interesting.|0
I saw this film when it premiered in LA . I think I laughed 2 or three times . The funny thing is that it is just a movie . I have no idea what is going to happen . At the time I felt like they had a good script and I thought they should have done a little more. I liked the director but thought he could do better. Now that I watch it again it is like the director and the actors are just trying to do the same thing they did the first time around . They had the script and that is what they do .|0
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film isn't anywhere near as funny.|1
This movie is about pathetic , spoiled , ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say , performed a lot of great things and still have their shit together and look like they do . there's a little of this in all of them , a little of that and some of that . there are some good moments , and some good dialogue , but there are also too many long speeches and too few action and too little of the comedy and too little drama . there are great moments , but it's hard to tell when they come from the movie or the actors .|0
I watched this mini in the early eighties . Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor . In fact I had the pleasure of working with him in the early 90s on the pilot of a show called “I Dream Of Jeannie.” . If you were a fan of Sam Waterson then you would know that he did “The Last of The Mohicans” . I didn’t know until I read this book , he had also been in a number of other films as well . I was amazed at his talent and what he was able to accomplish in his short career .|0
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and I had read two books - 'A Voyage for Madmen' and 'The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst' before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece.|1
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn't as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession.|1
If I had to pick the most depressing movie , try to be suspenseful I 've seen it 'd be the “The Sixth Sense ”. In it a man goes missing in the woods. When his wife tells his mother he 'd been killed in a car accident the mother refuses to believe him. She believes he went to prison. When her husband returns he tells his story and tells his mother and they have him committed. The woman has a hard time accepting the truth but is able to see it through his words.|0
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First off a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. Finally, It introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.A new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving.|1
The book is great . It 's one of my favorite books ever . The film , on the other hand , is just plain crap . If you don't like science fiction , this film is probably not for you . As for the books , they were not meant to be viewed by young people . There are many references to sex , drugs and horror . For a book, that has no redeeming value , it is just plain stupid . If you like the book , don't waste your money on the film .|0
"The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not? I am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries, ""Vietnam:The Ten Thousand Day War"", from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. I know America was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war."|1
I could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. The plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. Respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances.|1
"This movie 's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free , and that it was written and performed by a talented actor . . 1. THE HONEYMOON




. It was a Saturday night at the Honeymoon Cabaret & Lounge in Hollywood, California. The lights had come on and as I looked around the room, the room looked like it had been cleaned out and left a mess for the night to clean up and clean up some more. I looked around at the couples dancing with their arms all around each other and I smiled. . 2."|0
i was a huge fan of this series . Yesterday i watched it again on DVD . I was apprehensive to put it in my DVD player but after watching this , i must admit that it is really worth watching . It is my favorite movie in the whole series . What i mean to say i really liked this movie . I do not think that i would watch any other movie on DVD . For me , this is the only movie that i watch with all my friends . I do not think that this is a movie for the average people .|0
After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential.|1
This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I'd never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction.Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I'd fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't. She no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination.The movie has some cute moments.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor with several memorable turns, but his latest role is the kind of movie that has been out there for a long time, well before the era we're talking about: It's The Big Chill. The film, a low-rent remake of The Big Chill (1982), is about two friends and their awkward friendship. The film follows the friendship of two young men in a small Maine town in the early 1980s.|0
... but had to see just how bad it could get . The plotline was thin to begin with , so I figured I would see just how bad it could get . So , that's what I'm going to say . So , let's see . I think that this movie will end up being just a little too thin , because the characters aren't that memorable . First and foremost is that I don't care who this guy is . I really have no desire to know . It would be much better if I didn't get a glimpse of who he is .|0
"there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)""nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed."|1
"I've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled onto ""Cidade de Deus / City of God"". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER than ""City of God"".The acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of São Paulo.I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.Something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on."|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon , a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s ( although he's actually from the late 1800s). He's got all the advantages in life except a beautiful wife, and all he ever wants to do is go out and get rich. But when he goes to a fancy school, he meets a mysterious girl and they become fast friends. In fact, they're very close friends. And the more he gets to know his mysterious pal, the more he realizes the truth. He wants to get back to her, but it's not that simple.|0
"A antique shop-owner in NYC , played by Joanne Whalley ( Valerie Alston ) gets put on a US District Court jury in her quest to find out who was involved in an antique store burglary in order to help out the police department catch the culprits. When the US District Court jury is put on trial for a capital crime ( a murder ), the store owner finds herself in a difficult position as to what evidence to present, and how to plead her case if she gets the death penalty. Plot Summary

The plot of the story centers around Joanne Whalley, a small-town antique shop-owner in New York."|0
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about , however a copy of that first saw the light of day at a film festival where I had attended. After I had first heard of it I had to see it just to know what I was missing. It had to be said that Mr. Bug went to Town would probably have been the first movie to feature an actor with no lines in his own film (in fact he would have to be considered the inventor of the one and only spoken word in film history).|0
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing the story was great.i will definatly continue to read more stories in this line of books.i had a great time and i would highly recommend the book if you are a history buff or a lover of history to read it. the book was great, the characters, setting were great and the writing was good. i do recommend it. This sounds like something that should be read before you go to Scotland. I've only read a handful of books featuring the Tudor dynasty.|0
"`` Strike Force '' or `` The Librarians '' is a fun action movie that does n't it take itself too seriously. It follows a young man who becomes obsessed with a mysterious woman who he believes is an alien and who is able to change him into a lizard-like creature called a ""Librarian"" that has the power of reading minds. She's actually a young librarian who goes on the run with her brother, who's the town's chief librarian. The librarian is trying to protect her secret and figure out why her mind-reading ability seems to attract the bad guys."|0
"""Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters"" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it."|1
"LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean ""Tom Cruise"". Maverick means ""non-conformist"". ), is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport, Florida."|1
"This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of ""Do you need me/us now""? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie?"|1
You have to like baseball , and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck , but if you want to be a real fan , and not just a sucker for actors in baseball uniforms , and not just a fan of baseball , you need to know something about the sport. And the thing you must know is , if you're a fan of this game , it's not necessarily your favorite sport , it's probably not the most fun game to play , and maybe not even the most popular sport in the world .|0
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was I wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive other than they both take place on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.This movie will not hold most people's attention. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud.|1
"You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to Japan as his career winds down. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager (""Japan's Clint Eastwood""), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball."|1
Let 's face it , a truly awful movie , no ... I mean a `` truly '' awful movie , if it's not bad on so many levels , it's not bad at all , really , and I hate to have to admit this . I mean , if you're only thinking about the badness of this movie , I suppose it's not a very good movie . It's not a bad movie . It's just a very , very bad movie . As bad as the worst thing in the world . The worst movie , of all time .|0
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through , but how well do you think they did on this movie? i have to admit i am really surprised by this one. it seems to be a bit of a step back for this franchise. and for me at least, i think this was a very poor movie, and i do not think it should ever have been made. i mean come on.. what were you thinking of doing with a 3 year old?! I think you have it wrong.|0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of this movie it is clear that the writer of the screenplay, or whoever was responsible for the screenplay (it's a mystery how they could have written this, as it is completely ridiculous and has no sense of humor), has lost his/her mind and is simply playing a prank on the cast and crew of the show, or just the people who paid to see the movie, which is kind of like paying for your own suicide.|0
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners from 1950 to 1962. It wasn't easy at all to work on a series that didn't air in more than two or three weeks and had only one or two episodes. You didn't get paid anything until you had the first draft and you had to go to the network for a green light. Even then you might have to go through a second draft in a hurry to make it work or to get a better script if one of the writers suddenly disappeared.|0
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is a wonder beyond measure, but in this movie, it is not enough to be appreciated. You have to have the feeling that you have heard it before. You know it by heart—just as if your father had been in the movie. There is not a single scene of which I can say ""I've never seen that before"" or ""My father has played that role."" It is all too familiar."|0
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. Thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare I say....jolly good cinema. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood.|1
This movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain (the breather), a female Batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. Not by any means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing.|1
In general , I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I 'm afraid of everything for the first few minutes or two before I realize I'm being manipulated and that the story is there for my enjoyment as much as the other way around. I have been an avid horror fan since I was a wee lad. I've been to every horror movie ever made (and have seen every one in theaters) at least three times. I've seen everything from horror movies to horror films and have even seen some scary movies that were pretty good.|0
"my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! ""dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes"" and ""dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again."" what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality."|1
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS . Although he is quite grown up , it's easy to imagine how an eight-year-old's mind might have worked on it. At one time or another almost every kid in America has probably played CAPTIVE COWARD on the way to and from school. Maybe it's not so surprising that some of those who grew up in the United States have not seen their own country as an all-encompassing bastion against injustice. After all, there are people around the world who consider the United States the most racist society on the face of this earth.|0
That 's a weird , weird movie and does n't deserve a better mark than David Lynch 's one ! I can't see n't even watch the film ! I don't even have the DVD, and I've already bought it , so if there were a second DVD, I'd like to know where to put it , so that I can enjoy this film ! So you can help, please put it on DVD , so that I can buy it , and so that it will reach the people , who won't know how to go to this film !|0
"This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. ""The Stupids"" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great.In order to appreciate ""The Stupids"", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: ""I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime."""|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years . It’s not that the movie is bad . I just don’t know if I like it very much. When I look at this movie, I see it in a more positive way. I don’t have to analyze every moment. I can just enjoy the story, the look of the movie and the acting. The movie is actually one of the best in terms of visuals and music . The way it starts and the way it is filmed are some of the best ever in a movie.|0
This is a totally awesome movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler DDP would say; That's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women.|1
Very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. It is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. The first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something I've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it.|1
"This movie was astonishing how good it was ! The plot is extraordinary , and the acting spectacular . At times, I wished I could have a copy so I could watch it again and again ! This film is worth watching even if you dont like horror films . You will be pleasantly surprised how well the story is crafted . If you can get hold of the movie, do so and watch it ! I found this movie very interesting. I was a big fan of the movie ""The Fly"" and enjoyed it very much."|0
In Sweet Water , the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz ( Jim Storm ) is constructing a resort in the middle of the Amazon rainforest . He wants to be able to deliver the food he grows at his restaurant there to the villagers without ever having to step foot outside. When the villagers decide to move there anyway, they discover that they will never be able to return to civilization . What starts as a battle of wills between the two adversaries quickly turns into something else: a battle between the two tribes of man, with each tribe believing that the other one is about to be wiped off the earth.|0
When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry . It completely blew in my opinion . There were very few actors in the movie worth a second glance , I felt it was more about the director than the actor . There was not much character growth , but it was interesting to see how each actor got their part . Even with a bad script it was a great ride , but there was nothing unique about it . You can see the actors in the beginning of the movie and go with the flow for a good while .|0
What to say about this movie? A married couple has more then just each other. After playing around for some time things gets more serious. A difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. This movie seems to be very low budget. But a good story don't have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.|1
Honestly , I do n't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show . It embraces the tradition of the black american comic book and the fact that the characters are African-Americans. To many , this show is to be celebrated and to some it is nothing more than racist entertainment . Why do we have so many hate filled people who want to tear down anything and everything that is beautiful . Why do I hear so much negative comments ? Why is this show a must see ? I say to those who want to tear down this show. Do your research.|0
"Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu . I am going off on a tangent but I wanted to mention this and ask if you have any comments or questions. There are no weapons from Kung Fu, but it has a very interesting premise and a lot of interesting characters to play with. I'd like to share the following with you and it's a very simple game. Here are the rules:-

1. Game is played on a map, the player moves around the map to get a score of their choices."|0
Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise!!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy.|1
Take a bad script , some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? A film with a good concept that’s uninspired and lacking in talent. When the script is terrible, so is the script. ‘Black Mass’ is a horror/thriller/drama about a mobster (Joel Edgerton) who kills a witness to a crime and then murders a priest who is charged with his killing. The film’s director, Michael Caton-Jones (‘The Visitor’) is on board to produce the film in association with the Russo-British production house, Film4 Films.|0
****SPOILER ALERT**** My boyfriend, some friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We sort of knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints?|1
A young couple decides to runaway to sunny California. They never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the Rest Stop.After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. When she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you may ask?|1
"Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching ""Amilie"". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.The story is great and the ending is a bit funny."|1
"From the start of ""The Edge Of Love"", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance."|1
"This was a random rental at the video store . But I was impressed from the start . Wooden Camera was just what I need at the right price . I did a lot of looking before buying . It is well built and sturdy . The camera is also very well protected against the weather . Pros:
The camera was a gift . It came in very good condition. It has a quality lens . It is good to carry around in my purse. It took great pictures. Cons:
There is nothing I can complain about about the camera ."|0
"i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...""thing"" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get ""The Nun"".And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!"|1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this one out. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.In this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system.|1
The concept : show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together of their choice. The setting: an open house. The question: how diverse can we get. Why do we care? : because this is one more way of looking at the world. We are all connected, no matter where we live, what our race or religion or ethnicity or class or gender or sexuality or political beliefs or nationality or sexuality or gender, or nationality or sexuality, or religion or gender or nationality or sexuality.|0
"This movie is funny in more ways than one. It's got action. It's got humour. It's got attitude. It's got Dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! And that's just what the movie offers as a film. It's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some ""punches"" miss by feet. But when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those ""details""? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it..."|1
At first sight , I must say already , watch The Contractor , 2007 . With Wesley Snipes too . I must say that , although , the movie is too long , I had a good time . But I’m still disappointed with the plot of the story , and I hope that they can make it shorter . I have to confess that , after the movie , I have the desire to see The Contractor with Wesley Snipes again . Because , he is such a talented actor . I don’t know how , but I’ve had the desire to read a book .|0
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today!|1
"This film, also known as ""don't look in the basement"" is actually not bad. It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. I thought the acting , which seemed forced at first, somehow got better as the film went along. It seems like the actors really got into their roles."|1
This fantasy was utter garbage . I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies , but this was so far removed from any reality, I don't know that he could have pulled it off . I thought I'd make some notes and send the link to my brother and sister who I've had since they were born. I've never seen it and didn't see it . I really didn't care for it . I kept thinking it would be fun to watch . I liked the story and thought it was a very entertaining movie .|0
"Fulci ... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made ? Answer : yes ! And yes to the questions that will follow ! ""In the year 2000, four years after I had met you,"" said a strange looking man, ""there was this terrible war. I remember, when it was over, people were flying kites with little flags painted on them. And I found out that someone was making a film on it. I took out my camera and took a few shots. So I got it developed in a darkroom."|0
"Put simply, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest.This film can't even pass the ""Soap Opera for Dummies"" test. I'm sorry I have not read this award-winning novel, so I am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went."|1
Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I've had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance by the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.|1
"Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder ""Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?"" For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine ."|1
"I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale . In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially when they start fighting. So I decided to draw them. I'm going to upload the picture to my gallery tonight. I hope you'll like it! Thanks for visiting my art gallery ^^! I hope you will have as much fun here as I have doing this ^^! Please leave comments, I'm not going to read them! :'D

I loved this movie! Yes, it is rather cheap and I'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it.|1
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them. It basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. After viewing the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. IT'S NOT ENTERTAINING in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women.|1
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. Just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses.|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best. She's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992), by the way. However, there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For instance, in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. We also shouldn't forget mentioning Extramarital's three main actors.|1
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero.|1
"Back in the 70 's , a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F . Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent films under the name of D.W .. Griffith . But in reality, D.W . Griffith was already an established director with several movies to his credit . And he was just a teenager . So he didn't appear on the map in quite the same way his father had . On June 2, 1915 , one year before he died, D.W . Griffith shot what would later become one of the most famous movies of all time . """|0
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name.|1
"It 's painfully obvious that the people who made this `` movie '' have never seen such brilliant spoofs as those in "" Dumb & Dumber '' or "" Office Space,'' which are funny, but not nearly as brilliant as the original film, and that is exactly what you would expect when you go to the movies to watch such a movie. So it's no surprise that when you are watching it you don't see anything like that, and as you watch the scenes you begin to realize that all those funny jokes don't come close to being that funny."|0
It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally.|1
Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context.|1
This isn't exactly a complicated story. It's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. Claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. Those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. With Goya's Ghosts this doesn't apply.|1
'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different portrayals of the characters, but in this one, they are simply hopelessly in love.) The film is pretty slow-moving in some places, but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well.|1
An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one isn't like any other as it pits pint-size, wild-eyed, psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots.|1
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she was supposed to be a depressive, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more a depiction of a self-centered, worthless sh!tbag than a victim and survivor of depression.The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her. Sorry but I couldn't buy it. This is straight to video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.|1
Mute Witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there, a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film.|1

There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate and the first to be released. This title was originally published way back in the early 1950s in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories. This pulp magazine was not a typical pulp in that it did not focus solely on horror or horror fiction. It was more of a 'comedy' magazine. Amazing Stories had a wide variety of pulps, from western to romance, from science fiction to horror. In fact, their entire run was pulps.|0
The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful.|1
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing . The DVD cover looked pretty cool but when you put it into the VHS player the sound was distorted, the colours were poor (reds, yellows and blacks looked different from each other, the red was a bright red, it just didn’t have the same colour from shot to shot, and the blacks were pretty poor) and the resolution was low. If it wasn’t for the DVD cover the only things I would have cared about was how bad the sound was and the resolution.|0
This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The ending is so much the better for being untidy.|1
"Do n't get me wrong , I assumed this movie would be stupid , I honestly did , I gave it a big fat F.

But then again I was in my mid twenties and I had seen tons of crappy movies and I was still young and dumb . So I kept on watching this garbage and was surprised that I actually enjoyed the movie . I mean , there was a plot point here and there but the plot itself was so stupid and nonsensical it was actually very entertaining . I guess I am not that old ."|0
"(The beginning might be a spoiler...)""The Eye 2"" is the sequel to ""The Eye"". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. ""The Eye"" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas ""The Eye 2"" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit watching this."|1
This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim.|1
This movie is certainly well-constructed , beginning and ending in the dark , with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt , who , after being shot , is left lying on the ground , with a large amount of blood , the only person able to see her, is her mother , and in her hand , a note saying that she has committed suicide , and that she will haunt the movie for all time . . . However , there is something that makes the movie quite unique , at least to me , and I would like to point out it . . . .|0
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special. The acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.However, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles.|1
Go to the video store and get the original . I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to destroy the original. They already made a movie of the book. Do they really need to destroy the movie version? No one will care. They were already a blockbuster and the movie does not change the book. The book is a classic and Hollywood can't make a movie that does not make sense or change the book. The movie version is what people remember and that's what Hollywood wants. I read the book in school and I still love it.|0
"I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after ""Eraser."" ""End of Days,"" however, can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in. ""End of Days"" starts well with a gripping action sequence, yet quickly becomes a bore, taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read ""Doomsday""). Performances are stale, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful."|1
I, like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way  from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral  when it did occur. Nighy/Victor and Sheen/Lucian: Perfect. Now, what did not (and there is plenty).|1

Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging.There is, however, a flaw.|1
"Dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X.When it appears that a straight laced Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character.Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls? ""Naturally, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore so as to ruin him politically."|1
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home . it is still the first season and there is no way we can say we had enough time with every single character for this is a series and we need time with the main characters so we cannot just say we got it all . but I'm sure it will be better next time and we will not have the time with all the main characters that we did in the last season. There were many issues that made it more difficult to watch the first season.|0

This movie was so awful that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of trash. I couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. He doesn't just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. He even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything I have ever seen. I couldn't believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early '80's or something.|1
I saw this film many years ago , and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end, so I could tell everyone what I thought! It is one of my favorite films of all-time, and yet, even with the negative reviews I read back then I still thought it was a very good film. Now that I see this, I see it is a very flawed film. But, it was a very entertaining film in it's time! This is the film to go see if you don't have the time to get the other ones!|0
"I have for years remembered a song ""JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE"" (""No. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air""). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. I located a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 year old at the Ligonier PA theatre. I was pleased to find that it had Kenny Gardner the singer with Guy Lombaro (I am a Lombardo fan)."|1
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. The acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative.I would pay good money never, ever to see it again. Because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for anything really important.|1
"Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild , but I do think it had a lot to do with it. It was an old movie, and I was expecting it to be the new one. I was expecting the same story as last year, but the plot was very different. I was expecting to see someone I know die. That's not in this one. That's actually what made it different. And for the first time ever, I thought, ""I am going to have fun watching this movie with my kid."""|0
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old. I had half-day kindergarten and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. I, of course, stopped watching when I got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no VCR's or DVR's back then).|1
I am very impressed by the reviews I've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball.|1
WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started watching the movie, there were many plot holes that I did not find, and I was not able to fill in these plot holes as I did with the film's script. But when I finally started watching this film and looked at the characters' faces, I was able to fill in these plot holes. For those who have never seen the film, watch it as it is and do not try and fill in these plot holes for yourself.|0
I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war.|1
I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank's Place.|1

"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, ""Rainbow Connection,"" Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a ""rich and famous contract"" to entertain."|1
"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer.This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (""Pauline"") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. It's talk, talk, talk and more talk. For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless French morality play."|1
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" "" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" "" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO ."|1
"BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - ""MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE"") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ""ALL THAT"") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. As a matter of fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay erroneously ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo."|1
I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered the whole time through. I am not Asian but was still greatly offended by this film. The film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (Rex Harrison isn't even Asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention given to Biography of Anna. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner.|1
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She 's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid no mind to when writing her movie list. This is a movie I didn't care to watch because there was just something about the whole story that just did not fit with me. So, when the movie premiered in 2011 I thought about giving this a chance because the trailer looked promising. I saw it for the first time this weekend and can now honestly say it is a better movie than I ever could have imagined it could be.|0
Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame. Firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would turn up late on set, change the script, crew etc and generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his trouble enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this garbage.|1
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside . The inside should always be beautiful. I am glad she is here to teach them how to become strong women that can take care of their families. I have watched Tyra Banks in the past few weeks and she is a strong woman that knows how to deal with this and she did a great job . I love her so much and hope she can continue to be in this show and maybe be a strong woman like me when I was a little girl.|0
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.I often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics.|1
Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by Shag. The dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.).|1
If you liked the Grinch movie ... go watch that again , because this was no where near as good as that movie. So I guess we now know the answer to the riddle: it's not the Grinch, but us! What we're doing is far better than what we did for Christmas! The Grinch is a perfect illustration that our country has no clue what it's up against. We need to stand up for our rights and demand more from Congress, and from all other branches and officials, to do our jobs and make America great again.|0
I just saw this movie and all I can say is , where are the drive in 's these days, we need some! I agree, this movie was awesome. Not only was it funny and clever, but it is one of those movies that makes you think. However, there have been drive ins over here in Texas that were so bad, that I never went to them. I never went to a drive in theater because they were so bad, I figured the only way to go see a movie was to take the bus or take my mom with me.|0
"I was so ""impressed"" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try. It is the near future, post apocalypse of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. Oh my! Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is hardly up (or down) to HUNT's level."|1
Dire ! Dismal ! Awful ! Laughable ! Disappointing ! Right , your trapped in `` The Cave '' with no hope of coming out of this place in one piece . There's nothing to do for you . You could die of starvation , or get bitten by deadly insects . There is only one thing to do . Get out of here , and start a new life . You don't know what's in this cave , do you ? There might be gold and gems worth millions . Who would be crazy enough to go through such torture and hardship for such a worthless object ?|0
I tried watching this movie, but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part.|1
"It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie's ""real life."""|1
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories . Seeing the Muppets ( at the height of their popularity) on the big screen was more than special, it was breathtaking. I still watch them as often as I can, even to this day. This is one of my all-time favs. The plot of The Muppet Show revolves around Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy's attempts to have a baby. The story is interspersed with episodes from a variety show, The Electric Mayhem Show. It's about the Muppets having a kid!|0
"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date , and she thought it was an amusing way to introduce the first time she ever saw me . there's a reason they call it "" opening night ."" although it seems obvious that a scene like this isn't really about romance , there is actually some chemistry going on between two characters who have never met before . i'm a sucker for things like this , and can't believe the movie was made by john wayne just to make a movie with the same title as this one ."|0
Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies. They're all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of Mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. They can't stop it either.|1
Pacino , and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker . I swear , I am an avid movie critic , but I am starting to feel like an old codger at heart . This is a very poor movie with a very low quality score . It looks like an episode of The Golden Girls but it's much, much worse and so much worse . I have no desire to watch it . The worst part is the script . There is nothing remotely funny in this film . I will not even discuss the plot as that's a whole different level .|0
I was very disappointed in this film . The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors , but i don't care for this one . It has its moments , but i would not recommend this one . One of my friends saw it at a local movie house, and I had to see it for myself. I watched the whole film. I was quite surprised because it was better than I expected. The actors are pretty good, although the one in the lead role was supposed to be the most attractive one.|0
I do not find this show at all funny . I actually think it is much worse than any of the other comedy shows that are on the television. I am sorry but I don't think it is funny and neither does anyone else . The actors and actresses do a great job with their lines but I believe it is over rated. The show can not be watched on the big screen because its too loud . I feel that it is like watching bad comedy with bad jokes. It is a bad show and its time to take it off the air.|0
I have only praise for this film . From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim 's work. As a musical director Stephen was a genius . He is one of my favorites and I was very fortunate to have the chance to work with him as a choreographer in Chicago . This is a must have film and it deserves a huge amount of praise . It is very well made and a wonderful tribute to Stephen Sondheim . If you have the opportunity I would highly recommend seeing it . It's a must see .|0
"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her ""HOOKER"" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond."|1
There is only one reason this movie is watchable . Till Schweiger . He is such a good actor the movies like this are so boring . I am not going to talk about this movie . I have already said the same things in the comment section . The movie was good but this movie was not good . I am not going to waste my time talking . I think this is not the first time that this happened . You know why i am talking so much . Because that is what is the reason behind all the comments . I don't know .|0
Ah! When good actors take on bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialog is just plain silly.But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will LOVE this movie!|1
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I 've ever viewed . So annoyed I even complained to my cable company and even they didn't care about it either. I would have put it on the blacklist but the only one who cares is my mother. So, that's how I have it now . I hope you will keep posting as well . And I hope no one would ever find out you have posted something that has such bad taste and you could have easily been arrested for hate speech .|0
This movie baffled me . I could not get a grip on it . Thought I might be missing something , but after a while I realized I was not missing anything . The plot was very strange . It was interesting because I could see where this movie was going with the film and it was not the same as the book . It was good , but I could not understand what was going on . There was a good story line and there was even a good ending , but I do not agree with the moral of the movie . The movie was good , but that moral was wrong.|0
"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece."|1
One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with `` Only for big fans of the lead actors or the main characters, I suppose.'' It does make sense. But for most people, this is a good movie. For example, it has been a couple of years since I read the book, which I thought was pretty good. But after I read the book and seen the movie, I realized that while there were elements of the book in it, they were much more subtle in the movie, because it was made by a major Hollywood studio.|0
being a fan of Bela Lugosi,Boris Karloff,and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of Lugosi,Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad.|1
"Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. ""K2"" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing."|1
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top V.I.P employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible.|1
When I first saw this movie, I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector(masterfully played by Elijah Wood)who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII. He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20-something, club hitting translator and his grandfather.|1
Watched this film at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. A simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot.The film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.|1
It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks, but finally, it did! On Friday, March 25, it was finally announced that Hulu will be available to stream in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. As the world’s largest streamer of TV shows and movies, Hulu will now stream the film series The Walking Dead and a new series based on King’s iconic horror novel and graphic novel series, Pet Sematary, as well as his short stories.|0
"Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and ""heavy on the bottle"" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters)."|1
The acting is awkward and creepy , and not in a good way ... at all . The writing , though very well acted , is very flat and uninspired. In fact , it could use some re-write . It is not bad by any stretch . It just needs to move from being a well acted , well scripted movie with some interesting moments to one that is not bad and a good watch . I liked this one more than I expected to , but I would have liked to have been treated to a good action movie , rather than a boring action movie .|0
If this movie would have been in English , all critics would have trashed it . The language is extremely poor . It is very boring and over-acted . The only things that really stand out are the music , and a small cameo by Mickey Rourke as the main villain. The plot is very predictable , but the acting and cinematography are not the greatest. Overall this is a very poor movie that will leave you feeling like you’ve just woken up from a bad dream. There is not much to recommend about this movie other than the casting of Mickey Rourke .|0
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses.|1
OK , this movie was n't good at all . Video games are n't what I would brag on if i were a kid . Video games is n't good at all . Why would someone spend $10 on a game when the only one who ever wins the lottery is an idiot. So what is the point of gamings? Why is this a good way of entertainment? I do not understand it at all . What is the fun in that? I think we have better things to use our money on , such as going to school .|0
I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to.|1
Okay , I love this movie ! ! ! ! ! I watched it over and over again . It was one of the best movies in the 90's . And it is one of the top movies of all times . Great movie . You will love this movie ! ! ! There have been so many movies that have come out in past few years. But this movie is the best of all movies. It has a great story that will give you goose bumps when you have watched it. It has loads of action and fun.|0
This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust . If it were n't for the needless animal killing in it and the use of poor actors (who don't have to play the animals) it would make more sense as a comedy but as a horror film it just isn't scary enough . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the past year or so a few of us have become obsessed with a certain filmmaker who we've been following since the early days of cinema and who is now working in video production.|0
(This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever.|1
I can't believe I sat through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUPPOSED to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't. The only saving grace is that it was on cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.|1
I looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. There is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. Zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. I was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! .............Don't expect anything from this movie.|1
This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audience. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average.Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. All through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding.|1
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales . . . but not in a bad way, they just seem to have stopped bothering with the whole bus thing for a bit . . . until now . . . The Three Musketeers? I’m guessing this one’s not too far from the mark – or at least that’s where the inspiration came from – but I did find it strangely satisfying, if a bit too easy to imagine as a movie.|0
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow. I would not think about going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn french anyhow because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I rather go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language just like me. Therefore I will not bother the France trip no matter what.|1
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their young son. The couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind. Upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous, tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza .|1
I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat.|1
I wo n't bore you with any synopsis , chances are you already know them . And hopefully you are not here to ask the same question of another member who has a different answer . So to make things interesting , lets start with the good ones and move on to bad ones . To begin , first of all , I must admit that it took a while to get to the right answer , and even more to come to it. There were so many things I could have picked that would have made a better answer , but I couldn't really think of any of them .|0

Travelling down the Thames: Part Two

It took us about 3 hours to get from Waterloo to Ebury St. This was the closest we had yet been to central London and by that I mean the area we were visiting is pretty central by UK standards, at least it wasn't the suburbs we were visiting. It was good to be back at Waterloo again."|0
"""No one really knows how the Power came to be. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted The families of Ipswich formed a Covenant of Silence bla bla bla"" After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't."|1
"My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: ""If I were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I couldn't imagine Hell being any worse. Jim Varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). Now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a Varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. Not a laugh. Not one."|1
Now, I like the Bollywood films and I'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish.The idea of a modern-Bollywood take on Amadeus was quite an exciting one, that is until the two supposed 'musicians' appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man, and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities, but he is never once believable as a modern Mozart.|1
'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. Alas, as I watched it alone, and so I felt like I almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'Thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries.|1
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it.|1
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, Don (William Hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish.|1
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart : I would say this is certainly the best book I have ever read in my whole life. I have not read many books written by a male author but this was one I couldn’t stop thinking about for hours. The author really made me feel like I was a part of this family. I felt such a strong connection to the characters. This book is so beautifully written. The characters will stay with me forever : the plot and story line is amazing.|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that . It was about this guy who gets a curse put on him that he can never ever have sex with women. He meets this girl who is super hot but she can't handle his size so they go to the bar and she has a crush on his best friend . I don't like horror films but I love this one .I mean this is a horror film . The story is that there are ghosts in this town . and there is this old man .|0
An obvious cash-in on the * Insert Monster Here * On A Plane gimmick , Flight Of The Living Dead is not an original piece of genre-busting cinema. But in terms of zombie movie shock and awe, it is as good as or better than many of the genre’s own. While the plot is familiar, the execution of it is not. To begin with, the title character is not dead, but very close. This is not the kind of plot you would expect in a Zombie movie. But then the movie itself is not a traditional zombie flick; it’s more a retelling of Frankenstein.|0
I 'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair , but the female villain in this movie had it BIG with a huge pony tail. Not the style I would be comfortable in so I turned my head to the side to avoid getting caught up in the pony . When I turned my head and looked back, the villain was sitting on the floor with the head of her pony stuck in a crack in the concrete floor. I thought I'd just go with it and go with the flow as long as I could still look cool.|0
"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? ""Who?"" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off."|1
The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love.|1
I 've seen all 3 now . I just ca n't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is . Not in comparison to these other films , but to some degree . It just takes a little longer to get to know the main character , but the story is better and there is a lot more action . Plus the characters are much more developed . It was great for me because I had to see it twice . It is a good movie for those who like these types of movies . Just a great film . I really recommend this to all fans of these types of films .|0
"This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, ""Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?"" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo."|1
From the makers of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a BIG deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). A twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named Vivian is currently residing in Romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in America for being werewolves.|1
This movie was sooo bad. It wasn't even funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse.

I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of `` Grand Champion '' and had the honor of working with some of the most talented people on the planet, from the directors to the production designers to the costume people to the still photographers. We were truly blessed, but I can tell you it was a great time for the photographers too. The film was shot over several months at locations around the world. At the beginning of the process, I was told they were looking for a photographer to capture the movie `` Grand Champion '.''|0
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now , but having just sat down to write one today, my heart has been filled with a mixture of gratitude to the owners and their family , and also with fear for my safety on the island . A friend who visited recently asked what the island was like for a young girl. She was intrigued to learn that the island is a holiday home for a number of young girls. She also asked if I could take her there. The answer was simple , she had never been to a girls holiday before.|0
Actually I'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some folks will expect it anyway. First let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... To the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please.|1
"For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. This is a disjointed ""Cliff Notes"" version of Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching.Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book? The one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench."|1
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice.|1
"This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the rights of the individual to pursue his own ends. For those of us who are anti-state, we can learn a lot from this. This also explains why the public and its representatives can have no real say over corporate activities, as they are just tools used to implement the will of the companies. I have always liked this article, even though I have written my own response here: http://www.greenspiritblog.com/?s=johnson+davis
I think there is no way that the current system could work without corporate money."|0
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. And trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.|1
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV , try watching it on YouTube. In case you haven’t already checked it out , you may check it out here on this link – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0l5KGw9KZ0. We have already made it clear that when a film is made , it is made by a person , and it is up to them to decide , how it should be released and what should be added to the film. In the recent past , this is how the film was released.|0
Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this film? It is pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed for Yash Raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.This is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie I have ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do.|1
I 'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie . . . but then, I was very happy he was able to make the movie in his own way. This movie was so much of a labor of love that you can see it as if it's a personal movie. I've said on the web that Zack Allan is the only artist I really look up to these days. I think he's on the right track and I've been following the work he does since the early 1990s when I discovered him.|0
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long . The time is Thanksgiving of 1972, just weeks before a massive war began. The war continues to this day, more than 10 years after the end of hostilities in Vietnam . The United States began its invasion and occupation of Iraq by invading Afghanistan (then under the control of the Mujaheddin of the mujahadeen) in February of 2001. It was a war for oil, a war to control the oil-rich lands of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region.|0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through.|1
"I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounded intriguing!! This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The ""monsters"" needed more face time. We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more ""Oh Sh--"" moments. The photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. There were too many close ups. But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers."|1
Like the previous two 'Mad Max ' films , 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ' is not exception to the violence and carnage in the 'Mad Max ' canon , but it is one of the films that has been overlooked by many critics, fans of the series , and even by 'Mad Max' creator George A. Romero . The film is based on a novel called 'The Road Warrior' by A.D. Coleman . This is an interesting choice for the filmmakers , as Coleman is also the author of one of George Romero's earliest published novels . Coleman's novel is in fact a novelization of George A. Romero 's first two films .|0
if u have n't seen Vijay in `` Ghillli '' , `` Gilly '' or `` Ghillie '' . go on see him. he is quite a decent fellow . he was the only man who used to bring his own booze to our college parties. i know this is not the right thing to do but i do not feel too bad about the fact that he used to bring booze to ours and the other college parties. you will not get a girl in the college to do all this. i do not wish to discuss this issue further.|0
I was duped as well. Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get.An hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.I thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.Damn I was sooooo wrong. It was very hard to watch the whole thing.Don't fool yourself. Its not so good that its bad. Its not even that kind of movie.Its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!|1
Ostensibly, Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. And despite the complex portrayal--Hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims--the above must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking as well (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may look no further than Hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion.|1
"Well , I fear that my review of this special wo n't heed much different observation than the others before, so I will just leave the review here

I'd say this game is quite well designed, but when it comes down to it, it's not very fun or very interesting. Let's start with the ""fun"" first. I'll start off by saying that this is a very hard game to beat. I mean, there are tons of levels and tons of enemies, plus a huge amount of them, so it's definitely not one of the easy games out there."|0
As the title suggests there is a philosophical , meritocratic thread running through this film : if a man has an intellect , he can do anything he wants to . But what does this mean ? It is not enough to be able to read, write and calculate. It is also necessary that you can think, to analyse things logically and solve problems . In a way, this is the essence of rationality, and what distinguishes a human being from all other animals. To be capable of thinking , we need to have free will and this is the only way for humanity to progress in this world.|0
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences.|1
Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders.|1
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement.|1
* some possible spoilers * Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original. That is not to say, that the original film is bad and this film is great, it could not be any better. What I mean is, there were a few films I did not like and I think it is hard to be able to like it, but I enjoyed it. But, when I watched it a few years later it was like someone took a piece of me and ripped it out.|0
"I saw this at my in-laws ' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said ""why do they want to watch it on television?"" and I said, ""Because it looks cool! "" ""But what good is it?"" she asked. ""Because you don't have to get up and go and use the TV"" said I. I have seen the film on DVD several times. Very interesting. I have also read a book by Tom Wolfe on this movie. He talks about why he liked it so much and it was not because they made it look great."|0
Although I saw this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. From what I can make of it, this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers.|1
A group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. They each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself.This not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie.|1
A remake can be successful . An adaptation can be successful . It is n't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation that is successful. In other words, remakes fail. When it comes to remakes, there have been many successful ones, and they are few. Remakes have not been a thing in the entertainment industry since the mid-nineties or even earlier. In fact, there have been just as many successful adaptations of films made in the same genre, but with a different cast, in the past couple of decades. There have also been a lot of failures.|0
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter.|1
"Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this ""world premiere."" What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production."|1
There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this . It was painful to watch , but strangely enough, we were all enjoying it , and some were even singing along. I had a feeling that I wasn't actually watching it on TV or on the Internet , but actually going through the process. It was very bizarre. It's a shame that no one else noticed or cared. I do know it was on YouTube . The video has since disappeared, so maybe they will bring it back or get it removed .|0
"Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oPThis movie is ""D"" quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997."|1
Jess Franco makes exploitation films , and he has made tons of them . Franco is responsible for some of the most popular films of his generation , like The Untold Story of the Kennedy Assassination ( 2004 ) and Franco's Way ( 2009 ). These are films about real events , and he knows how to tell stories that make you sit up and take notice . So you can see that Franco has a real talent for storytelling , and his career started off with small roles in exploitation films before moving on to bigger and better things like directing and producing.|0
... means `` take up and read '' , which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this movie. So it is not entirely a spoiler. The movie is actually quite a bit better than it is being advertised to be. The plot is interesting and there are some good moments of drama. But in general, this is just not what the hype made it seem. I thought that the plot was good but the acting at times felt forced. I'm glad the movie was not over done.|0
Probably because this is Columbia 's first film in color , the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. In general, the colors are very strong, which makes you feel comfortable. Columbia 's second film with English actor Richard Griffiths is a drama of a boy and girl who live in the past . The story is not that great, the music and special effects are average, and the acting is not great as well . In the movie 's setting , there are many references to American movies , so in the end, the movie does not feel like American cinema .|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a PG-13. Even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. The only mildly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, going a bit Goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic.|1
"The thing which makes `` Fire '' even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry , is its sheer entertainment value. This is the only anime series that you will be able to call your personal ""must see"" anime . You can watch this show any time and you will get a good amount of entertainment . It is a perfect series to binge watch and you'll probably watch it for at least 6 months. I highly recommend you should check out this series . If you love anime and you are tired of the same shows everyday , then I recommend you to give this show a shot."|0
"RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955)To me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a Hollywood-remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business... How they're gonna pull this off?Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and went on to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some ""The Grandddady of all caper- and heist movies""."|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. The stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. But then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. This movie ranks just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling.|1
My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound.|1
"I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg 's . I saw this movie with my mom , and it was hilarious . In the movie , there's this scene where Mark plays Rock Star and his friends in a video game in front of his parents . Mark's mom is very confused , and she tries to explain it , and she ends up yelling at him , and Mark's dad laughs at her , she gets mad and screams at him to "" shut up .

The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito. The series' star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think, if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor).|1
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots.|1
It seems to be a common thing in the 90 's to play with cliches . Some manage to do something different, some do not. Now, as we know from this blog, I don't really care about cliches. I'm a realist, if that is the case. However, we do know a lot of these cliches have been made popular because they were catchy, because they are catchy or because they were popular when the writer was a kid. We know that cliche's can and have been abused.|0
I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.Grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. I am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.It ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.|1
Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.Presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. This sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. Don't go out of your way to see it.|1
I 'm sorry but I ca n't agree that this was a good movie . Yes , it looked good on the screen but in my opinion , it was bad . I think that this movie was very poor , especially for the first time in hollywood . I don't know about other films but this one didn 't make any sense and there were a lot of things that wasn't believable . And for the first one in this list , I liked the last scene . The only one that wasn't perfect was the last scene of the last movie .|0
Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. Actually it sort of stinks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. Characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good.|1
"I 'm glad they finally released it on DVD . I bought the video tape years ago and watch it a couple of times a month. I've got the DVD on my shelf just in case.

A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast. Not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. Just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. Not one of director Roger Corman's best.|1
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I decided to go ahead and get the movie in the hopes that I would like it because it had such an amazing cover. Now I’m not usually a huge horror movie fan, but the cover and the tagline that was on it intrigued me and made me want the movie. What are your thoughts about this review? If you have watched this movie, I’d love to hear your thoughts.|0
"Okay , so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern times . that would make a great summer movie . why would he remake a classic movie ? his reasons : 
1 . the original was an homage to Robert Bloch , 
an old silent movie director who came out of the silent movies in the 1930s in the early days of films being made in color . so he decided to put his own twist on his version of the story , 
and he changed the story to be a classic film noir ."|0
Young writers , young auteur , young cast , busload of producers , what could go wrong ? Everything . So we’ve been asked to be a part of a film for one of the top directors in Hollywood , and what does that have to do with what I write here on the blog ? Well, we were asked to make a small film for a very important and interesting director , one who has been very generous in allowing me to post my work for free on this blog. This director is also a friend , and I have had the opportunity to make two films with him so far.|0

I think I know why I'm drawn to you, I'll explain. You say you want a friend. That you want to be friends. I want that, too. But not like you do. What did you expect? Nothing.

Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish.|1
So bad , it 's entertaining , especially during cocktail hour , and believe me , you 'll need a couple for the show . You just have to get the right combination to make it work . And of course , you have to ask yourself , what else could I do with these ? If you have the space , you could do it all at the same time . Of course , this is a great way to have a drink , while watching . The best of all is when a couple is in the room .|0
"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that."|1
This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie 's work , a lifeless , muddled mystery with very little of the wit or charm of the master storyteller, but a lot of the things which make the work so interesting are still here. As for the plot , I'll leave it to your own imagination ; there's a good chance that it'll involve a murder of some sort , or maybe a murder mystery, but if it doesn't then it will involve some sort of murder at some point in the future.|0
Mikio Naruse 's examination of the lives of three idling , constantly complaining , single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is an excellent and moving book. The story is based on the lives of three individuals who have the misfortune to have been forced to stay in their own company (one as an ex-geisha and the other two in prison) for two years because they couldn’t find a decent job in Japan. I’ve never seen this kind of situation before but I understand their plight: it seems that a lot of ex-geishas end up staying single.|0
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the French ruling Spain. The movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So, the movie gets confusing then. The movie begins when Ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judiasm by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put to the Question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison.|1
"Something not-so-great. ""Silence of the Lambs"" remains Demme's only good film, and I'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which I haven't seen - and never will.This is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. The first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. His animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny."|1
It 's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS : RED without mentioning my most recent discovery. In the last few weeks of the year, I have discovered something completely unique, yet I am not entirely sure I should even call it new. It is that, when I say 'new' I really do mean something new. For the past three months, I have been exploring something that I have not explored for decades, in fact for thousands of years. That's right.|0
"The movie is nothing extraordinary. As a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...It's just another case of ""another teenage horror movie""-seen one and you've seen em all. First few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. The worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. Would have been better if it's written in Spanish."|1
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference.|1
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in Aberdeen.1st off Im not a big Sci-Fi fan (baring Star Wars) I was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, I was presently surprised.|1
This is such a fun and funny movie . Highly entertaining at all angles . It features an outlandish array of absurd characters and a love story that is touching at its core and heart. The script is superb . The actors are excellent too. There have been numerous movies with love stories like these in recent years, but this is one that stands out from the pack. With its unique style, this is also a must see . The humor is great . The script has some good jokes . You will love it . The movie will make you laugh .|0
I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know , those hip , modern, very chic clubs with great music and dance . you know the sort . well , this movie isn't in the same league. it's actually a comedy that's about a man who gets hired to fix up a club that is scheduled to be destroyed by fire, and it's only a question of when he's going to be done doing it . the movie , of course , is narrated by the man who's going to be fixing it up .|0
"I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. There was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original ""Lone ranger"", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing at children's hospitals as the Lone ranger for sick kids.) To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger."|1
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another ? GIANT cgi versions of these two characters or the two characters playing themselves against one another on the stage. I have a feeling that in this one, these two will come up for a duel and if the other wins, it’s not even the battle. It’s the fight that is going on between them and the other characters. I hope this film is a good one with a lot of humour in it. I can see a movie like this coming up on Netflix sometime soon.|0
What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow .|1
This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work , whose writing is amazing . Sadly , this movie never got its due , and it is not so good in my opinion , as it should be . I feel , it has more of a mystery element in the story and not that of a mystery film . The story is predictable , but has a few good lines . The acting is good too , and there were quite a few funny lines . The movie is not perfect . There are a couple of moments where I was annoyed with the pace of the movie as well .|0
Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce 's assassin Shax . While Piper is away, Dr. Griffiths meets with a young woman who says she works for Shax. Later, he goes to Dr. Shax's home where he is confronted by a young man who tells him to find Piper, not Shax. Piper arrives and tells Dr. Griffiths that she will find Shax for him, but at the end of the book, she is seen leaving with a young man she meets at the end of the book.|0
This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on . But , I 'd just could n't find it . Then one day I 'd just read on the web that there were two shows . I 'd tried them out and after a couple days I 'd finally given them a chance . I found them very enjoyable . I was hooked after the second day . The show was about the relationship between a writer and a publisher . They both wanted to write . But one had a book to write first . The other had a contract with the publishers and he had to finish before the next writer .|0
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival . The Beagle 's only in a couple of minutes but was very well done , very educational in the sense that you could actually see what is going on without understanding too much , and I think this was the first time I had watched it in the cinema . Very educational about what is going on . An excellent documentary with an excellent cast. A great deal of fun. Well worth a look if you've got a few minutes. It is very interesting , and the film is very educational .|0
As I write this in November 2005 I've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results Romantic comedies .|1
Jennifer Montgomery 's `` Art for Teachers of Children '' is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . Montgomery 's gritty story of a young black woman , her troubled relationship with her father, and the emotional and physical abuse she suffers at his hands , has been widely acclaimed and has brought a whole new level of empathy to how we think about violence in our communities . In the year after the release of the film, a number of African-American adults who were victims of domestic violence shared their stories with Montgomery to show that the issue is far from a black problem that only black people suffer from .|0
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night . I 'm 20 years old and this movie was pretty intense to me . I wasn 't really interested in the movie when it first came out but then I read a lot of reviews about it and I found that I liked it a lot . There was a point in the movie where I could feel my heart breaking and I felt sad and then at another point in the movie I was just laughing so hard that I had tears running down my face .|0
I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and when I did realize I thought to myself, I can't believe it's in theaters in January! - but it was so much fun and I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I saw it and was able to enjoy the experience as well!I have to say, I didn't know how much fun this movie would be.The acting was great, the performances by the cast were great, the story was well-written and the acting was great from the whole cast - the same with the supporting cast.|0
"Oh, my. Oh, this is a *really* bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.What does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. ""Oh, s/he died? Huh... Figured they would"" was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who."|1
"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive."|1
"I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on back about ""an overzealous, evangelical Christian do-gooder,"" and identifying as an evangelical Christian, myself, I thought, ""Ooohthis should be interesting."" And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough, all too familiar."|1
Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it.|1
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick . And of course they do their best to change the story. I'm going to give them a chance. This may not be my best effort. This is very rough and ready. This is a movie for people who have never been a victim. I think the movie could be much better, but I think they do a good job with this film . I like the plot twists. The main characters are decent. Overall, this isn't the worst, but the story is very weak.|0
"There's only 2 reasons I watch this show...I invested the time already in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you supposed Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is ""who is the fifth cylon"". Poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development."|1
"A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. Nicknamed ""Good Time Charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's Lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact."|1
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Hans Keller - I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it.|1
"""Mr. Bug Goes To Town"" was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with assistance by Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White for Disney. Harline's ""atmospheric music"" is superb, and a treat for the ears.The layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the Fleischer's background artists outdid themselves."|1
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That's reason enough for me.She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. And said parties becoming drunken orgies.All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. And Emanuelle beds most of them.Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this one. He just ripped it off and used the same cast(s).|1
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race , a killer begins to murder the rest of the Olympian family . The investigation takes a disturbing turn when an old high school friend who is also an athlete is found murdered , apparently killed by the same person. As the family's innocence becomes an issue , it becomes clear that the killer must be someone close to the Olympian's family. Now, with the killer on the loose , a small-town family will go to all lengths to get to him, and will discover that they are in much more danger than they thought.|0
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell 's book tour . I thought it was amazing . Almost everything I've ever told anyone is coming back . . . except the time I went on vacation and forgot about it. But I'm not the type that will let that happen, so that's why it's here . In case you haven’t heard, there are three episodes of the cult TV show Star Trek: Enterprise, each one of them available on VHS in the summer of 2004 and on DVD in 2006.|0
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. The quality was so pitiful that I couldn't stand watching it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like Chris Hegedus.|1
"This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps? ), attacking model trains and toy cars. The ""science"" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? And what's up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from ""some god-forsaken anti-matter universe"", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in New York."|1
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie 's not even over yet . In fact , I can't believe that the movie is over already. I don't think that this is going to go down well at all. I'm just going to start by talking about the movie and the actors who play the leads. The movie is good for what it is. I mean , it's good . Its a bit on the average side , but then again , that is what we get when you see an average movie, right .|0
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home ? How does it get on the DVD when I'm playing it and what the hell is that ? I'm seriously wondering what could possibly be on it since it's not there when I put it in there . I've just bought a couple of DVDs and the DVD player doesn't open them anymore. Can't access the menu and so on. I've had this since I started using DVD's about 2 months ago. I've tried different DVD discs, different DVD drive, trying different USB drives.|0
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose ( http : //imdb.com/title/tt0119590/ ) . The new movie has the cast and plot unchanged. The difference between this movie and the old one is that the director has given the movie more life. There are more interesting and well-written characters. There is a better plot. It is far superior to the version we have in our theaters. In this movie there are three main characters who are very different from one another and not only physically but also psychologically. The director has made his own choices in the story.|0
As a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge Jane Austen fan , I was always looking for new TV projects that would have a nod to one of the great authors of our time. The recent announcement of the upcoming Netflix Original series Sense8 from Star Trek: Discovery executive producer Alex Kurtzman makes me particularly hopeful for the show. But with Sense8, which focuses on eight extraordinary people who have psychic abilities that have been used as weapons against one another since the earliest years of human history, I think there are even more potential for this type of series.|0
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was a pretty good movie and one of the best movies of the year. But I think that the problem was that it was directed by Michael Mann who used to be one of the biggest movie makers of our time until he went mad and made some pretty terrible movies. But the movie was very boring and had some great scenes that I didn’t like but overall i thought it was a pretty good movie.|0
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age , with the Romans , Vikings , and Celts to follow. This is probably not quite true and it probably doesn’t really reflect reality. I decided to try to reconstruct the history of Ireland, starting in 941 AD with the Viking raids on Ulster and the arrival of the Vikings, then going through the Norman conquest and the arrival of the Normans. This would give us the beginnings of the island, a history that would have a lot to say about the Vikings, the Vikings, the Irish, and the Irish.|0
I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great, very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep, he wrote it in 2:45.|1
First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie. 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven.|1
"""Delusion"" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. The film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's B-movie diva Rubin's even performance. Don't waste your time on this turkey."|1
Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD.|1
I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit.|1
I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost nonstop until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I was left speechless.Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside.|1
Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies , this one stinks . The usual gaggle of oversexed teens and the teenage girl who's the center of the action are here but what really makes this film a bad flick is the fact that the horror genre has evolved so well since the early 80's and we have a glut of horror movies on DVD now but when you're on a tight budget and have little or no marketing budget , making a quality horror flick can be a challenge . I don't feel this movie is nearly as bad as other movies that have come out in recent years .|0
"`` Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s . A brilliant piece of work. I can't recommend it enough. It makes me feel ashamed that we've forgotten so much of what we were made up as, but I'm sure you'll be proud that you're not what we are. You've never let that happen. And we love you. Monday, May 14, 2011

I know, this is not even a year old. You're probably wondering how this is possible considering that it's been less than a year since we moved here."|0
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film. On its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets who would like to look out for him. Nothing overly interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when Carrie is murdered.|1
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo-like madness.The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken.|1
I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol' Blue Eyes. However, I've never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing. Well...it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine, who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band.|1
Low budget mystery. A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan(Chick Chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. The woman in a hurry, Mary(June Clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the real thing. This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape.|1
"This rendition of ""Noah's Ark"" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. However, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in ""how not to make a movie""Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:""Ok, boys, let's saddle up."" ""It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night."""|1
"The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough . But the other revisionist, which I have just noticed for the first time, is that he was a sadist: ""In the years of 1838 to 1850, Sade, then a thirty-six-year-old _bâtonnière_ who had already been married for nine years, had a string of mistresses, and a series of _enfants sauvages_ to whom he subjected them in the manner of a _pétardier_ of the time. Sade had a deep-seated hatred for women, and a deep-seated love of children."|0
JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects.|1
"This is on my TV right now ... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this video. So how did I get all of this? I got a friend who works at Paramount Pictures to email me and say, ""How can you leave me out of your YouTube video?"" He wanted me to send them a picture of what I was doing so they could see what I look like, so I did. I sent them a picture! I was hoping that the video would go viral and I'd get thousands of people watching it, but that didn't happen."|0
When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed.Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music.|1
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. It fared modestly OK at the box-office.Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in New York City--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. Instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by Faye) was never filmed.|1
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot , or corny acting , then Backdraft is definitely worth a viewing. I've watched this movie twice and will be doing so on the third viewing. It was not perfect, and there were several holes in the script, but that does not take away from it's quality. This is the first film from writer/director R. Lee Ermey. Ermey had worked in the military in Vietnam and had also had a relationship with his wife (who is the same age as his son in Backdraft), so he knew what it took to bring a story to life.|0
This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It is very danish and the characters are very real. It is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It is really about love that has no gender. I would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story about love and life.The story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense.|1
I went to this film having no idea what to expect. I actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.I only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There's A LOT of subtle humor.Here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: A big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society.|1
"When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end."|1
(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.|1
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here . but I really did not find this movie to be funny at all . its not a bad movie but i just felt that it went on way too long with a lot of annoying characters who never seemed to make any sense . its not like i was waiting to see the end but it seemed like its a lot of pointless filler . but all in all i would rate it a 3.5 because it was good for something that i had not seen before but could not find much of anything original .|0
"What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, I'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I've put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you've got all that great dialog like - ""Dave, look at the composition of this mud."""|1
"Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. I hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC's ""Best of Britain"" series."|1
This is a difficult movie to watch , and would have been even more difficult had I known then that it was going to be made and what its focus would be on. That being said, the characters are fantastic , and the plot has some really beautiful passages of dialogue that really stick with you for days after you finish watching it. This is a story that really deserves to be seen by more people, and the film is made with such a loving touch that makes you wish it was made a bit longer and not as a 2hr film.|0
This is marvelous movie, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes talk. Especially on the silent scenes. The window of Ale is a great one. An the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I have seen. Apart from directing. It has been a quite time I did not watch a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul.|1
I loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid, and then as I saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid, watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible.|1
"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called ""Big Fat Liar"". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie!"|1
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy.This movie is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. It's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success.|1
I tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't sit well with me. Although the performances are good, the writing isn't. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we're supposed to side with Casey, given that she's the protagonist, but I don't find her at all likable. The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable.|1
"""Admissions"" is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make her overworked mother not notice, she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the acting is first-rate especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put in great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the ending."|1
"Satya was excellent .... Company was just as good but more polished , probably owing to the money earned from the business he was running before leaving the company. Pranav,
I'm not sure how you are supposed to evaluate the quality of food served at a particular restaurant, but, given what you have said, I am pretty sure you are right. Let's put it this way, if we are all in the same situation with respect to eating and that is what decides whether we are satisfied, we are probably not in the same place in life."|0
i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though.|1
"The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as ""beyond belief!"" ""no words can express how I feel about this"" ""This movie will move you"" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie."|1
This movie was pathetically awful. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. This movie totally rips off Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy I should say).I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. I watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. I actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes I do.|1
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics.|1
I ca n't believe I sat through this garbage . Palm trees in D.C. ( already mentioned ) , a man and a woman with a baby in the background with a baby seat , a man sitting on a couch , a man standing by a piano , a man with a hat and cane , a woman walking by and a man walking towards the man sitting on the piano . I think they should have cut the film to 90 mins . I am waiting for a sequel and will be very disappointed . They made a nice film .|0
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice.|1
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson. This film was not it. It was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely awful. Her acting was so bad it was like watching an A1 airhead trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice grated the nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius.|1
I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script.|1
I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life , and each time I watch it the more I am stunned at what it depicts and how it portrays what is truly happening to the human psyche and how it can be altered to do anything. It was made in 1974. It had a budget of 1.6 million pounds, but it was still not an outright flop, earning $2 million and racking up 2 Oscar nominations. (No other film has ever won an Oscar for best picture without winning the directing Oscar as well, so I guess those two wins must count.)|0
"A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. The tagline for this movie should have read ""Come see how f*cked up our characters are! They're stoned! They're coke addicts! They're a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter?"|1
The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time , but it has always interested me , and I like to learn about all things related to it. It's an era that saw America at its peak of its military capabilities , then at its worst, and has since been seen as an example of an over-armed military . It has also been seen as a catalyst for change in the nature of American politics, particularly during the Nixon administration. It's worth remembering that before the U.S. had entered WWII , America had no real military , and had even considered the possibility of never fighting a military conflict.|0
I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?'|1
Significant Spoilers ! This is a sick , disturbing movie ... just like the sick , twisted director , Jennifer Lynch ... she really does a great job with this sick, twisted , horrifying movie . I would call this one of my favorite movies ever ... I thought this movie would get a negative review since I did not want to spoil anything ... I am glad people did not let the film be spoiled by the trailer ... I really enjoyed the movie . I think this movie is really well done and worth watching ... and if you are still thinking about seeing this movie ... you will really enjoy this movie .|0
Does anyone else think that `` Reba '' is basically a ripoff of `` Roseanne '' ? Just look at how funny they both are at the end of the episode. Maybe the producers just wanted to put two very funny ladies on the air so that their fans could find out about them! I guess. You have to remember that the characters were the real people and not those that they portrayed. The one thing that keeps me from buying or watching the show (or any other Roseanne episodes) is the character of Beth's mother, which is just as bad as Rose's character (if not worse).|0
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain Nolte. Foprget questioning anyone. Nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. His methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut.|1
I hope this is n't a portent of things to come . High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time. And as I've written in the past, they are getting better and better. It's amazing to me that someone with such a fine camera could be so oblivious. That said, I'm very happy with what my Canon Vixia was capable of shooting. I didn't need to have an expensive camera to capture the most beautiful things. But I do think there are times when high-definition is worth a lot more than what it costs. There's just one problem.|0
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G rated movie. This is a feel good movie. The story is mostly from the view of the children. The interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. If you liked the Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy this. I viewed this movie on cable. Either on Encore or Showtime family.|1
This is a forgotten classic of a film , and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for `` Gummo `` . I have seen it a few times , and it is probably one of the funniest movies of all time, but I had never actually seen it as a kid . I've always said it's one of my favorite old movies, but to be completely honest it's not one of my absolute favorites. It's a great movie, and I do like it alot, but I just never saw it at all as a kid.|0
This was Hitchcock 's third Hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of work. This was the third Hollywood feature of Hitch's , and Hitch had been shooting on location in Italy for nearly a year, and still had not shot a film in that country since 1929 . In Italy he had to find a new script, and he did, with a story by James Thurber , who had been working with Hitchcock on the script for Lifeboat , which had not yet received the go ahead , but which would later.|0
"Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. ""Scene Of The Crime"" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre."|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. That was kind of a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it.|1
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer due to this film. I have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. I would rather watch Star Crystal....... Holy cow maybe that is not a good example. The main question I have about this film is... Was it to be a morality film?|1
Oh boy . Where do I begin on this piece of slime ? This is one of the few real masterpieces that has made me smile. I've never seen a bad movie in my entire life until I had this film on. The acting and direction were impeccable. I've never seen a movie with a better script than this and it is a real heart breaker. If I had to describe this film to someone, I would say this is the film about the world's greatest love story that is not love story, but a life story about how love can become hate.|0
Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this is n't bad ! In fact it 's quite good ! It 's very good in fact ! The problem is it 's very expensive ! It's not very long but very interesting and entertaining ! I don't like most Julie Andrews musicals because she is a very self-centred and selfish person ! It 's very entertaining to hear her singing in a bad voice like this . I really hope that this song will get more popularity because the story is interesting , but the voice is not very good .|0
Wow... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now. To say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love.When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide I figured it would be a spoof... maybe it should have been. Could have made for a better movie.Look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever. They could have sprung for a fan at least.Look for several Canadian & c-list actors in the movie.|1
"I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue)."|1
"I like ""Hack."" Think the ""Lone Ranger"" reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver, a decent but flawed guy, in Philadelphia doing his best, while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past, and you've got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding ""Silver"" in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly, without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average."|1
I was hoping to like this movie , to settle in for an evening of goofy fun . I like a good , well , silly movie . I was looking forward to watching it , thinking that this was a good film , not a great one . I found myself disappointed , it was very dull . My wife thought the film was great , she even loved it , which is a rare thing for me to find . But she had to turn off the sound when the characters were laughing . I have had to do this so often over the years .|0
Having watched this movie several times , I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring movie and I will not be disappointed in the outcome. It is based on true events but it was filmed in such an amazing way. There was a great acting cast of all kinds that worked very well together and the story kept me totally captivated for its whole duration. There were a lot of twists, twists and turns and you will have to see it to believe what happens. There is some violence , but it is not as violent as some of the movies out there.|0
Wow ... I suspected this one to be bad ... But now I find myself just at a loss for words. As I read, I thought to myself ... I can't even find the words to explain how I feel ... It is just so unbelievably sad that something like this is happening to such an amazing family, to a family that has made it their business to help others ... I hope they find comfort in knowing that they are doing the right thing, they have made their own personal decision, and they will be there for their children, no matter what, and that they made a good decision.|0
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung . The acting was over the top, the plot was too stupid , and the writing was a big fat waste of time . I have never seen a movie this bad . I can only conclude that they got the director of this film and the rest of the production staff into a deep dark pit that they just couldn't escape . Maybe they have all been on the drug for the last 20 years . After watching this filth , my only desire is to put on my shoes and walk out into the street and burn this filth out .|0
If extreme activities ( and I do n't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games ) and the people who love them are the same thing, but I do think there's a big difference. I also think it depends on what you're getting out of it, and it's not to be confused with the people you want to be around. I've always been very happy with my relationship with my gym. But now I am not so sure it's going to be the same. I've made some good friends, but there's more than that.|0
This is the first porn I 've ever tried to review . It demands a different approach than usual , and you'll see how good it can be . I only got a few scenes in , and I had a pretty hard time keeping my eyes open ( I was on the bed and my partner was in a chair next to the bed . ) It's worth saying that the whole time I was watching I thought about getting off , but that didn't really happen . For the most part it's just the girl being a slut .|0
"Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie , terrible acting , cheesy dialogue , and not quite `` the best movie i've ever seen
in the history of cinema "" is the best movie i ever saw. My rating: 1.0

The plot of the movie is terrible. First it is supposed to be an American epic, set in early 18th century America. The only thing that would have made it better was if it was set during the Spanish American War, but it's not even set during the war. It is instead set in the aftermath of the war."|0
This film makes several nods to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a Replicant (He is blond haired and is called Ryo, a homage to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?).|1
The greatest movie ever.How's that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time.|1
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired, it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted.|1
I thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. Well I was totally wrong. There's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood film. They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? This is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.I thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original.|1
I think the `` Bone Snatcher '' should go after anyone associated with this movie . Watching this will seem like torture to anyone who is not a fan of the series. This movie is pure trash and a terrible example of exploitation cinema . What a shame! First of all i think it would be great to know what director was behind it. But for me personally i just dont like the movie, i dont think the director did it justice, i find the story very weak, i dont think the story had anything to do with the movie.|0
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery). He hooks up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!).|1
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock , it 's apparent that Big Al 's fear from the police dates back to the war years of 1940 's London. Truffaut says, in his conversation with Hitchcock: ""A lot of things that did happen, I saw in Paris in 1940, and it didn't stop. It didn't make me go into hiding."" In his film, Truffaut rewrites the famous Hitchcock scene where Cary Grant and Jane Greer meet in the woods, and Truffaut writes, ""Here they meet. They can't avoid each other."""|0
This movie is bad. I saw the rated and the unrated versions. They are terrible!! Now, I know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. It's not funny! Not funny at all!! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie let me down. At least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. And is it me, because Mundae is not a great looking woman.|1
Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in `` Beware , My Lovely , '' with her brother and her father. She was once married to Robert Ryan. And she has a daughter, Mary Jane, who lives with her. She's about to tell her what happened to Robert in her past. She has been hiding something from her daughter. She wants to know about Mary Jane. She wants to know what she's like now. What has become of her in her adulthood? What are the things that she does not tell her daughter.|0
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew that I had to see this movie, even though I can't say I'm a soccer fan. But watching this just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it.Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it.|1
This film could have been great- but wasn't. Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one stripped off. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish.|1
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people , not helped by a poor sound mix. If you’re reading this, and you’d like to donate, please do. I’m sure you’ll agree that this should be the best movie in the whole wide world. You should see it! And you can! I am currently in a bit of a state of shock over the passing of my grandfather, whom I was only vaguely aware of until just last week. He passed away a couple of weeks ago, after being struck down by cancer.|0
I 'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people . The series started off really well, but then the author decided to make her main character an idiot in a lot of the scenes. It is obvious that there is more to the novel then the characters. The characters do get along well. The author makes them seem like real people and you get to know more of their lives and pasts. There are a lot of great scenes in this book, but some of the characters do have a problem with this book.|0
"Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named ""To Kill For"". It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ""ability to sell"". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.Maybe the fact the delightful, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18."|1
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years. There have been other films before that delved into the Vietnam Vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film, as a typical American suburban family, circa 1972, comes apart at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls. The cast is A++++ fantastic with all four actors(with Kathy Bates a stand-out) giving riveting performances. What is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides, but understand all four characters and empathize with them, even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs.|1
"This one and the one prior `` Toulon 's Revenge '' and the next one seem to be completely different from the others. If anyone knows if they have changed in the meantime you could report it as a bug. It seems to be the same as the one with ``Toulon's Revenge"" before. It also has the bug described in

https://github.com/toulon/toulon/issues/28

I would say that this one should be a new bug since it has been around for some time and the bug described in ``Toulon's Revenge'' only affects the one we are talking about now."|0
This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet . Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who has to find a terrorist who has a bomb hidden in the trunk of his car at the airport, and he must do it with the least amount of force possible. As the movie unfolds we realize that the man who has just stolen the car is not really a terrorist; it is actually a cop. The plot of the film is well-constructed as we learn what is going on and what we want to know as we follow the characters on their journey.|0
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book . So of course , I have some interest in reading this book. And I don’t just mean I am interested but it is also a favorite of mine . I read it a number of times. The book was written during the time period between the end of WW2 and the early to mid 1960s . And in that period it is a very good book . It is full of historical facts and details of the war and the aftermath . And it also covers the time when the book starts .|0
No matter what other people have said you ca n't review this movie without comparing it to the original , but i will do it . The movie is so bad , that the only reason to watch it is that it's remakes a few times in order to keep the interest in the story going . Even with the few remakes , it can never be compared to the actual story . The remakes , to me are like the original , but with different actors . That was a good movie! The only thing it had was a boring ending, but it had a wonderful story.|0
"I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really too bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. Why Joe didn't just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode where the ""message"" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end I was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and I won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse."|1
Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . With a script that could have benefited from a great director’s touch and a cast that is not all that deep, this is just another of those films that could have used the help of a good director . Unfortunately, it has a number of problems that come from having a weak script , an underdeveloped story , and an uninteresting cast . I’m not even going to bother to try to explain how the film begins , because it’s not very easy to describe .|0
My Mother Frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill).Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight.|1
This movie sucks so bad. Its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained American twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. As for the bit where they make the French President drink 'bad water', that was just lame.|1
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration.|1
I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a woman's life in Boston. It was the same night my father was killed. He was a cop and a good man, and he taught me a great deal about this country and what it means to be American and to be part of something bigger than ourselves, part of a family, part of an idea of how we want to live that's bigger than me, a bigger idea of who we want to be, a bigger belief in what we are, than anything I had.|0
"This film has its detractors , and Courtney 's fey dresser may offend some folks ( who , frankly , look pretty good to me ) But , for the love of God , please leave us alone and let us be. Tuesday, September 30, 2008

I know I've mentioned this many times before , but , if you've seen this film , then you know exactly what i'm saying. The movie is about a woman named Sarah ( Jennifer Hudson ) who is so poor , she doesn't have enough money to buy groceries."|0
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following , then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected, and the film would be one of the best movies of 2014. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be happening with Following , the first in a planned trilogy that will see him returning to his roots as a filmmaker. In the end, the film is far from Nolan’s best work, and though the acting is solid throughout, it just isn’t enough to make you forget that Following is Nolan’s film.|0
I 've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake. The story of Alice is so intriguing, well written, entertaining, and just plain fun to watch. I'd say it's up there with The Wizard of Oz on it's list of the greatest movie adaptations of all-time, but I can see where there's some people who may not agree with me on this. Personally I love it. If you have never seen it (and you should), I would strongly recommend that you do at least once.|0
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came.|1
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end . Although there are some , but it is definitely a great movie . It shows the true story of a man who died from cancer . He has lived a very rich life . He has done his work well . The movie goes through the ups and the downs of his life . I enjoyed it a lot . I have not watched it many times in the past , because it was very difficult . Now it has become fun . It is hard to believe in such a big movie .|0
Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through.|1
"I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by the film. In it, a young woman (Amanda Seyfried) tries to find peace in her small town by taking a stand for a cause, only to find out that standing for anything is a difficult task. The story is told from a third person perspective, which I felt made the film very different and unique. I remember seeing this on the big screen during that time and thinking ""this is a masterpiece, I want to make films like this""."|0
Intelligent summary , is n't it ? If Mad Max was something of a simple , straight forward , nothing special movie , it would be a movie about Mad Max . If we were to add some of the humor that makes the Mad Max movies such fun and one of the main reasons why the films are such a blast is because the action is so crazy and insane . When Max Rockatansky was a kid in the 1950s, his family was forced to move from the West Coast to California because they couldn't afford to pay their house mortgage.|0
Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD.|1
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class . And some dudes were enrolled just so they could make movies. So, I decided to write a script based around this movie idea. It took me about 3 weeks to write a full length script - with all of the problems that comes along with that (namely, you have no idea what you're doing) and I took about 6 weeks to get this thing from the ground up and ready to send to a publisher. So it took about a year.|0
"This is a piece of cinematic beauty , and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other movie in the past 10 years. Here are a few fun facts from the movie:

If there were people from other places on the planet who could travel in the time period of the movie, there would never be a need to write “Canada” on their passports. They would just come up with a new name that sounds more Canadian and that’s the way they want to make their life easier."|0
First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong.|1
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner . I really did n't understand the guests . I knew they lived in the country and that they were both in their forties. I thought they would be nice guys . Not sure what is in their minds and in their hearts about each other. The first episode is about him being a victim of some crime. I think he is being framed by his friends. There is something very fishy in the whole show . I just hope they find out the truth about him. I like Dean Learner and hope that the show comes back for a second season .|0
"What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works' themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim ""strangling the boy for the purity of his scream"".You can't fault Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality."|1
The Toxic Avenger, Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'.|1
Yeah great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's Australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur.|1
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch , this movie was a disaster. And that was after it was originally released as an exploitation flick. So, here's an apology from someone who was involved in the project. And the truth is that I'm probably just going to end up hating this movie, which, in any case, had a lot going for it. This was the director's debut and Foch played the love interest. So, in other words, we are talking an un-doomed failure.|0
It's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches Froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.When it started I already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players.|1
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and ""the Wizard Of Oz""."|1
This movie is not just good , its amazing . Besides providing us with good performances , original plot , and great storyline , its also a very touching story . I would love to watch this movie again with different actors . This movie is very great . The characters are very sweet and adorable and the storyline is very deep and very touching and very emotional . Its a must watch . Its very nice . I love the characters . I hope they will get an Oscar for their performance . I will be waiting for the sequel . Thanks for the awesome movie and the great screenplay .|0
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment.Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way of wasting it.It was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted.|1
I have just caught this Movie on TCM , and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this is what he really is. This is not to say that I think he has done some good work, but its to say he has done his fair share of evil. And I don't understand how people can get caught up in this kind of thing if the whole point is to get elected and have some say in how the country is governed. Its not a new phenomenon, its been around a very long time.|0
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder if they were written specifically to irritate you. But you do get some, and you are not always able to avoid them. Some have been attributed to Woody Allen, but I think the most likely candidate is Mel Brooks. I first encountered Brooks’ film, The Producers, in college in the 1980s but didn’t get around to writing about it until my last year of graduate school. I don’t have the time or the inclination to explain the film to you in detail.|0
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers.|1
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig.|1
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.|1

You can usually tell something is rotten in the state of Illinois, and you probably can make a good guess at what it’s about. This is because Illinois, like most of the other states in the Midwest and the Northeast, has seen a steady deterioration in its quality of education."|0
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure.|1
If you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating... but I cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way Paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad the way Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life?|1
"`` Hollywood Cavalcade '' is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster , George Raft and Gloria Swanson. It's no coincidence that the film title is an anagram of ""The Hollywood Cavalcade,"" a reference to the musicals of Hollywood and Broadway and to the ""Cavalcade of Progress."" In addition, the film is named after the famous Cavalcade of Progress Parade of 1908 that started at Hollywood Boulevard and ended at Highland Avenue. The first parade was held on the night of July 4, 1908 and the second parade the night of July 5th."|0
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great I forgive him.Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done.|1
This is one of those strange , self-important , self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound . It is also a bit silly , and even self-deprecating . It does have a good plot , although I found the characters hard to identify . There is not a lot of action in this movie , it is rather long and boring , and it was over long , but there is nothing wrong with that . The cast is good , and they all work together well . The only thing that was slightly lacking was the music .|0
Plodding , maybe that should have been the title . Bad dialogue delivered at a snail 's pace . All too often a character is so bland, he or she is hardly worth watching . The only good character in this story is the wife , she plays a very important role in keeping things running , and she is also not given any character development in this book . There is also very little humor or levity , it seems to be an attempt to make the book less depressing . I am glad to see that the characters are so uninteresting , but then again , it is very hard to make anyone likable .|0
"The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat the annual Halloween parade with fear, fear, and more fear. Isolated from the rest of the world, it is up to our four characters to save this small town, to save their own hearts, and to prevent themselves from falling into the depths of hell that awaits everyone who crosses them.

We are about one month from the book's release, and after much anticipation, I think I've managed to do it justice."|0
If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting , jokes , props , and lines as we did with them, it's a good sign that the story is funny and entertaining. If it is not, it does not matter how much you try to explain to the audience, you'll never win their heart and it will end up being a bore for everyone to watch because there won't be any interest. Do not underestimate the importance of how a scene is presented, and what the characters' reactions to the situation is.|0
I have seen this movie three times . Going back to VCR 's , in the 1980 's , and on VHS , in the 1990 's . They are the closest thing to real cinema that is to be found . This is my own interpretation of the films . In the late 60 's , I had two of the most enjoyable years of my life. My first years as an adult film producer/director . So many films were being made that we all wanted, but most people never saw them , and we had to do the work of distribution, marketing , promotion, advertising , and getting films seen.|0
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films , but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. I do not agree with the director who made this movie. He has made movies based on many other religions so it is obvious he has a lot of experience. The plot is so thin it could be the film is just too small in its size. That does not help either. There is not a single character who I liked. Even the lead was a bit boring and there were so many scenes where there was nothing happening to keep the viewer interested .|0
"Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski 's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as he builds a new film from a new and different source. The first in the trilogy, ""The Double"", is as good as anything else he made, and the third one, ""A Wedding"" (also known as ""Journey to the End of the Night"" in this country), may well become one of his greatest. The second one is, in fact, not only superior to the first, but to almost everything he ever made."|0
"The 1998 version of ""Psycho"" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because ""it was air conditioning."" I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen)."|1
"I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life , but none are coming to mind right now. I'm sure I could do it, I just don't see how I'm gonna have the motivation to do it. I'm not complaining, just asking the question out loud, if anyone wants to chime in here, feel free. Thanks

In all seriousness, it does not take much motivation to go to bed or work at a consistent hour. I'm not saying that it would be easy, but I'm not ready to quit my job yet."|0
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. He shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family. It is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would.|1
I saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. I just recently found an original VHS version, and purchased it for $125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the Broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.Why, it's just a little over paying for a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release this in DVD form soon. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!|1
"Honestly, I don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. It embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. The storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit ""Fast"", that is a good thing.Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easily as good as Tom Baker.Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela.I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus."|1
"Eleven years ago , Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding his identity and becoming one of the world's most influential figures in history. Today, in an exclusive interview, he talks about his new book ""Unmasked"" and reveals the inspiration for the book: “I thought, 'Wow! I don’t even know where my life goes from here,’ and I thought, 'What am I going to do with my life? '” He says. “There is so much to do."|0
Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on her. But is she just a stupid idiot who does stupid things or does she have a secret identity that only she knows? This movie had many plot holes, but the acting is pretty good. I love that in the end Jessica is the good person and not that stupid. I also find this movie very funny. They do a lot of comedy, but it's not as funny like in the movies I like. The movie ends with the tree falling onto Jessica's head.|0
The greatest movie ever.How 's that for a contention ? However , if we look at it through purely cinematic terms , and not to be confused with those who believe that we all have to see this film to have some idea how good it is, it's a magnificent movie. And for a film with so little dialogue and so much use of visual aids , there's hardly much that can be said about it.I don't think it needs any commentary, except to note that it is not the only movie to take the 'no dialogue' route , and it's far from the worst.|0
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . I can't stand it when my dog jumps into my lap and whines and I have to put my arm around her. I could be on my deathbed and I would be crying. I could swear I heard a gun shot in the middle of the night . I can't stand it when my baby cries and I have to sit with her for two hours while she cusses at me and tells me not to leave her in the car . I love to read .|0
Tumbling Doll of Flesh ( aka Niku daruma and Psycho : The Snuff Reels ) This was on my want list for quite some time now. The last time I saw this movie, it was in an art house cinema, in the middle of a festival, and I don't remember seeing a single other movie. This movie was the talk of the show, and it was so funny I couldn't even contain myself. It's the perfect movie for a Friday night in. It's funny, scary, and sexy, and the best part, it's all done with puppets!|0
There are so many holes in the plot , it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience . what a waste of a movie . it's clear from the previews that they couldn't have done it any better . but i don't care if they had a perfect script , a perfect cast or perfect everything else , just do a movie that makes you laugh or make you cry , but not both . i'm not saying it's not funny , or doesn't have any good acting , but it's not an enjoyable experience .|0
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time . I 've always been intrigued with the way this movie looked . It's a beautiful movie that I would love to see again, but unfortunately I never got a chance to . I think that it would be worth seeing again though, and I hope one day we will get another movie of ELECTRA GLIDE . I have to agree . Electra Glide has never been released on Blu-Ray. Electra Glide was my favorite movie for a very long time .|0
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits.|1
If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli `` Okkadu '' you will find this to be very similar. That may be partly because we have a lot more information in the Telugu, and partly because we are not limited to one language. However, in both stories we are dealing with women. In both stories, the women, in both the original and the adapted versions, get back their pasts. In both, the woman in trouble gets help from a stranger. In both, they get help from a man they have known all their life.|0
On the positive , I 'll say it 's pretty enough to be watchable . On the negative , it 's not enough of a jump scare, and the ending is predictable to the point that I can 't believe there isn 't a sequel . The film also has its flaws , but nothing that will stop you from seeing it on the big screen . Story - 6/10 It 's a decent concept, but unfortunately it doesn 't work well . I don ' t think it 's any better or any worse than a lot of horror movies .|0
I 'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie . ( I 'm not counting super bug budget , no offense to anyone who likes that.) However, with the exception of Wonder Woman ( and possibly X-Men ), there hasn 't been a successful comicbook movie I haven 't seen at least 10 times. This includes movies by the studio that brought you Spiderman , Batman , and others. It's not that I haven't seen them; I have seen them a time or two, but it's that they don't do the superhero genre justice on the big screen.|0
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque.|1
"Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.While I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, ""Nurse Sherri"" is really not all that bad."|1
Based on what little i have seen of this show I do n't think I will ever watch it again, the last 3 episodes were so bad it was painful, the writing was bad and the acting was bad and so so bad. The worst of it all was the new characters they put on a boat and had to deal with them in the last episode, it was so painful it was like watching someone die. I don't think they will ever recover, but I have to admit to having a good laugh at it and hope they get another chance to tell it like it was.|0
Superb editing , outstanding acting , especially by Epatha Merkerson , and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack . This film reaches a very high standard as a thriller . The story could have been a lot worse and it could be a lot better but it was very enjoyable . I am very satisfied with the final product . It is an interesting tale with good acting that makes it a thriller . Great job by everyone in this film . It is a good movie to have a good watch . This is an excellent action movie . I enjoyed watching this movie . It’s very good action film with very good acting .|0
This film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. However, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life, in particular the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8, and World Bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned.|1
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that bad, which I felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very Bad. There were songs & songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown Germans speaking English which is so rubbish. Germans does not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have gave some money to her) In the promo they have shown prepare for Laughing riot.|1
"It's complete nonsense. I've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the ""parallels"" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. It's crafted for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.Who made this hit peace? Easy.When all is said and done; Que Bono? That is, who benefits, in the long run?You don't. You sacrifice money and rights."|1
"It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops ""Derailed"" and ""Second in command"" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film ""Until Death"" had no martial arts in it at all!! !That being said, this film is significantly inferior to ""Until Death"" which was a really good turn for Van Damme."|1
"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits."|1
This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead.|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie . In fact , there are some who think that the movie had some background info that were left out . One of the things that are not mentioned by the film makers is the fact that there is a very strong possibility that all of the people in the film are not entirely human . And there are many theories as to why there are some of them that look like human . And there is a very strong likelihood that they are not human .|0
It 's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters . But it is not just the characters they wanted, they also wanted a story about women. But I have a very strong feeling about the fact that this is not going to be just about women. Let 's think what the story about women is about and let 's see what happens when these women decide to do something else, when they decide to have a relationship with men. And in this movie for sure, we will see that.|0
Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill's life upside down.|1
The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only `` star power '' if we can call it that, is that of the guy who does the voice-overs. He may have the ability to sell the movie but that doesn't make up for the plot holes, the characters who are clearly not the real deal, or the sheer laziness of the film. The script is good enough (for the most part) but the casting doesn't help matters and even the music and the special effects don't give anything that isn't readily apparent from looking at the film.|0
"It's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: ""Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget."""|1
"It seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress ""Othello"" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in ""Shallow Grave"" and (especially) ""Jude,"" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on ""Oz."" One would think them both natural Shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: Walker's Othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and Eccleston hams it up appallingly as Iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role."|1
"I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie . The acting is astonishing , the movie itself is powerful and moving , but what really made the film was the cinematography . This is a must see. You can see a sample of this movie on YouTube. “It’s a wonderful film , one of the best that has been done in Britain since the war .” – Michael Cimino

There was no one who had ever given me cause to complain about the films I’ve seen in my career. Not Michael Cimino nor the director Stanley Donen ."|0
So, you wanna be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or you're REALLY into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes.|1
"Well Folks, this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however, the additional downside includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline.It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediatly ""focuses"" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days) and his parents are coming to viusit him."|1
It 's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released . Since there was no film to ban, however, Hollywood has just made a new movie version of this story . So now, you will see this story as an extra in another movie . And you will find out that this is true . The story goes as such. In this movie, a little girl is sent to a special boarding school because her father died in a car wreck . In the boarding school, she is kept as a baby by an evil woman .|0
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he's had his successes and failures, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: They will be something unique.|1
Eddie Monroe is Hooooot . He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime . He 's hot , he knows how to talk to the ladies and when you talk to him he doesn 't give a damn about anything else . This movie has one scene where Eddie is driving and he is trying to figure out a way to get in to a phone booth from the back seat because he needs to call home because his car is not going to start . The movie is set in the late 70's but the way it is told and played is just as dated as that time.|0
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot . It was very watchable and very funny. I can't wait to see the DVD version which looks more than I expected. The only criticism I have is that it took a long time for the plot to progress. What I've been reading is quite good - I found it interesting that there was so much controversy about the film. The only negative I have about the film is that I had to watch it with the subtitles on. It seemed like it was very slow.|0
This isn't a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties.|1
"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now""."|1
Produced by Nott Entertainment , this movie is `` nott '' very good at all . I sat through the first two minutes without watching the movie to get a sense of where they were going, and by the time the film went on, I was not interested . Now, if you do get to see it , I am going to recommend that you wait until the first minute to watch it . Then you'll know exactly what you are getting into. The story is so predictable that the ending is almost a surprise . It is so long that you don't want to end up with your hands full .|0
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest . The movie had nothing exiting and has no new content . It was a big waste of money for the makers to make a movie . The movie has nothing in it which makes you think about anything . The story is predictable , there is no real plot . You are just looking for something to watch . It is not entertaining and has no substance to hold your attention . It is not that bad ,but it is a waste of time . There is nothing in the movie that is worth a second watch .|0
This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea.. However, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one.|1
I rented this movie , because I noticed the cover in the video rental store . I saw Nolte , the director of the picture , and was very impressed by his artistry. So , I bought a ticket for the video rental store. I did not even bother to get out a ticket to see the movie , as it was already sold out , and it would not be showing at the theater. As it turns out , I got to see the movie , and found that I loved it very much. So , what is this film ?|0
As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars.|1
"Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa.I saw this movie, waaay back when I was eight, in 1996. Back then, CGI films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. Also, back then we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, I've held reaally fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is clearly a robot."|1
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.|1
After a very scary , crude opening which gives you that creepy `` Chainsaw massacre '' -feeling , everything falls into place in the second half and the movie really kicks into gear . in short , the first half of `` Hellraiser 2: Bloodline'' is a scary movie full of gore , blood spattering , torture and all out gore . but the second half takes off on a different note and gives you a much more positive feel for the movie - the second half of the movie contains some of the best scenes and plot twists in the series - so if you liked the first movie - you'll love the 2nd .|0
I 'll give it a two because it has a lot of music , otherwise it would be a one.I 'd have it rated 4.5/5 if it wasn 't for the crappy animation. Story: 8/10I can see why the story might be lacking... but I can see why you might like it. I loved it! I would recommend watching the 2nd episode... I think the animation in the first part is pretty bad, but in the second you can see the animation better. Animated Character: 8/10It is not perfect but it's better than nothing!|0
I was so excited to finally watch `` Pulse '' after receiving it from Amazon , and I have to say it was pretty awesome so far. The story was pretty great too, even better then what I had thought at the time. I thought that it had a little too much action and suspense and not enough character development for my tastes. I have to say though that it is getting a little bit better. The characters seem to be getting more interesting and more developed as the story moves on. And I think the story is getting more exciting too.|0
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago , Jr. (Spencer Treat Clark) in the 1940’s, the story of his love for his employer’s granddaughter, a young woman with whom he falls in love and his eventual acceptance and reconciliation of her love for him. The story is set on the grounds of a historic estate in Southern California’s Coachella Valley as Nanny, who has known him for years, watches his life evolve from loving servant to loving friend.|0
Even though this film 's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character , I might not have seen the film because of a few things: 1) I didn't have cable 2) The film doesn't sound very good. I saw it at a local IMAX theatre and it looks like it might be a good film. I thought that was odd because the film is based upon a book which had been a huge hit, but it turned out I hadn't been watching enough books. I've been watching more so I was watching more films.|0
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film . but , for whatever reason , I was very happy about this movie , as I had never seen this before, and it was also the first time I watched the full film . and , I am not sure if I like this movie , and it is also not the greatest , but it is definitely better than a lot of action/horror movies . I do not know if I would recommend it , but I do not know , I have never read any of his works, but I have watched a lot of his movies .|0
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival . It was great . Stormy is one of the best movies I've ever seen . And I agree with all those who say this movie is one of the best films ever made. For those who don't see it in a theater or need to watch it on a smaller screen. I think this movie is worth the cost of renting it . You'll enjoy it even more. I was very very surprised at the story of this movie.|0
I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc.|1
This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title role in this show’s last season, so we knew it was a good show. It was. He did an amazing job. The acting was superb as well, and the writing was superb. There really is something to this show. It is one of those shows that leaves you speechless when it ends. There is no way for me to explain what makes this such a great show. I think you need to have seen it to really appreciate it.|0
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London , I was very excited to see this movie, and have a lot of good memories of this show. However, this movie, and most of the series are not worth watching, at all. Let me start off by stating the obvious. The plot is shit, and the characters are boring, and the plot is stupidly convoluted. First of all, the first thing that is important, and should be kept in the forefront, is that this film is the best version of the story that has ever been written.|0
This film is bad. Not so bad it is good. Just bad. It is however hilariously bad. I watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other Chuck Norris film ever again. If you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).It is a constant depression to me, as I grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10.|1
I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel bad for the main lead who was such a bitch. It was a good story but I couldn't really take pleasure from it as there was something missing which I didn't even really understand what was. I liked the acting but I can't really take pleasure from that either. The movie got a lot better in its second half especially with the story which wasn't the most original but there was still something which gave me a feeling of what was going on in this world.|0
This movie is bad . I saw the rated and the unrated versions . They are terrible ! ! Now , I have to tell you , I don’t like horror , I love horror , I love the suspense , the horror , the scares , the tension , the blood . I am going to write an article about this flick . I will put in all the information that I have in my mind . Now , please read the review below . I hope you have some time to do some research and see the movie . You have to understand , this movie is not rated and unrated .|0
I'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. This movie is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made.|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler ' at the Toronto Film Festival this year . While the other reviews have been kind to the new movie it was not because I enjoyed it as much as a lot of the reviewers, in fact my first thoughts were 'how did this movie get to the TIFF screening room in the first place'. The film is based on the book of the same name written by David Lipsky who had the idea after reading a short story written by a man he knew who was diagnosed with terminal cancer.|0
Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.|1
Irvine Welsh 's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh , all with the aim of making you laugh. The story of a pair of drug dealers who travel to the Scottish capital to score, the film is in fact a very funny and engaging film in its own right. This isn't a film about drug dealers, but the drug dealers who travel from Edinburgh to sell drugs in Glasgow. And that's why the film is a bit hard to describe. But it is worth watching, and you really have to give credit to Irvine for creating a character that is funny.|0
Well , this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version and add it on, but I am not sure it worked, the actors are all too old to play teenagers and I don't think they'd be able to find any kids willing to be cast in the parts. It's too old and too much a story of romance for a young person to really take to heart. Still, I think this movie is a lot of fun and is one of those films where I think it's better to leave it a mystery to the audience.|0
"Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever ... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe . The music from award winning writer and director Alan Menken is always entertaining, particularly the songs from Tangled in the Bowery ( which has a terrific song called "" I am the Boss '). The performances are excellent as well and are always entertaining ... and there are no weak links in this production . If you're looking for a show to see, you can't go wrong. Fantastic cast, great songs, great direction and costumes. The cast is amazing. This is one of my favorite Bogart shows ever."|0
The only reason I did n't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable . I think this movie should have been 2 hours long so they could have given us some popcorn and drinks. I have to hand it to them because this was an entertaining film filled with action, but i thought the last act was extremely boring and only served to add to the already long runtime. I will give this one a 6.5. The acting is good but there were several parts where i wanted to smack myself and then laugh so hard.|0
I think my summary says it all . This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a group of ‘curious’ teenagers who go on a variety of misadventures around the Los Angeles area, in the spirit of that show. In other words, they go on a bunch of wild and crazy adventures, which are filmed using a camera-shy teenage model (and one or two ‘cameras’ themselves). There’s even a segment where they try to record the experience and use their video to answer a few questions about the experience.|0
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of, including several on the stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen! He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. The way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (as Hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life.|1
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here is how the movie starts, Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is A OK as long as it only targets soldiers (In case your wondering, Men) However the virus back fires (Big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. Then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man.|1
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. It's a simple story: a young boy is born into the wrong family, he befriends a witch who teaches him about his magic, and they fight against a wizard. They make it all the way across the ocean with the help of the wizard's daughter, but it's not enough to survive. I remember watching it with my dad. I remember him sitting there with his mouth hanging open and me laughing so hard he just had to slap me on the shoulder.|0
This is a classic continuation to Bleu , the likewise excellent film , with Juliet Binouche as a main star. The screenplay, co-written by César Domboy, Nicolas Lebourg (who wrote for the French version) and Nicolas Rovère, was based on Pierre Bounine's novel . It is an original and very interesting story, in which the plot takes place at the end of the 1970s. Jean-Claude Lemire plays the lead role of Julien, the son of a black farmer who returns to his village to try to settle down there.|0
Reba is a very dumb show. You can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who resembles a real-life person. I guess Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba.|1
"I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters."|1
I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, though. Maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime.|1
This is an astonishingly bad action film . I 'd say its primary flaw is that it 's BORING . It 's really hard to believe that a big studio is making a movie that is so boring . And yet , we have a lot of people paying money to see this . The plot of the film is fairly standard , except for a few twists in the tale . In the beginning of the film , we are introduced to the main antagonist , a group of terrorists who come to town , with a goal to blow up an art museum .|0
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min , luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my money , it took me about 5 hours to read through the entire book , it took me longer to read through it , its very good . I think the movie will be good to watch . The book is full of details, and the movie might be even better as it has a lot of extras. Overall, I think the movie's a lot better than the book, but you could also read the book and just skip to the movie.|0
I think this is a pretty good movie , but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me . It is what makes this film so special . In the film there is the story of an old man who is in the last days of living and trying to make his last days worth living . He knows that his life is nearing the end but tries to live his life to the best of his ability. He has been very successful in business but his life and his wife are going to be very sad as her husband has to go on an important mission .|0
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you , if you like your films with a strong narrative, I would suggest you give the film a chance as you may surprise yourself. The story can be very confusing and the way the characters are written down could also be confusing if you don’t know about them. But if you are looking for an emotional ride or you like your drama to pull you in a different direction or if you just want something to watch, this is it for sure.|0
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral.|1
"Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word ""visionary"" in them. Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them."|1
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on Quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such faint praise from me.|1
"As an ex (nuclear) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the ""inside jokes"" from the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the ""Orlando"" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely ""DBF"" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the Admiral in charge here?"|1
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. The movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. It had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.In short, I'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again.|1
One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films , `` Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster '' turns up the volume by giving you no dialogue at all. It also features some terrific monster designs by Karl Freund , including his monster with an octopus for a head , which was the inspiration for the film's best-known monster . Despite the fact that this was written and produced in the 1960s ( and is almost as long as the Scooby Doo movies themselves ), the script and story are fairly modern , with the movie's two main characters played by two young actors at the beginning of their careers.|0
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I've seen both of those as well as Chop Shop and like in many instances, I don't feel the comparison is warranted. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added.|1
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity . My friends and I went to the theater last night in New Orleans to see this movie. We were all about 10 feet apart. We all thought the same thing: This movie is the definition of trash. The whole movie was trash. It was so bad that it hurt. I couldn’t see the monster in the movie. I know that sounds stupid but you know how I am about movies. It’s just a fact that I will not sit through an entire movie where there is no monster.|0
One should not be too critical about the director's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.However, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.Any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.|1
"One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, ""Ten Cents a Dance"" stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dance-hall girl ""Barbara"" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite ""plain-jane"" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who's very different from the dashing Carlton."|1
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile . Jolie 's acting is pretty flat and uninspiring and it's not as if her character lacks motivation for doing whatever it is she does . At all . The script is even worse. This is a movie for kids . I don't need to tell you what a waste it is , but I think I'm being overly optimistic . Kids will go to see it and think it's funny and cool . There is no other movie in history that has the potential to do that .|0
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast . The quality of the camera work makes this a special film and I highly recommend seeing it in a theatre . I think it deserved to be nominated for best picture . I liked the movie, it made me smile and laugh. This movie reminded me of the first Star Wars movie I saw and now I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Wars and sci-fi . The actors are amazing and all of them are good in this movie.|0
"Certainly this film is not for everybody -- -but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period pieces, it is worth a look. It can be viewed online for free - but please do remember to click through to the source material if you are interested in obtaining a screen capture. Wednesday, March 24, 2010

I'm very curious to know the story of how the film was produced and who it was shot with - so far I have been unable to come up with anything on this subject. A great deal of mystery surrounds this film, as well it should."|0
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK, I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN’S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets! ), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)!|1
I remember watching Police Squad ! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a pretty decent police procedural. The first half is a cop trying to catch a serial killer. Then it becomes a drama about a corrupt cop who has an affair with one of his cases. Then he is replaced. Then he dies. I was 12 at the time and I don't remember much about it but I knew that I liked it. This is the only one I've seen. It was a movie back in the late eighties.|0
Well I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the cast album and I've listened to it a few times I've never actually seen this show performed and I haven't seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. This version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett.|1
I didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible film from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialog, music, whatsoever! I don't mind a low budget..However you have to get some point. Wandering, wondering..pointless..then two boys started kissing in bed. awful,,just awful. I love indie films, don't mind it is slow. However this movie disappointed me from any perspectives. Even the Graffito, not artistic.I was wondering what kind of people would like it.|1
THE worst movie I 've ever seen , and I 've seen allot . Acting is horrible , plot is horrible . I was so bored I almost didn't want to stay up through the movie , but I didn't because it was really stupid , and the only way to make a stupid movie is to make it stupid . The worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty lame ones, but this one is by far the worst , so I won't even comment on acting . The plot of the movie was just horrible, and it was stupid .|0
"Let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it ACTUALLY TRIES TO COME ACROSS AS A SERIOUS MOVIE. From the terrible acting... ""I knew it, I knew she was possessed! ""...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. I am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. This may just be in a class all its own. The kicker is that supposedly some Cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation."|1
This movie was terrible . You could n't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie . It would be better if the actors were actors and the story line was better . This movie should have never been released in theatres . In theaters , this film was average . I did not like the movie at all. It was boring and not very interesting . It was way over priced. And when you have over priced movie, you don't have to watch it twice . You can go see it once . In theaters it was boring and had very little plot which was very sad .|0
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film . After years of being on the stage , Grace decides to try out for television . She's cast as the lead of a soap opera . The studio wants Grace to appear in a number of short scenes in which her characters will have sex . When the director gets her to do some of the scenes , she falls in love with the producer . So he asks her to do a few more scenes , but instead of filming them himself , he takes out a camera crew .|0
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. We know from a few letters written by Mary Wollstonecraft back in the 18th century that Reggio, who wrote the film's screenplay with his wife, would have made his mark on the history of cinema in Hollywood. Now we can see that he did indeed, with a remarkable vision and a lot of talent. The story was to have been based on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft, wife of Henry (the poet), who died on January 22nd 1797.|0
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other?Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.It's funny reading comments here about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a heel.|1
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age . Clayburgh and Coppola are not as concerned with making a movie like they are interested in the story and are willing to let their film do the work of creating a film for them . The film starts off with the teenage girl having to get into the car and Clayburgh makes the teenage girl get into the car . He drives around the block . The film ends with Clayburgh holding onto the girl as he tries to find out who is the father of his son .|0
In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo comes to London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.|1
Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories, well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force.|1
"Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it . And to make his movie he used members of the Cult of the Black Hole as the cast . Here's what happened when his movie was released

This is the tale of how Tom Leroy built a horror movie out of members of the infamous Cult of the Black Hole cult. The story of how Tom Leroy made his cult horror movie has been told a few times in the past. It is well worth watching, if only for the shock and disgust it contains."|0
The Evil that Men Do ( 1984 ) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 1980s. The film follows the efforts of a small time criminal (Bronson) who is caught by the cops. After a series of arrests the police finally catch him, but he escapes and is taken to jail. After being tortured by the prison guards he escapes through the ventilation system and hides out at a bar. The bar is being visited by a woman who has escaped from prison after committing a rape and murder.|0
i love this show . i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the next one come on. so i watch every season to know what will happen for my favorite characters. it's always sad for me because i love this season. and when it finally end i hope my fav character will come back. so it's really sad to see it go because i love it when it's over but it's also a time to get excited for next season. but for this season it's sad.|0
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover , but we 've discovered it was a picture taken from the movie, The Blind Side . We're still waiting on confirmation from the studio on whether they will put this back in, so if you want to buy the DVD version of Blind Side , go to amazon and check it out. It's available for sale there or at Amazon. It has been on sale for a while now. The DVD and Blu Ray are also available to pre order from Amazon .|0
The core issues at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film). End of Days, unfortunately, is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon. Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.|1
"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous rift, a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"".The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife."|1
While not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys history.Basically, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brains behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie so what do you expect? Mike Love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius.|1
I 've been a fan of Larry King 's show for awhile , I think he does a terrific job of getting his audience on the same page with what is going on in the world of politics. I think it 's easy for him to get across the issues that we are facing. For me , Larry King is the only political show I can listen to when I have time. I listen to this radio show as I am doing my work , I don't have time to do other radio shows or read newspaper.|0
I'm racking my brain, but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You gotta wonder why John Ford and/or John Wayne never tried it! The plot  While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus), and the rest of the cast/characters enter a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but some other, more fearsome creatures as well.|1
"This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. It is easy to see why ""Fire"" has caused riots in India, but tragic nonetheless. A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world, not just privileged westerners."|1
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women . His play was well received by the audience and his publisher took him on board and put him on the best selling list. But Mel Dinelli had other ideas; he wrote a followup play in which the lead role was taken over by his wife and the original play was made into an even better musical comedy . Mel Dinelli is still alive and is still producing his works. I can think of many other examples . Here are my two favorites which are also my favorites as far as productions go.|0
"Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in ""Demons"" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by ""The Smiths"" and ""The Cult"", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing."|1
You'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!|1
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization.Read Proust, you morons!! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies.Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, HOURS...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW!!|1
Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.But this movie?|1
Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe. The music from award winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.|1
"Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a couple of things. First, this film is nothing like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like it.I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the basic approach of the film maker is not ""surrealist"" per se. therefore its not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a weird Euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of ""wierd"" not surreal.Secondly, I think the music by Heuzenroeder is brilliant."|1
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with.|1
One of the best,Lackawanna BluesGreat movie,great cast,great music,this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes,I will w3atch this one many times. This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period.|1
I 'm racking my brain , but I ca n't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of Gwangi that I can remember. The film is based on true events that were witnessed on the Korean peninsula, and it was a great movie. The acting was fantastic and the scenes were beautiful and touching. But, I have seen this film so many times now, but it still leaves me speechless with it. I 'm not even sure what it would be called in English, it is so different from all other Korean drama.|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the Bone Eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date.|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder , two other scientists , a pilot , and the guy who plays the main character. In the film , Mulder's girlfriend, Scully, has an affair with Agent Krycek. Mulder and Scully's friendship is never the same. As the film progressed , Mulder and Scully got to know each other at more of a personal and emotional level , which eventually made their friendship stronger. Mulder has become a man with a lot of guilt about his relationship with his ex-wife, and he gets to be a much better father to a son with his girlfriend.|0
To think this film was made the year I was born . To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away by the police in this day and age . The film was made in 1968 and the police were in the 1960s ! I don’t want to see my mother and other people in the movie killed . And I don’t want to see myself in the movie killed too , because I will have no one to tell the story to. I want people to see this movie, so they will learn to stand up for what is right .|0
I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as I found the story here a bit disjointed as I was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. Still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.|1
"For a moment , let 's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie , even if it is a film in the genre of sci-fi . Even if we don't know very much about the movie or its source, we would be very much interested to know the truth about the characters of this movie. So let me share a little about this film and its cast. The film was produced in 2005 and directed by James Gunn , the former writer-director of ""Guardians"" and the original director of ""Battlestar Galactica"" ."|0
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, I still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans,and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Medieval times. Lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion.|1
`` Yesterday '' as a movie , is hard to rate . The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10 . There are very good performances from all the actors in the movie , which makes it an all around great film . The movie has a lot of heart , passion and emotions in it and the plot is well thought out . But unfortunately , the movie doesn't live up to the awesome score which was composed for the film . The score is very well written , beautifully performed and has a great deal of emotion in it , which makes this score a must have score for any film .|0
The most obvious flaw ... horrible , horrible script . This movie had a potentially good story , but it fell flat on its face. The script was written by a very talented writer, but he failed miserably in the writing. I will not even attempt to defend his script or the script that was actually used in the movie. I was so dissappointed in the film , I just stayed in the theater for a couple of days and went on the Internet to see other reviews. I will admit I only saw about 3 reviews before I was so angry at the film .|0
"This is a forgotten classic of a film, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for ""Gummo"". Gummo is good, River's Edge is way, way better. Its no secret that Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. No, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover."|1
"I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company , but here’s what they are selling:

So if you want to see what I think of this movie it should be on sale around here or maybe you could make it to Australia and buy the movie. I will be there. I will buy it there. Then we can get to talking about what’s going on back in the United States. It’s like I’m going to a funeral and you are going to be my friend."|0
"This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the head-banging music this movie revolved around. Chris/Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME!! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery. The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride."|1
Has this ever happened to you ? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals. I'm curious about what's new on the block, so I browse through the DVD section for a couple of weeks, trying to keep an open mind as I make my own choices. I eventually decide that I don't see the appeal of the majority of the stuff that I pick up; I decide to keep some of it in mind, and in the process of doing that I end up buying more than I had originally planned to.|0
At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this film enough, and I'll gladly watch it again.But boy does it have a lot of problems.|1
This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War--most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION--a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer.|1
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers.|1
Dreadful. I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. I just finished watching the film, BTW.I love good cross genre films. This isn't one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, I'll watch them all. But you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.I love philosophical films. This isn't one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately.|1
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it . Based on a true story , this is an amazing story of a very brave little girl who, despite losing her father at such a young age , decided to keep fighting to survive . I think that this is an incredibly inspiring film, one that should be seen by anyone with an interest in mental health , mental health education , or mental health treatment. This film has the power to change the way people in this country deal with those who struggle with mental health .|0
Doctor Who is amazing . It is everyones 'cup of tea ' . It must be . The boys will be fans . It has been a long time coming as a TV show that I would be interested in watching in my late 20s . Not sure why it has taken this long but I am happy that I am a fan . Not so happy that I have to wait until 2014 to see it though . The new series started last night and is as much of a thrill as the first series , I must say . The first episode has a twist which I found very appealing .|0
"Mr. ""Uwe Fail"" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor Directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was awesome, its like a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of ""point and shoot"". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the ""point and shoot"" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another ""Uwe Fail"" movie you will understand."|1
"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.First of all ""The Messengers"" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial."|1
I found the Movie very interesting . I really enjoyed the film the actors were great . It was entertainment and i enjoyed it very much . I thought the actors were very good . the movie was awesome . I really liked it . The acting was good . I really enjoy the film . I had seen it in a theatre so I liked the movie . I really have to watch this movie again and again. It was good but a little too slow but the acting was great I think that this movie would be better but it still has some good parts so go see it you will like it .|0
"The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith ( Wesley Snipes) is trying to solve an issue involving the world's most dangerous drug. The drug is heroin. It is also known as ""the beast."" The Detonator takes place in 1989 where Sonni and a small team of other CIA agents is sent to assist the U.S. military and the police with an operation that would end the reign of organized crime and drug trafficking in the Eastern Bloc. There are some good performances in the film and its cast is well rounded."|0
"Thankfully you don't need a lot of ""book learnin"" to understand where this thing's going... Obviously a poverty row cash-in on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable George Zucco in another of his patented ""mad doctor"" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job."|1
I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger 's return to action after the dismal movies he 'd made after ``I don't know how you can sleep with your door open. You don 't understand how important you are to us. You know, we were always like, you 're not the most important person in the world, you are. But it was nice to make a movie, and we were just lucky. But I never felt as if it was the greatest film we ever did. But it was an enjoyable experience,' he says.|0
I love this show. It's clever and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. As David Morse ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the show.I think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre.|1
"I 'm a next generation person ... i 've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about it and it does look very good so i think it will be awesome

It's interesting to note that people who have actually seen ""Doctor Who"" are all of the same generation (late teens/early 20s)

Click to expand...

My daughter has seen the Doctor and she doesn't think he is awesome (which is a little bit of a problem because I think she's going to be the first Doctor) but she said he does look kinda cool and I did not argue with her."|0
Yet again, director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a cosy life on a Caribbean island.|1
Dante would of been mortified , if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS ! ! ! And to top it all , all this time since his masterpiece was finished , he didn't actually get to use it ! Dante must be a very proud man , since it looks like he has finally achieved something that he has always wanted . And to top it all he must have spent quite a chunk of his fortune on his masterpiece ! ! ! Well , it looks like he finally succeeded . But not without a price !|0
"From the film 's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn ,

It is perhaps a bit too late to tell you how much I loved the first scene in the film 's first scene of Elizabeth Bennet reading the morning paper to her aunt, but I do feel like I already know how it is going to end, in the very best possible way. The best way to tell you how the film ends would be to try and convey what is so great in this scene, so that when the film is over you will remember it as I have."|0
"I went to see this movie to kill some time . I remember Cole Hauser in `` Tigerland '' , where he played a character called ""Tigerlily"" and he did this song in this movie with this line "" It's hard to believe I'm in love."" That's the same line. He played a man who was a womanizing man and it was a womanizing movie. So I watched it, I thought it was very very funny and it was a little bit dark at the end. It reminded me of a lot of different movies."|0
OK , so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er , sorry . . . it's like watching porn. My mother is a movie buff, but I'm not sure she'd be impressed with my latest viewing experiment. Here I am, watching the first five minutes of David Lynch's film Lost Highway. I had seen the other three installments of this series, but was surprised to find that these were the first in which I actually recognized the names of any of the major players.|0
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like ""Ride Little Cowboy"" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.I had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice."|1
"I still count `` Police Squad ! '' as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s . Somewhere , out there , there is a TV show I watched that was far superior to the Police Squad . The only other one I can think of offhand that came anywhere close was The Avengers . But if you can find one , I'd like to see it. - - -

It's easy enough to see where this story came from. If you're going to write a TV series set in the late 1980s and you want to do it right, here's the first thing I suggest."|0
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something. When I finally saw her I nearly fainted right there. She looked so perfect, so beautiful, so radiantly alive. It was amazing to look at her at this age, but I realized how lucky I am, I have the chance to see her every day when I'm on the subway coming home, or out walking with my dog. And if she's on a television show like this, I know I'll be watching, because she looks so alive and radiant.|0
... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.All others be warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.The film is good for some laughs though. Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie.2/10 for unintentional comedy.Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.|1
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s , Italians made so of the best movies , and then , with the decline in quality , everyone decided to leave Italy and make movies in other countries ? Why are Italians the only country in the world in which we have so few movies that we can be proud of ? Is there a difference between the Italian cinema of the 1950s and the Italian cinema of the 1960s ? No, there is a difference between the two Italian cinemas, even though they both had something in common that makes them different.|0
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film, and that's the weight of the plot. I don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it, expecting the film to be as it was marketed... The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuses and defames graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay.|1
Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor , and when I first saw it I thought “Oh, it’s like that” and it took a few viewings to settle on it as my favorite of the year. But, it’s so much more. I’d like to talk about why I love it so much and why, when you get to the end of this movie you’ll find that you really have enjoyed it, and the reason is in the movie.|0
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on , who I liked a lot. Heather is pretty amazing as a person, but is also hilarious as a stand up comic, and as someone who has been in show business for some time. So I figured, why not give it a go at home and have a little laugh while watching it? I got Heather and her husband over for dinner and it was great to have an evening with her in our little house. If you like this kind of thing, then give it a shot.|0
The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges . The story is told mostly from the standpoint of Moptop, the band's drummer, with the other three main characters getting most of their scenes, save for a few lines. I thought it was well-written enough to warrant a rental . I will also be watching the first two parts of this series . If you are looking for the best rock & roll movie, this one is it . Go watch it . If you haven't seen it , I strongly recommend that you watch it as soon as you have a moment to spare .|0
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on . It 's a dog, but it 's not real dog . It's an alien in a dog suit . I still don't really understand it, but that's because of the story line . But it was a damn good movie . The acting was really good . The film was very well done . There were a couple of good lines in the movie . It was well acted , well written and directed . The dog was great . The story was interesting .|0
"Better than average World War II-era ""who-dun-it"" featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. The link to ""courage"" is not particularly clear.This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels murder."|1
I have just caught this Movie on TCM, and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this was the best MGM could serve up to him. It is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. It featured two of my favouriteplayers in Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell(the best actor in the Film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady Frances Gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical.|1
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema . By seeing this film , we are able to get an understanding on why movies are considered to have so much power , power , power , power, power , power , power and more powerful .This movie has brought to the world an unforgettable moment . The movie is full with an intense emotional power , which has a great impact and impact on human psyche and spirit . But , why this film has so much impact on human psychology is because of its powerful emotions .|0
This story starts at the end ! So the film 's opening credits advise us . Unfortunately that 's not enough to save this from being a total disaster. I think we are going to have to go with the alternative view. From what I have gathered, this story takes place in a world where an alien species has taken over the human race. They have taken over the minds of people who are still alive and turned them into servants of the alien masters. There is also a group of human resistance fighters against this alien race.|0
All right, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. That's the first thing that's wrong with RL, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission?|1
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie . I came across this and rented it. I did not know who directed it until after I started watching it and I realized it was one of my favorite directors. It is not very well known so here is the trailer for the movie and you will understand what I mean in a moment. Now you are probably thinking what in the hell is that movie and where did I get the idea for it. So let us go into the mind of this director.|0
I never read the book . Now I do n't really want to . I had no clue what this book was about and had no interest in it. I don't regret it . It is by far one of my favourites . I read it in about a week and a half . The characters are really well written . The storyline is really compelling . I loved it . It is about a couple of people who go on an adventure . There is a twist at the end and I liked it . It is quite long , but there is so much to read in it and it was very enjoyable .|0
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart , and I just knew that I had to see this movie. In fact I have to go back to the cinema more often now as a result. I have to admit that I love the movies, and this is a great choice. In fact you would think that this is a serious movie, as it has an emotional weight to it. Well, if you have not watched the movie , you really should. It would make for a great night out with friends, as you can talk about it afterwards.|0
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently, I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) , the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days.|1
I'm sorry but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked big-time. How in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews.|1
"Well , to each his own , but I thought Gibson 's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever seen , so I won 't be seeing it for quite some time . __________________
I 'm so sorry for you having to experience this , but I had no idea that there were people like you in this world . You know, they just got to the point where they couldn't do it without destroying themselves , or they couldn 't do it right without destroying it , or they couldn 't make it any worse , or they could not go on ."|0
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 's exploitation film , except it was done in 3-D. But it is a great film with a great score and a great story. The story follows a group of teens who break into a mental hospital. Their intentions to kill the hospital doctor are soon exposed as they try to escape. It is one of my favorites. It may not be perfect, but it is a great film and it is fun to watch. Just don't expect too much. The first part of this film is really good.|0
I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid-90's as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained it power.It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.The movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc.|1
"I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says ""I miss Elizabeth but I ache for Grace"". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!!"|1
"Writer & director Jay Andrews, a.k.a. Jim Wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-Z computer generated reptiles in ""Komodo Vs. Cobra,"" as generic a rip-off of ""Mysterious Island"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" as you can imagine. The chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilariously awful. However, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable."|1
I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp-fun?|1
This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent . The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the last part. It's very hard to get into - I've had to stop reading at several points, because I just couldn't get involved. It is a story that's been told a thousand times, and to me it is one I'm not likely to read again anytime soon. But I did enjoy it, because as a kid I used to listen to it on the radio all the time. There were parts that were enjoyable to read, and parts I found hard to swallow.|0
In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).His camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist.|1
"I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I found NO enjoyment in this movie. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. It is definitely not in the same category as ""The Cave"" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made."|1
A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton)stumble onto the town of Gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of King's best short stories. In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful.|1
"I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote ""i also expected a Steven movie"", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. In had a little doubts cause i read that ""Ja Rule"" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. And offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. Steven was broke and needed cash?"|1
"Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called ""Half Empty."" I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest Sequel, or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies, we go to be entertained  and ""Half Empty"" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it."|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing , but I just found it annoying . It 's not the fault of it's director , but because it has not seen the light of the day till now , I think I will not see it in the cinema . It will not be a big loss to the history of cinema as I have no interest whatsoever in watching anything that will not be fresh to me . I loved this movie , I found it interesting the first time but now that I know all the characters , its just boring .|0
After having problems in Chicago , the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew , away from problems. They start their lives as strangers, and they discover a bond between them that is stronger than family. The first book in The Solomon Family Saga begins with a farmhouse fire, and the family heads west, not knowing the destination they are headed for. Will they find a place of peace and solitude, or will they run from their troubles and lose themselves in a world that doesn't understand them.|0
"This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie . In one scene , the camera very slowly zoom in on the girl's face , then slowly zoom out. And the girl says "" I just can't believe that you're really in love with another girl "" and goes out of frame. I couldn't watch this. In the beginning , I did think it was funny , but then I started to really hate it. This movie was about a bunch of girls and a boy . There were about 10 girls , and they were all in love with each other ."|0
Excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually.|1
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says . Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. Can you people please stop believing everything this man says . Go your facts straight before you start praising this liar. He has no idea what this country was like pre-WWII

He doesn't give a crap what the world was like in his day. He is trying to change the world and you all just want to sit at home and criticize the world and ignore his actions. I bet if he was in your day, he would be your president."|0
Piper , Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Vampires. Dr. Griffiths is unaware of Piper’s connection to him and she thinks they need to wait. Piper and Prue decide to leave the Manor and head off to the town to get help. They decide to walk into town and find a town square where they see a woman walking along the path. They ask her for advice about what they can do. The woman gives them directions and says to wait for the next full moon.|0
"It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes, trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more, where it failed miserably. Some may like the nontraditional ending, but the attempts at ""deep insight"" into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere.But if you were interested by the story, the movie tried other methods to distract you. The unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was the most obvious, served to do nothing but annoy. The camera-work is erratic at best.One note of caution, however."|1
"Pete's Meteor. I seen this referred to as ""authentic"" and a ""gem."" I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kinda wished that I didn't.Apparently this was noted as being Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother."|1
Without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. If the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven.One wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast. (Well - not really!) The premise is a good one The situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done, but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor said, they changed writers and handed over to someone else.|1
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who's usually an amazing actor, was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt was given nothing to work with here.|1
"In a world full of films -- like ""You Got Served"" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. Ron Hall's ""Vampire Assassins"" does more than cheese you off. It KNOWS that you are mad at it. First: there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: The location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. It's up to you.)."|1
"I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. There is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"|1
This film easily rivals the emotional strength , the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of `` 12 Angry Men .`` And, like the movie, ``American Gangster'' is an example of cinema at its best. For the first time in years, the screen has been given to an honest depiction of the life of a gangster and how a crime can transform a man in his family and the people surrounding him. I am an American and have lived in New York, California and Texas and have visited the UK. I have friends and family scattered among the many cities across America.|0
If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston , it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules César Blowitz, author of the most popular caper novel of all time, the novel that made its author famous. In the opening pages of Blowitz, an innocent American named John Smith is caught in a caper with the French army. The story unfolds as follows. John Smith is the son of an American missionary. He had been educated in Europe, so he has an intimate understanding of Europe’s culture. He has been invited by his uncle to go with him to visit his uncle in Paris.|0
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can't. oh yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now, the shark in this movie is a really fake looking CGI shark.|1
I watched this film last night , i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got to a point where i thought , this is scary , so scary that if it was on freeview i wouldn’t even bother watching it. i mean , i had seen the poster before the cinema and i was a little concerned that it might be something i wouldn’t want to sit and watch. however , i sat in the dark , on the cold floor of the cinema with 2 other people , we were watching this movie and after about 10 minutes i fell asleep in the dark watching it.|0
"""Problem Child"" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue."|1
After being off the air for a while , Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that , while not quite on the same level as the original, still made for a great TV show. This is the third movie in the franchise that has been brought back. The first was The Fugitive , and the second is Columbo: The Incident . The movie is also based on a true-life incident. Columbo was the head of a special unit created to catch bank robbers that were targeting banks across the country. One of those robbers was the legendary John Dillinger .|0
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film.|1
"Does anyone else think that ""Reba"" is basically a ripoff of ""Roseanne""? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who's married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor."|1
"`` Eaten Alive '' goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato 's `` Cannibal Holocaust , '' but it 's a good film and worth seeing if you can get your hands on it . . . even though I wouldn ' t really recommend it , I 'm going to keep it in my library 'cause it has many good moments in it . . ."" ''Eaten Alive' is an interesting film to me in a number of ways. It was made as a series of three films made by Sam Peckinpah , whose career is best known for films like ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""High Noon."""|0
I ca n't really criticize this film . It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead me to watching the entire series. This movie was also a huge inspiration for me to get my life together and move on. The music and the story is awesome, I would recommend watching the series without knowing any Japanese movies. i'm not really a big fan of japanese horror movies but this movie was a very scary movie for me. It's just that I feel like this movie is a classic and it's the reason why horror movies are such a big deal in Japan.|0
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980's version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. Although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes, though.|1
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn't seen or even heard of.Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.|1
This is one odd film . It seems to be aimed at a younger audience , but is filled with scenes of sexual content . I can not say that I disagree with these scenes , because it would be an admission that the movie is not suitable for anyone under 21 . The sex scenes are very graphic , and the film is filled with violent imagery , but the most disturbing thing is the depiction of suicide . I don’t know why it is important to have suicide as a plot point , but there is not a single person who would disagree with it .|0
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so I'll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit.|1
"This is one of those movies that you just do n't want to end . The characters are rich like in the books. They are not like ""those"" movies, but more like the books in which they are found. If the movie had been directed by the director who created the books that I read and loved , it would have been a classic. But sadly, it's not the case. I enjoyed it, although I thought it was really cheesy, especially towards the end. I did think some of it could have been better written."|0
You do n't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it is. And there's an explanation for why the plot is so short, so don't bother trying to find the answers if you don't want to. I just found it a little disappointing and didn't feel the urgency or tension of most of the first season, but I'll probably be watching it again just to see how it resolves. You can probably tell that I'm not very fond of this movie.|0
"...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. I've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that I have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with ""Gone"" isn't happy with what I had to say. So, I've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: """"Gone"" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words."|1
2001 : A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon ? An account of the history of mankind ? An exploration into the nature of man ? Or a description of a man’s soul ? I have come up with the description of our soul from a film called “A Space Odyssey”. And I have been told by some people that it was a very good description from the film. But I say, that is not fair to film and it is not fair to God. We all know the story of man and his soul.|0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company.|1
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who Mrs Payton is desiring to blow the joint with. There is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that Burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the Payton tramp.|1
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie . From the misjudged , often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Strangelove is one of the films that really should have been a masterpiece , and instead it's been a disappointment . If only Kubrick had let it come out at the time when the Vietnam War had ended , with the anti-Vietnam protests, instead of just before , when the film was already over budget . Kubrick, however , must have known this was not the film to end up being . And for that it deserves our respect . There is no reason for Strangelove to be seen in a cinema today .|0
This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts . It suits them well . It is very entertaining . And you have to keep up to date with all the show's new episodes . This way , you'll always be on top of your game . When you know the best shows for your kids to watch , you just have to get in the habit . If you don't do it , then just wait for your kids , and you'll be back to square one . When I first came across this show , I had absolutely no interest in it at all .|0
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn't have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal.|1
For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to `` Rosemarys Baby '' is one big mess. This is a movie about a mother who tries to commit a murder and her daughter is the victim. That is all there is to the story. There are some good performances from the actors, but then you have a story line that lacks focus and interest. And that is what really bothers me. This is the story of a mother who doesn't feel the same way about her daughter, which makes the whole movie even worse.|0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.|1
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it.|1
"no really , im not kidding around here folks , and i so cant believe how many people here have the same idea as i did , i dont even know if i should go and say it to him , it would seem to be a little presumptuous on my part , but that is what i will do , i am just saying what i think

And you're a liar. How can you be upset that she said something you did? She did it first and then you came back with that 'I have a boyfriend' thing. How did you not know that was coming?"|0
This is a magnificent, and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy, with my throat almost strangled with tears, and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD.Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.The fiancé, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic.|1
I 'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one . When I was watching this movie , I had to think about this for long time , I really liked this film . But ,it's not like that it's a good movie . It has a very good cast but I think they should make it in real world . It looks like a movie about love and friendship . When I watch it , it felt like it's so beautiful , and I really loved it . All of the actors were great !|0
This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its potential to make them feel ‘less racist than they were a few months ago’! If you are thinking “but it is a good title” (and a lot of people have used it as an excuse to dismiss its potential to be racist), you would be in good company! This is the first in a series of posts intended to show that there is actually nothing inherently racist about using the term ‘white genocide’ in an article of this type.|0
You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot.|1
If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.|1
`` The Moon Is Blue '' director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release '' The Night Of The Hunter,'' starring Robert Mitchum as a man who kills his daughter and is convicted for a third-degree murder. '' I knew I was working with a monster,'' Preminger said. '' And Robert is one. I felt that I had to do my best to get at him through the story. I wanted to get at what made him so horrible. I wanted him to terrify the audience, to terrify myself. There are things I wouldn't put in there.|0
"""River's Edge"" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw ""Blue Velvet"", you know thats saying something. Viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated ""Kids"". The previews for ""Kids"" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. ""River's Edge"" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better."|1
As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was Bad Acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse.|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl.|1
first off, i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to IMDb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs.|1
"Y'know , it 's very interesting watching this ... half the people involved with it are now dead ... Anyways ... this is what I 've been doing since I was about 14 or 15 years old ... I 'm about to tell you my secrets ... I had an old friend that I knew a long time ago . She was kind of in love with me ... she was a little girl , about 5 years younger than me . It was one of these things where you are kind of like "" Oh , this is interesting ..."|0
Big spoiler right here : this film is B ! A ! D ! But enjoy , it 's good. I ' m not kidding. Let's go over the basics of this film , the movie is about a couple and their relationship. We ' ll probably get to the relationship a bit later and I ' ll tell some of the plot in there. I don ' t like this film. It is bad. I have nothing else to do. Now , for me , it is not a great film.|0
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the , very protracted , end ! The first half of it is a very good watch, and is well acted and directed. The problem with this film is the ending, and I'll explain what I mean . The story is simple, and in some ways a fairly predictable, and in others a very twisty and unpredictable one. The acting is great, the story is pretty good, and you can tell it was made with care and love.|0
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. They sound like today's stats).|1
... a true geek-girl 's dream : high tech , high drama , smart guys , steamy sex , and a strong will to prevail . I'd love to see this series develop into something much bigger than what it is. I think it would make a fantastic film. So far the series is pretty good, but this episode is going to get me super excited for it to continue. I love when they have a cliffhanger to leave me hanging on the edge of my seat. Not to mention, how awesome would it look on film if they did that to the pilot?|0
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I've ever viewed. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it. Me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film. The plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding. The film ended quite abruptly, I'm guessing they ran out of film. Sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway. The guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder.|1
"This is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The lead part Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This film is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l Abner strip! The problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the ""love story"" might make your head hurt."|1
Everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if I'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. Good: The overall plot was mildly interesting. The music was overall pretty good.|1
This movie was everything but boring. It deals with reality. To the people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor,and i deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage,all kinds of health problems, and death.|1
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film. It is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake. Or, perhaps, their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart; looking for any reason at all to dislike them?The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action film, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself.|1
Okay they tell you it 's real . They do n't list any screenwriters or directors , but one viewing will make it seem true . I did n't know that one viewing would make it true . I think the real problem is you can 't beleive it because it's a lie , then you have no choice , and then you have to do what they tell you to do , to believe it , because if you believe it you 'll have to beleive it , and there is no way you can do that .|0
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and social conservatism, where the love of a mother for a daughter is often regarded as a kind of sin. Yet this is a culture that has now embraced same sex marriages. Sara is in a committed relationship with a man. His sister has a young son from a previous marriage – the first step to a family reunion. Her brother and his partner are delighted when they are able to meet his daughter for the first time.|0
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great.|1
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job. On the DVD version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty.|1
"I too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to ""The Outer Limits."" The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw."|1
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story.|1
If you 're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies ( I guess it 's kind of like a hobby for some people, like watching horror movies), then there's a very good chance that you've never heard of this one, and you're going to like it just a whole lot more when you discover that it is a movie by director and writer David Fincher. Yes, you read that correctly. There are many great movies out there but, in order to make a decent living as a filmmaker, you need to create some of the absolute worst movies that there ever were.|0
This is , for different reasons , a very very bad action movie . First of all , Seagal is one of the bad guys in the film. The bad guys , that is . Second , he plays himself as the bad guy, even though he is only supposed to be one of the gang . Third , the film is directed by Tom De Ville and stars George Clooney as his father . What does all this lead to . . . nothing . All it leads to is a very long and boring hour and a half with no plot or character development at all .|0
Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the mostly negative responses I've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy DVD release, I couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit.|1
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber ( The Sum of All Fears ) does an above average screen version of the classic story. But this new adaptation by James Gray ( The Shawshank Redemption ) is a bit uneven, with two very different performances and several plot twists that are hard to understand. The story opens with a family reunion at a farm. It quickly goes downhill when a young boy runs away from the family. He runs with the aid of his father, but ends up in a barn where he’s tied to a beam.|0
"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might."|1
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, ""Falscher Bekenner"" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title (""Low Profile"").Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests."|1
Why is n't this movie on the bottom 100 ? Raptor is , without a doubt , the worst movie of the year. It's not even a bad movie anymore, but a bad idea . It's like watching a bunch of kids in grade school play an adult video game (which actually happened in the 80s, but with far worse movies and worse graphics). The characters are uninspired . They look and act like 2-dimensional cardboard cutouts. The acting is bad, the direction is worse, and the screenplay is the worst. There's no real reason for Raptor to exist.|0
Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale . £2.99 seems like a good price. I watched it, I thought it was good but I just can’t say its perfect . I would say it’s a very good film and it makes me smile everytime I see it. I have a very good relationship with this film and will go back to watch it again and again . I can honestly say I never seen anything like it. Well worth a watch. I love films with a good script and you can see it has that here .|0
I hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, I had to say something.I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it.This movie is one of my favorites of all time.|1
Ah ! When good actors take on bland material ! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight story with good acting and great cinematography then you might be disappointed ! The film’s plot, in brief, is about a girl (Mira) who decides to do something for herself, that is to earn some extra cash and then travel around to different cities to earn a living by singing in clubs and bars. The only problem is, she never really had a job before so how can she start ? This girl has to travel around the world because of her lack of money.|0
Eh . This is a popcorn movie , nothing more . I watched this with a bunch of friends ( a guy, two girls ) and all of us enjoyed it. The story line is good and the music score is well done . You have to watch the trailer first to get what it's about . This is definitely a film I would recommend . The movie starts with the protagonist and his two friends meeting each other. One of his friends tells him she is a lesbian . The protagonist starts to feel that something is going to happen between the two girls .|0
Yes , I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill ! Julie Taymor was born in Paris, the daughter of an opera composer, and began her artistic career by becoming the lead singer of her father's orchestra in the 1930s. This was an exciting time for a young artist who had previously had little artistic experience. Julie Taymor then studied at the French Conservatoire and eventually graduated from the Conservatory of Music and Drama in the 1950s. She met her husband, the composer Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, in the mid-1950s.|0
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center , an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit to young people trying to hit the lottery. Now Paul has returned as a TV pitchman promising the world. It’s an old standby for a lot of people: a sucker’s bargain. It’s even old hat for those who run their own businesses. It’s something people try every day. And sometimes it works. But for most people, the magic formula for success is pretty simple. You have a product or service and you get to market it.|0
i did n't hate this one . i just could n't adapt to the story . it did n't really suit me . i really hated the love triangle aspect and was disappointed i didn't really get a happy ending either . i was so confused i had to look at the movie a few times because i couldn't decide if i liked what i was seeing or if it was boring . i liked the story but the movie just didn't fit my taste. the movie is good but i don't agree with some of the conclusions .|0
"Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. ""Kay Hoog"" reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first ""Dark Knight""- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent."|1
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie movies being made. And that is a point that I think should be understood. There are two main problems. The first is that, as an outsider to the film world and as an Australian in this globalised age, there is an idea that Aussie movies are made by Australian guys with Aussie budgets who don’t want to work in Hollywood so they take their money elsewhere. That is not entirely true, but is part of it.|0
"First , what is really great about this movie : - Ryan Reynolds , great acting ! There are very few times we have seen actor with such good acting abilities , I have seen him do a couple of acting roles in movies , but not like this , and I have also never seen actor like Ryan Reynolds . He did this in a way that I never see actor before or since in any movie . It was really great for the film , i mean a big plus point . What i loved about the movie :

- A lot of fun and comedy in it , i like the comedy part the best ."|0
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting . Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of an ice cream parlor who gets so fed up with his employees that he fires them and buys the company himself, hiring the son of the company's owner as his replacement. Once his business begins to turn a profit, he puts the company in debt. But it turns out that one of the company's employees, Joe, is his nephew, and they fall in love while hiding from a mobster who's after them.|0
From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES ( 1983 ) , comes its even more preposterous ( and very successful ) follow-up, HERCULES 2 ( 1996 ). Taking place in a dystopian future on the brink of a global economic collapse, the film is set for release on April 27th. It is already available in VHS from Lions Gate Home Entertainment. HERCULES 2, like its predecessor HERCULES , is a movie in the most conventional sense. It is set in a future in which the economy is in ruins, the population decimated, and violence is rampant.|0
My girlfriend wanted to see this ( lol this is the case a lot ) ... so I rented it and watched it. You can tell what she really thinks about her boyfriend ( she really does ) as you will see. But then she starts thinking she is wrong, so she tells the guy she was dating to get rid of him and then she just goes away with the guy... and I can just tell that he has no clue what is happening to her, I don't know what it was about this movie but I felt like I was watching a ghost story, like it wasn't real.|0
"What an utter disappointment. Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead. What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane? ALL the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for ""lowest common denominator"" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people."|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a little too much on bad dubbing with the characters having their voices too high for their words to be heard at all and not very funny at all...I give this short a 2.5 stars! This is very good movie with good acting by all the main actors, the dubbing was also great! I would definetly suggest this one to everyone, I know it wasn't the best dubbing in the movie but the actors, music and the whole story was great!|0
"During filming , was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon ? It was like she was reading from an autocue . I asked the casting director why she couldn't act but he said , 'If she'd been born a man, she'd never have worked in film . ' ' But she's so feminine, she's a star . ' '

That was all that was said . The only reason they asked me to do that film is because my mother was born a man and my father was born a woman . ' '

' The reason I went to Australia was because I thought I'd meet my father ."|0
Well , first off , the twins are exactly the same . there is no one is girly and one is not . this is what makes them so sweet . they are just the same as every other girl or boy in the world . and they love each other . i really believe that they would fall in love one day . even though they have been together for so long and that they are still in love . but that would mean they would get married first . right ? i mean , it is not like a boy and a girl can stay in love for eternity .|0
First , let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is . So the book may have nothing to do with me. I do know she writes good fiction. But I don't know who she is. She could be from the south, or the middle of nowhere, she could have been born in a shack in the woods, she could be an old lady in her 60's or 70's who loves reading, or she could be a guy in his 30's, or 80's, or even 80's.|0
"It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman."|1

"I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this...ever! My favorite part is when Grace(Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, ""WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?"" I do believe everyone(No matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile."|1
WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through.|1
This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos . It 's done really well and has a lot in it , so I feel that it should be up there with some of the best movies of that genre.I 'm not one for this type of movie ,but if you like the way it ends , then you can enjoy it with a lot of enthusiasm.If you don 't like it ,then I would suggest not watching it. What was it like to make the film and how did you come up with the idea?|0
I saw this film in the movie theater . I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course I knew this movie was a must see . I had seen it many times in the theatre but I just didn't get it . I had never seen it in 3D until this night . This was a must see . The performances were incredible . Overall I would definitely recommend seeing this film especially in 3D . I saw it and it was amazing . It is worth the cost and it was worth every penny of the cost .|0

I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X . Luckily , my hopes have came true . You have already heard about it in my other review , so I won’t go into details now . However , the sequel will be coming out in July , 2012 . We will get to find out more details in the second part of this review . As per my other review , here’s how the story is progressing . It’s so much better to read it . Gen-X is a sequel to the hit movie Gen-X . The movie was a great success at the box office .|0
There's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts.|1
Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word `` STUPID ''? The answer is no, it would be too easy for you, but as I have never used the term it would not be trite. But what I am going to do is to create a list of things I like, and what I like is that the world is changing. The thing is that I don't use the word `` STUPID '' but I am going to use the word `` IDIOT. ''|0
They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.OK, the plot. Some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there are no more.Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent.|1
This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen . It shows what us what our forefathers have been through . I am sure this film will change our lives for ever . I strongly believe this film can change the lives of many who live with HIV/AIDS . It can save them from going back to a life of drugs that can lead them to a very bad end . I pray for all those affected by the AIDS virus and also for all those who live with HIV / AIDS as this documentary will help to break down many of the taboos that still exist .|0
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz.|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky.|1
"A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their infant son, and how their life was turned upside down when they began having sex in their sleep, in a house full of people who loved them

The sun was shining in the late October afternoon when I walked out to the driveway. I stood there and looked around me for a while. Everything was white as snow and the air was cool, even in the shade of my umbrella. It had been raining, a steady downpour of wet, heavy snow."|0
A middle aged man, Robert Jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set. He has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with Mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.|1
I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS ! ! ! ! This 16mm disaster is full of clichés , stereotypical villains that have been done to death, clichés of the era, but not this one. I can't quite remember all the names of the characters and I have only a faint idea of the period, but the film has all the elements you should expect from a disaster in the '60s: a nuclear powerplant, an army of aliens, tons of money, lots of power, a bad-tempered dictator , and a few good-hearted individuals who have to stop him before his evil plans go off the rails.|0
This movie was boring. Very much like Underworld, only even less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. The lead couple were boring. I totally didn't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the film. The plot was paper thin. The transformations were basically nil. I did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, I would have liked that better. I wouldn't recommend this movie.|1

Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a mission to help other children in Ethiopia. I know you're wondering what I'm talking about and why you should even care, and that's a good question to ask yourself before you pick up this book... and before you even pick it up. And if you're going to pick this up, you really should do so knowing something of what you are getting into. If you're just going to read this off the cover then you might as well get rid of it before you begin.|0
Despite the all-star cast , this attempt at epic fails . It comes across as a set of flat cartoon shorts , like so many children's cartoons from the 1950s and '60s . But even if you're not a child , it's worth seeing . There are some clever touches here and there , some very funny cartoons , the music is excellent , and most of all the animation is very well done . Even the few scenes where the action slows down for comedic effect are still very funny . The voice acting is excellent . This is a series of short animated cartoons.|0

`` Landscape after a battle '' opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather the manner of the TV series Prisoner - a scene which could have been lifted straight out of the BBC's '' Prisoners of War'' series, which would have served the story better. The opening of ''Landscape'', as in ''POW,'' is a bit of a stretch and it doesn't have much of an edge to it in any way - and it doesn't have enough of an introduction.|0
I know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; I was , at first , a little sceptical . I thought that there must be some scientific reason for such things , and that this reason would be very obvious when I learned more about it . However , this is not the case , and still less so in the case of the universe , which, it appears, is in the state I described . The only thing which seems to me to be at all obvious about this universe is what I said above , that there is no reason to think that the universe is finite ; it is infinitely big.|0
This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it needed was a different director. That's certain. And perhaps a different leading lady. I just can't understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was completely unbelievable. I cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. I am writing this as I am still watching it.|1
The film begins in Latvia just after WWI . Being a history teacher , I knew that multinational troops occupied Riga in 1919. I also knew there had been some sort of pro-communist revolution in 1923. I did not know what that was, until I saw the film. There was no communist party in Latvia during the Second World War. The Soviet Union occupied Latvia from June 22, 1941 to May 27, 1944. The Film opens in Moscow . It was shot on location there. The director was Sergei Yutkevich who is best known for his Soviet propaganda film ‘Lola’.|0
Kazuo Komizu strikes again with `` Entrails of a Beautiful Woman '' , the sequel to `` Entrails of a Beautiful Young Woman '' (1968), which made him the highest-paid director in Hollywood history, earning more than $100 million in its two-year reign. In contrast, he made more than $200 million in the five-year span between `` The Godfather Part 2 '' and `` Apocalypse Now '' (1978). Komizu, now 72, is the first Japanese director to have a hit in Hollywood. He made his directorial debut as an actor, working with Yumiko Enatsu in the 1959 film `` The Housemaid's Secret. ''|0
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures . If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky that shit is, I bet you will be able to tell right away just by how nasty they are. Anyhow, it has now been on the shelf in a box for over two years and there has been no action on it, not even from the distributor. It has also been on the Internet, but no word on where it could be. So, that is why I am bringing it back.|0
"This noisy , dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well , that's not quite the way it is. There are a few great lines in the film - such as the line ""I can see your vagina"" - but you can't help feeling like it wasn't really all about them. Or maybe you're in the minority when you say it didn't seem like it was all about the actors (I can think of at least three women who seemed to be more about the film, and several who seemed to be more about the acting)."|0
`` Mr. Bug Goes To Town '' was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced . The quality of this movie was so good that for years the director and the actors were not allowed to release any other movie until this masterpiece was done . I don't know how many of you have seen this movie, but as soon as I saw it I began to cry , the way a little kid does when he sees his own reflection in the mirror . Then I started to laugh, a great laugh which could be heard at several hundred yards away .|0
Yes , indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie ! The only reason I chose to vote was because I wanted to see it with my son, but he didn't get a single vote, not even a thumbs up! And now I have to wait until I see it again. I've seen it before and I must say that I was expecting a lot of the things in that movie that were not shown in the end. And I don't even have to go over the things that were shown in the end.|0
Just in case the title did n't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review ? Yeah.I decided to see this movie based on the trailer on IMDB but it didn't hold my attention for the first 15 minutes. It didn't hold my attention from the moment I opened the film until I finished it. So I guess if you want a film with a nice story and an engaging script, then watch it. Otherwise, don't bother. I have seen it 3 times and every single time I found it to be very dull.|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. on Russian TV, but these guys were on the same boat with the likes of Oleg Tabakov when it came to getting work, as this is not the case for many of the most talented directors in the Russian TV scene. If you're a fan of a particular director on Russian TV, chances are you've seen one of their shows more than any other. The TV industry in Russia and the world are full of such directors.|0
Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time.|1
I liked this movie , not because Tom Selleck was in it , but because it was a good story. Not the most profound thing ever told on screen , but an enjoyable one nevertheless . It has it's own plot , not to mention it's own characters , its own style and its own tone , with the occasional addition of a few lines that just aren't used in most films . The plot is about a group of soldiers that are sent to Vietnam to bring back a man who has been killed in a firefight during the war .|0
"It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial ""wake-up call"". And, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. Such is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities as I have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. So, I was unaware of the majority of what Lawrence had gone through prior to this film."|1
The girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. What I'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. Lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. And if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: They are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion.|1
While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) I must say that I thought the script and acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has crafted a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven delight. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. Her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet Bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open.|1
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I did n't want to watch it , but I thought about it for a long time and it got to me so I decided to watch it and I'm so glad that I watched it with him. The first two hours was very boring and I was bored but after two hours I was very happy.It was really sad that it ended up like this. I don't care if the movie gets nominated , I only care that the people that watched it cared about it and I hope that this movie will win.|0
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s, Italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films didn't make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and `exploited' by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday.|1
"I loved so much last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece ""L'Ora di Religione"". It had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say Castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!)."|1
This is only the fourth effort I ’ ve watched from this director ( whom I met and found quite impressive). He is an interesting artist but he is a little too attached to his previous work. I would like to have seen more of this director's other work. I also would like to watch a more in-depth review of his earlier work as this review is a bit of a general overview. This film has potential to become a great film in my eyes. I give it an excellent rating. This is my first time watching a film with a rating of 8.|0
A terrible deception : controversial film , winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003 , Mil nubes de paz turned into a critical and popular success, for which he won a number of prizes. It tells the story of a young musician who works as a waiter in a gay restaurant in Madrid during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. It was first screened in 2003. It has been nominated for an Oscar in 2004, and won an award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004. In November 2005, after being screened to the press, it won the Teddy award for best European film.|0
As far as I am concerned , this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to other films of that time. For one thing , it was written by John Cawelti who was the author of two books about a young man named Philip Marlowe , and it was the first story I ever read where there was no question of a happy ending . It was such a disappointment to me that I could have sworn to God I would never ever read another book or article on Philip Marlowe ever again. As for the film itself , I thought it was great.|0
"I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question.....Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yep....they do full meals too.Love the comment by the guy who hated the ""EVOO"" comment."|1
It´s all my fault . They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of this genre, and that´s why I should stay away, right? So why am I seeing it right now? Maybe it´s because I know nothing about what is happening on screen, or maybe I just want to watch this movie. Maybe, just maybe, it could be because it has been a while since I was in this mood to see this movie. Maybe I just need to feel the story.|0
"Hey guys and girls ! Do n't ever rent , or may God forbid , buy this piece of garbage. You have been warned , you know what the truth is. This is not a piece of art , this is garbage. Not even a decent game , just another waste of money

I was excited to try the game, but i was very, very let down. Not because there is no story or anything of the kind, it is just not as good as i wanted to think it would be."|0
"That 's all I can really say about this film . It 's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and Death, but with a lot of more sex. There are a few sex scenes here, but this film has no real ""sex"" in the film. The sex is there, as much as the rest of the film. But the sex is there, but the film is not and does not pretend to be. It is a parody of DBZ . This film is more like an episode of the TV show, except the film is not ""episodes""."|0
My parents may enjoy this show , but I fail to find the humor in it . What is so funny is the fact that the characters and the acting are mediocre at best . I don't see the laughs here . I would not go to the movies for this show , as I have never seen it before , nor do I plan on it ever again . I am not a huge fan of sitcoms anyway , and I didn't see this one for the comedy , so I can't find the humor in it . I've heard the same thing from others .|0

This movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. All the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes I ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. At least I was entertained. The ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I didn't care to remember. And what was with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. And where the heck did that guy (John Corbett's character) come from?|1
I agree with all aforementioned comments . This show was a delight to watch . Funny , witty , terrific and just great to watch . I have never seen a show this good . The acting was superb . I would give this show a 10 . I've been on the edge of my seat the past 5 minutes. I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting anything. But this show has been good enough to make me forget about what I was expecting. When I say good, I mean great! The acting is top notch.|0
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful . There are very few laughs but most of them seem forced. I know that I'm not the only fan of Carry on but this film, while entertaining and funny, is really boring and not funny in the right way . I don't know why the audience is laughing so much at a lot of the scenes and most of the dialogues . I guess they are watching it as a kind of a reality check and it's not that funny .|0
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too.|1
"Disclaimer : During my ventures into foreign cinema , I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies , both from the Indian and International scenes . With this one I would like to talk about my experience in watching these films, in the hope of sharing something , which might interest others too. Introduction

I think that the introduction to this post could not have been any better than the title itself. This is because I have been looking for movies to discuss on this blog, which are not only in the Indian films, but in the International Indian movies too."|0
"Synopsis : the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs , Hannibal is a big budget production that totally steals the thunder from it predecessors. I was the guy who was the last to sit down to a meal at the Ritz. It's not like there weren't others, but in this restaurant I had the pleasure of being seated by none other than Al Pacino. Now that's the kind of guy that would never be considered a ""friend"". That night, I sat down to a feast, but it wouldn't be complete without a little bit of conversation."|0
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995, I dismissed it offhand, saying that Julie was no Daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid.But here it is, 5 years later, its on Disney and im watching it again. And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as I made it out to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever. And Swank's character isnt that bad, her acting is pretty good considering the script.|1
"Journalist Bob Woodward 's blistering , scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi 's rise and fall becomes the basis for a new movie by filmmaker Brett Ratner , to be produced by Ratner 's production company, Ratner-Scott, based on the book. Woodward , whose book won the National Book Award for non-fiction in 1998, writes in the introduction of his latest book that he has ""no regrets about making the book"" or about how ""it came into existence"". However, he says he does have regrets, namely about the way his own book has been treated in the media."|0
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version , with some of the actors re-casting themselves? That's the way it works in Hollywood these days. But I'm sure the producers are working their magic and there'll be something different about this. The original was shot by Douglas Sirk so I'll give him a lot of credit for the way he did it. Now, in the 1933 version, the camera had to get up close so that the actors didn't get too close to the screen.|0
Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast, great lead performance. Worth watching.Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright.The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.|1
A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies , The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach , Lambeau, who is fired and must try to find a job with no experience or references. He finds one, as the coach at a small Midwestern university. The movie is in part based on Lambeau's autobiography, and is an excellent piece of satire. The movie opens with Lambeau, an unemployed former high school teacher, sitting on a couch at a diner waiting for a woman with long dark hair and big brown eyes, whom he recognizes as his former girlfriend from high school.|0
"Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself ""this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...."" then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie."|1
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. It unintentionally shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy OR the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience.|1
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (I may get to watch another one, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is out). For all star John Carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all! ; James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's manservant.|1
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels . There were loose ends with the writing and the characters. The plot dragged on. The acting was poor. I was waiting for the end since the beginning, and that was it. It's a shame that this is the only Dick and Jane that I've read. I thought it was a good book until I reached the end and realized that it didn't have an ending . If you want to have a good time don't read this book . You'll have a bad time too if you read this book .|0
"This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible "" Sarah`s law "" following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud ."|1
A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel `` Waltz into Darkness '' of the writer Cornell Woolrich (a.k.a. Jack Kerouac ) and his son Robert Kerouac . I don't really like the movie as much as it is based on the novel . I don't believe that the movie would be as interesting and interesting if the story of the film was based on real facts . But there are a lot of facts in the novel that can be proven by real evidence . I think the main character of the novel is very interesting .|0
I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos.|1
"I am sure I'm in the minority (I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character (the only other time I liked him at all was in ""A Bug's Life""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real."|1
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though.This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film.|1
"There is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure it was the teacher. In fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. I guess the point of that is that ""rape is omnipresent. You never know who it is going to be"".)"|1
Where do we start with an offering like this ? I nearly said film but that would be going a little too much of the way. We could start with the fact that I am from a family with a long and illustrious tradition of making things for the people. As a child I remember my dad trying to teach my brother how to make a cardboard box to keep food cold in the winter and for our family picnic food for the hot summer days on a table covered in newspaper and a bottle of milk sitting on top of it as a makeshift picnic basket to hold the milk.|0
Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack : I 'd give it ( soundtrack ) a 9 out of 10 but there is so much good stuff on there, I'd give it 9.5/10. I love the music, I don't think it could be any better. I am going to give this movie a 9.9/10. There is just way more of it than I was expecting or really wanting in a film, but oh well. I would give the soundtrack an even higher rating because I love the music and the score and I was hoping to hear more of it in this movie.|0
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary ""Don't Look Now"" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema."|1
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it 's Seattle Film Fest screening , and was blown away by it. For those not in the know, this is an original animated short film, which tells the life and times of a young Japanese girl named Haru. I think this short is beautiful and I have a feeling that I will be able to enjoy it more with time. I am looking forward for more animation films from the animator that created this. I was really happy to see a new piece of work from an artist who has done a lot of amazing animation work already.|0
"Yes sure , this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it . It was just an experiment

I had no issue with the episode. I just wish the writers would have come up with a solution to the cliffhanger at the end. But I'm sure this is only a minor issue. And besides, it's just an episode, it doesn't really matter anyway. But I'm just saying , if they would have come with a solution to it , the episode wouldn't be a rip-off ."|0
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to Hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring!!! The acting in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as though some people from an Evangelic Church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. It wasn't real-life dialog at all.|1
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.|1
"Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric , shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response . This was the film's opening title card :

""It's a tale of two cities."" That line was the only clue we had to understand that ""It's a tale of two cities."" The title is an ambiguous one that implies two things. First, that the story takes place in New York or, if it is set anywhere else, then we are to presume the story is set either in the Big Apple or in an alternate reality that takes place in a city of some description."|0
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH."|1
Take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. So sorry. I really tried to like it.|1
lovely . i just love the movie . i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor . and it is a very funny film . this movie is great . but i dont like the ending . i hate the ending . but i guess i love it . i want to know whats in store with the movie . dont give it a 4 . it is a good movie , but the ending sucks . I love the book and movie. They were sooooo good together! I can't wait for the movie and I hope Rupert gets it in the top 10.|0
"Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed ""victim"" messing the whole set until she finally ""die"". Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina."|1
When the movie first started I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics, I started liking it. The plot was different than anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was, the creatures where only there for a short time. I can only assume this was for money reason.The good side was that the movie was very entertaining.|1
This is a pretty simplistic romance . Girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl finds boy again , girl looses boy again , girl meets girl , girl loves girl , and so on and so on. And all it has is love and a lot of drama . It all sounds pretty good on paper, right ? Well not so much in the way of the love story. This is more of a love triangle with the girl's love triangle being the most important part. This story is all about a girl named Mika and the love that is supposed to grow between this two.|0
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB , as in Bottom of the Barrel . I ca n't figure out what else to say. My point is , this is Crap that should never been put into this game. Why did they make this crap? So they can put more of it in later when you can get it from the shop ? It is not worth buying. I am sure you can do it, but be carefull, as you have no choice in buying it . There are several ways to fix this error and they all involve re-opening the game and restarting .|0
This is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. Added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie.|1
"If you think it 's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with , then I can understand your feeling. But that doesn't make it true and I'm afraid of what will happen to me if I can't get her back. So I want to keep her secret at all cost, until one day...I think I will find the way to get her to accept me with all of the love I'm giving to her now, and I hope to make her my bride for life."" The woman's eyes grew wider and she looked up at me with a confused expression."|0
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie . The way Michael Oliver who now owns that movie has gone on to promote that same movie on TV is unbelievable . What kind of world is this ? How do people in positions of power like Michael Oliver get the idea that they can just do that . What is so wrong with that movie ? What kind of message does this movie give to the world ? How do these people get such power . What a disgrace !!!! I am a fan of Michael Oliver.|0
Until I did a Web search on `` What Alice Found '' , I did n't realize that the name of the book was on the first place I was going to check. Then I did an internet search, and got to this page. Wow! That book was the first one I ever had read. Well, in my case, I only just found it because I have an old friend of mine, who I discovered on Facebook, who was in the very first group of people I joined back in February, 2009.|0
"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it . . . even though it is all over in about ten minutes . . . I thought it was going to be the same old movie I had seen before . . . but this is so much more. The characters in it seem to really care about one another and they get into some pretty heavy situations together that I think make the film more special and more of an ""event"" than a movie . . ."|0
Do not see `` Mr . Magoo . '' It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I have to put it here so people can see for themselves that this is nothing but utter garbage. I did see it, though. I saw it the night it was released. The movie was awful and I didn't care. There was a huge line outside the theater that was only about ten minutes. I saw it and walked by the movie. Then I came out and waited for it to finish so I could get my food and head home.|0
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in . This movie just does not give a rip about what you think it is , its just a cash in , I guess , its just so bad that even the director was embarrassed that they even let it go into the movies . What I would like for the movie to do is show what happens if you are on the wrong side with this drug . Its so sad that the movie makers would take money from all the drug companies and then let it go out for a million or two .|0
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer.|1
At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free his no good brother Claude Akins from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman.Russell kept law and order in Laramie the same way that James Arness did it in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time.|1
Every time I 've seen this movie I get the same impression : some parts of it are so amazingly good that it's a pity I can't make it into a full-length movie. I have to admit my first reaction is usually a big yawn (I find the whole story really boring) but after a while I realise that it's actually quite an impressive and original film. To explain what I mean I'm going to give you a brief idea of the main characters and the events that took place during their lives before meeting up again.|0
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) . Her life falls into disarray when she learns she has only six months to live. In the midst of her despair, she hears about an experimental drug being developed by the government. As she begins to use it, she has visions and receives messages that reveal her destiny. When it is too late to take her medication, and her body is unable to handle the medicine, the Brave One tells her story and shows her a vision of what her life could have been like if she did not succumb to illness.|0
The only reason i did n't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it and didn't need anymore. I'm so sorry that it sucked so bad and had so many flaws. There is no way i can recommend it. It's a must-see. A very good, but not great film. As far as I'm concerned, the only positive thing about it was the music. A lot of it is very good, but I just don't have a taste for that sort of thing.|0
Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film.|1
Helen ( Kate Capshaw ) owns a bookstore in the sleepy , coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea . But she is forced to sell her shop when her father’s death forces her to move to San Francisco with him. Now, she is working as a flight attendant and trying to get by while her father is away. However, things are looking up for her when she finds herself spending more and more time in her hotel room rather than going out. She has a chance to get out on the town, but her mother insists that she go home and help her in the store.|0
"Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films, and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the ""Wanted"" signs. The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene at the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking, as sound is never something you needed with him."|1
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for worst film of all time. A phony looking giant vulture attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. It's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, ""It Came From Hollywood,"" where this gem is hammered for the line, 'A Bird As Big As A Battleship', with gleeful, endless needling."|1
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your films with a guy you can root for, and relate to, if you like your films in black and white, you gotta see this film! Watch it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a beat. It is sometimes slow, and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen, then when the plot begins to unfold, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was!|1
This film gives new meaning to the term `` uneven '' , giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by one or two solid performances from several very talented people. It is so uneven, however, that I can't help but wonder if a more consistent director, one with a more coherent script, or someone with less baggage, would have a little more bite to his film. But I am not about to tell the man who gave me this film to hate; I love this film, and I will go see it again, hopefully with more insight.|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed . From the opening scene , where the characters are being forced to flee a burning building in the face of an approaching military convoy , to the final scenes of the film, when the characters are at their greatest danger yet again, it is obvious that the film was made with the knowledge that the war was coming. As soon as I saw this movie, I knew the film was about to become a very important part of the world's story.|0
"I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine this as even approaching ""stoner classic."" That would be like calling Singles a ""grunge film."" The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected."|1
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales. I feel sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison, and so no more were made. It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. Still, it does at least make Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what doesn't?|1
UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange , necessitating a meticulous read , visually stunning Modernist-flavored crime thriller “I’m Still Here,” his first American feature film since 2006. The story, set during the late ‘80s in Los Angeles’ notorious skid row district, follows a police officer and his wife as they investigate the murder of an aspiring actress who was brutally killed after being discovered strangled in her Los Angeles apartment. “It was a bit of a tough one,” says Alex Frayne, “but one I was very happy with and I knew that I wanted to make.|0
"When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento."|1
"I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. Turns out I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this motion picture like Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds to being a burnout. Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW). Like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention!"|1
"Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.To break Julie's ""goody two shoes mold"" she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction.The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy."|1
This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England.|1
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids . Spanky and the gang decide to help him out and ask all the grown ups to have a little froggie party , so they can see how everyone is going to be having a great time . As the night approaches , everyone except Froggie is having the biggest party . They decide to invite all the children , so everyone can have a good time . When the party starts , the grown ups get mad when Froggie and his friends don't show up .|0
"As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the ""Millennium"" series) and of course Lorenzo ""Renegade"" Lamas, I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film. Sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. Sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from Microsoft Flight Simulator.The cinematography sucks as well. Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look."|1
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive , which was a very good film in the low budget indie world. That film got a lot of people excited for the sequel and I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone complain about it that it wasn’t at all good. In Crash Dive 2 , though, the writing is worse than the film, the directing worse and the acting worse. For starters, instead of having two leads, it has a single lead. I’m not joking.|0
I 'm not really sure where to begin . From start to finish , bad , stinky bad , like a car wash , was a nightmare . The worst part of it all is they gave me so many choices and told me to make my decision after the tour . I mean , you think you got a choice in this place ? I guess it's like going to the grocery store and telling me to chose what I want . I mean I thought I did a great job . They said if I liked the food I could go and choose from the other options .|0
The film is a joy to watch , not just for the plot , which is gripping , but also because of the superb cast and their fine chemistry , especially Nayanthara, who steals the show for sure. There is the usual dose of melodrama here and there , but thankfully it’s not overdone. The film is full of action , drama and romance , the last two being the most compelling. However, while the film does have moments that could have been better , it’s not all bad and I would highly recommend the movie .|0
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan, I collect his movies and so far has get to 60. But I´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. But hey that´s why I like him - he is entertaining.But this one has to take the price, I can´t stop wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and also Corbin Bernsen to the picture.While Bernsen is plain awful (I really don´t like him), Roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn´t mean much).|1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own . It is a story of inspiration and family. It is beautifully crafted and a joy to watch. I highly recommend this to anyone. It has everything you need to make an amazing movie that is enjoyable for the entire family to see. I watched this movie again and again with my grandchildren. I can’t tell you how much fun it was watching them watch it. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It is a very touching and emotional story and the actors in this film were amazing.|0
"Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's bad enough I wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time I lost that I could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually lost a few IQ points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing ""work""! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time."|1
"Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with it, this movie has a very funny cast, with the three lead actors from ""The Best Man."" It's a movie that will make you laugh till you cry, and if you love classic comedies then this movie is definitely one of your favorites! Sally Field is as funny as she has been in her whole life. She plays a girl named Betty who has to marry her first cousin and she gets her cousin to take her to the altar as her date."|0
Sure , most of the slasher films of the 1980 's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on , the same is true for the 1980' films of the 70' s such as The Exorcist or Alien or even Alien Resurrection , i do not think it is wise to compare them to the films of the 80' s , there are a lot of good and bad horror films that were made in that decade, but they all deserve to be viewed on their own merits and not based on how they fit into that decade of horror movies or were made by a certain director.|0
The plot for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the Phillipines. One Black, and one White. These two women, are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the Phillipines and assume a better life.|1
I just watched this , an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his `` glasses '' character on Kino . I'm not going to spoil anything, but I just wanted to mention a great, great film. This one's got some great comedy elements to it as well. Harold Lloyd, the great one, as the narrator tells us about what's happening in his life. But as a lot of things in his world, it's pretty dreary. You know that the guy loves life, loves his work and wants to be loved by the best people, and that he's a genius.|0
This was shown on a premium channel , so I did n't realise it was made for TV . Even with that it would have been better to get it made in colour rather than black and white , this would have allowed it to stand out more. I do like the design though , although I do wish it would have been more animated . But I understand that was a budget issue, and a lot of the film was shot as a live action short . Overall a nice little animation with a good story and some good visuals !|0
With its ww2 timing , falling in and out of love , and easy on the eye Kira , this film has been the one of the top movies in the box office since it came out. This movie takes a look back at a period of time which is really interesting to me. A period that I feel that we as an american community has a lot to be proud of. I have come to the point that I really love this country and the people in it. And I don't want to take it back, like some of the other movies on this list do.|0
I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie, because she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There both really stupid and just terrible actors.|1
Well , that was sure a waste of Dave McKean 's talents , was n't it ? Do n't get the wrong idea , because Dave's got a good story or two to tell, n' all the rest of us have 'nuff of that stuff at this point . He's got a new show up on Netflix , and he's also got a book in the works . And , if I'm not mistaken , he also got another TV show in the works , which is also set in Texas . So , we'll see if this is just a temporary setback for McKean , or a permanent one .|0
One should not be too critical about the director 's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba .I liked the film a lot. It is one that should be seen. The script is pretty good, not so good. It is good enough to give Madiba the Oscar. But he should have given the screenplay to the screenwriter of The Bridge on the River Kwai , which is a far better script, because that is what it is. I am glad that the movie has got so much success, so I can watch it twice, because it is a great movie .|0
Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this film is horrible.William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do.The film's setup is way too long.|1
Did people expect `` Jurassic Park 3 '' to be full of surprises ? Not one moment of it is. That's why they're called surprise 'sequels'. It is a fact that all three films are the same. It would take all three films over a weekend to change any aspect of this movie, except for the last few minutes where the dinosaurs come out to play, which is totally predictable, but good. What I found most surprising is the last few minutes, where all the survivors are reunited, and are united in a common goal to take back the island from the dinosaurs.|0
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.Where does this film go wrong?|1
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen . At first i thought that it was going to be good movie . But after that,i realized that this movie is not a good movie. This movie was just a waste of time . I have watched this movie more than a thousand times. It is amazing! The story is very realistic and you feel a part of the story from the beginning till the end. The acting was so realistic that when I was watching the movie for more than an hour, I could feel the stress from the actors and the director.|0
I 'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n't be accused of unfair bias. Not only is it a wonderful, heart-pounding action sequence, but you'll notice it also includes some moments of beautiful, intimate cinematography. You can stream the film on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube, so you can watch it at your leisure. I recommend the latter two, especially if you are a movie buff (like me). You may want to check out some of the previous episodes of the series, like the first two episodes.|0
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw , however I’m fairly certain that the film I saw wasn’t any old movie. In fact it was a copy of the film that was made during one of the most significant periods in the film industry history, The Golden Age. The Golden Age occurred between the 1930s, when films had a mass appeal to the general public. In fact The Golden Age actually began with the silent film era in 1915 and ran through into 1932.|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy , but also the best of the trilogy. It is so well shot and edited that I found myself holding back on the tears. There are many scenes in this film where the camera is not just a prop but it’s very own character. From the opening shots to the final one, it’s a true masterpiece. You can read our review here and our thoughts here . But, for this review I want to go into it from an entirely different perspective and show you the entire film in one paragraph .|0
In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree.|1
"After the failure of ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth,"" the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs UNDER 90 minutes... On display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched B-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while STILL attempting to keep the whole project completely serious."|1
"oh well ... its funny . should have been a sadistic comedy , a lot of horror movies lack common sense . but then again , most of it is not my favorite horror movies in any case . this was a very enjoyable watch and it would be interesting to know if there was a sequel . hope so , it had the potential to be something very unique and enjoyable , even for those who hated the first movie . so , what did you think , did you enjoy it ? did you love it ? and will it get another sequel , 
if yes , please do let us know the title ."|0
"I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.This is an ""A"" movie and I recommend it highly. If you liked ""1984"" book or movie, I think you will like this one as well.This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach."|1
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago , and it is now making a comeback. I have to say, if I ever have to read an essay from a guy who doesn't have a clue about economics, I will write him off as an idiot. Of course he would be an idiot, that's the point. Any idiot knows that if he doesn't have a clue about economics, it's because he's trying to make up for it by being a know-it-all with a degree in Economics. He won't know how the system works.|0
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time when films didn’t seem so dark and serious. It’s so easy to dismiss this kind of film, I’ll have to admit, when the subject is one we all can relate to; but this film is one of those I really wish I had seen earlier (if I had, it would have been far better). This film, written and directed by John Boorman, has won many awards.|0
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie . You people encouraged it and even gave it a bad rap. You liked it. And if you liked it so much, you’d never think that it could ever be used as a basis for a movie like The Hangover — and I don’t think The Hangover could have been made without that movie, by the way. And the same for The Hangover Part II. And it’d never have been made had the movie not been available.|0
"Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 ( may be overall too ) if it hadn't been in an ""R"" rated, PG film category. It is a low budget film, which makes it all the more surprising to see an R and an A in the film's cast. I thought it would have a little more traction at the box office. In any case, I will watch it soon, but I'm not holding out hope that a sequel/prequel or remake might come about."|0
I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What were you thinking making three hours out of it? It may have a quite good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. It didn't have anything.It's got this strange, crazy science man with Einstein-hair, the classic thing. Not real at all. And a man keep getting younger all the time.|1
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner ' .. I guess I could be wrong, but I don't see this as a bad movie. For a while, it seemed like the movie was going in a totally wrong direction as I watched, but then it was all right, and finally I couldn't tell where it was going, and that made me more confused than the beginning of the movie. It is hard to get to know this movie without knowing the original plot.|0
`` Love Life '' explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a straight woman. The film begins with a montage of images of women dressed in the Victorian costume of their time. The film shows that in Victorian times women were supposed to wear a corset, and this is one of several references to sexuality and sexuality in general throughout the film. The film shows that it is possible to be attracted to women of all races and ethnic groups, but this is only possible if the men are of their own race or if the woman is a white woman.|0
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto one of the boats that takes them back to the mainland. What he finds out about the mysterious beast is not what he expected, and what comes next changes everything for him. I have never been to Jamaica before but I've been to St. Barts a few times and have always had a good time. Last time I visited I stayed in a villa on Paradise Island, which is really the only island that I know of that has an actual beach.|0
Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now!Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was acted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually.Over the years, I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would, by coincidence? Anyway, it's yet an old story. I saw it a short while ago.|1
"I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. I remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family.Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like ""this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid..."|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. It´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.|1
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan . Now, I am a bit more than a little skeptical about his acting abilities and this is not the kind of movie where I can take him seriously. But, this is the type of film I watch to escape the reality of daily life and I have to admit, it was a pretty good escape . Story : The film is based on the novel “In the Heat of the Day” by James M. Cain, which is a historical novel that was published in 1953.|0
"Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like ""The Avengers"" and the remake of ""Diabolique"" has directed this ripoff of the Die Hard concept, done on - what looks like - a Blair Witch budget. A California nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't Arab; they're really disgruntled American soldiers masquerading as Arabs! We find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. We're not sure what the statement is but never mind."|1
I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say , `` Ben Johnson ? ! '' - he was a good hockey player, but he didn't score enough goals, didn't fight enough and didn't win too many fights. - That's why we elected him, as Prime Minister, to lead the country. - And the country elected him as a member of parliament to be their Prime Minister, because we elected him as a member of parliament who had the courage and conviction to say we will fight to win and he has the courage and conviction to say we will fight to win.|0
Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success `` The Gay Divorce '' ( a title which was considered too scandalous to be used, hence the `Gay Divorce' ) was handled by the film's producer, Irwin Winkler (no relation, of course). The screenplay was written by Robert Asahina. Winkler and director John Huston were involved from the beginning. The budget was not high, $200,000 for two weeks in New York City, plus the expense of travel to San Francisco. At the studio, the first thing to do was to decide who should direct this film.|0
Wow , this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends . If you have had a crap day and just need something fun to laugh at , give this a look . It’s that good ! This is a pretty good show in my honest opinion. The writing is great, the music is very good and the premise is clever. What I like about the show is that it seems to be set in a time in which there’s so few shows like this in the United States anymore, and yet it continues to have that quality to it.|0
Okay , enough . Every time I think I 've seen a film that is so misbegotten , so bad it makes me ill , I think I 've seen it . You 're the first director ever to make this film . It's not only a masterpiece , it 's a masterpiece with style . I don't think any film ever has had such a unique vision . I don't think there's another film with this level of style , or this level of substance . It's an absolute treat . It'll take a few hours to watch it .|0
I'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although because of the poor story flow, I'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. The story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on.|1
This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride!|1
I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.I am grading this not even as a regular film,but as a T&A film,and this is the worst,lamest,crappiest and most awful movie i've seen.the acting,story and music are all terrible,not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the T&A connisuer.it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost!|1
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film. Trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.There were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and Kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. This just looked like filler.Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and seeing an IBM techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it.|1
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture ( if you may consider it that, or even not ) may well be the very same. The very first time i saw this film , I was at a friends place and saw it. I had not really heard of it, but at that time it was very fresh. I didn't know anything about it and watched it the next day. I felt a really strange feeling inside, i was shocked by it and thought, what i did not know?|0
William Petersen (that C.S.I guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. It leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or a pick up at the library but not much more.|1
"It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. Bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. He was quietly moving in the TV movie ""Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus"" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed ""The Indian Runner"".In ""The Evil That Men Do"", however, Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns."|1
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And a more off-the-wall storyline too!A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed.|1
I 'm sorry , but I can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought they were, or what they were doing , or even what is the purpose of life, or anything like that. Some of us think it is because you can not read or see what people are thinking about, but you can still understand what they really feel. So I am writing this so we can start a dialogue, and you will be surprised with what you will learn about yourself, how your thoughts are influenced by how others see you, and how you look at everything.|0
"Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [ # 4/10 ] , with atmospheric almost noirish black and white artwork. As with most entries, this one has a little something for everyone - action, romance, adventure, murder and more - all wrapped up with a well-done story, and a good enough ending to make it at least an entertaining read. I am a bit sad, that this entry is only a 2/10, as it's such a gem in my bookshelf. [ #1/10]

A pretty decent entry, but not a classic - more like a good, but not all-out classic."|0
Mr Bean was great fun , i loved it , every episode was really funny , Rowan Atkinson was perfect in the lead role , and it would be a crime to replace him with someone else , especially since Atkinson is British . It had everything , from comedy , to romance , to drama , a very funny story , great acting , some great acting performances from a great actor , great music , a very interesting and exciting story , a very happy ending , well worth watching and i would love to see Rowan in another series , it was the perfect summer tv show .|0
What on earth happened to RGV ? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to have seen it in order to understand how bad it was. Let’s begin with the acting. The characters are so over-acted that I don’t blame the director at all. The actors were good enough to give the movie a good shot in the arm, but once the plot got going, the show went down the drain. One could forgive the actors for a good performance here and there, but over all they just gave this movie a negative review.|0
"What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's ""madness"" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction."|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe I have ever seen.Completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - The entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movieMany people left halfway - Can't blame them... I stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and I wish I'd left.|1
"This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying ""everyone has a box"" which he put his personal things into."|1
Oh how awfully this movie is ! I do n't know if it is a horror film or a drama film... I was a little bit confused at first when I was watching this movie for the first time and then I understood it... I enjoyed this movie very very much... I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I've ever watch... and that's it for now I hope you'll enjoy watching this movie and I'll give you a review in the next day or two of this movie....|0
This movie has to be the worst film I have seen . There is a reason it was made to be a sequel and I hope it is because the original was good . I really wanted to like it but I couldn't . The cast is great with the likes of Tom Hanks and Steve Martin . I wish I could say the plot was good . The story is just all wrong . I didn't hate the movie and I am still enjoying it . It is not bad at all and it is a great movie .|0
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild ' is a dull slasher flick . Yes , it have some good point ,but I just can't imagine that it is more than it is. This movie just plain sucks, with no redeeming qualities. If I had to make a list on it's merits, it'd probably be:1) The gore is decent2) The kills are not as cool as the ones in The Crow3) The characters are annoying4) The special effects are not great5) The ending is not satisfying. And that is probably a short list of things I hated about the film.|0
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.|1
`` Scientists at a remote lab experiment on ( insert scaly creature here ) and create out of control monsters. Scientists discover a mysterious alien race that can take over the planet and kill the populace in a matter of days. The aliens are eventually defeated by a team of scientists working in concert. The movie ends on a positive note when the alien race is wiped out and a human race is created. The movie has no real plot, just a bunch of plot twists and turns involving aliens, government conspiracies, and super cool alien monster creatures. 3.|0
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not , admittedly , all that original . Young lovers are reunited with the man of their lives, the man who has gone missing in the woods . It is a story of love, heartbreak, survival, and a whole lotta blood and guts . It is the story of my life and I am telling it all . But the truth is not all that compelling. There's a lot of heartache, but only a few tears. Saturday, October 24, 2008

I'm trying to think up something to blog about ."|0
the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing...|1
I love Ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. And the photography is quiet nice. We put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. When we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. About halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little.|1
To paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard Moe and Larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant.|1
"Oh , my . Oh , this is a * really * bad movie . The acting is absolutely atrocious and the editing is horrible . The plot has * absolutely * no * sense . * The only * real * part * of this movie is that * you . *

I'm a Christian, and I have watched pretty of Christian movies, but this one is too bad. They try to make this good, but it's too hard for them I think.- You can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. I think there will be a lot more of them.- The quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. The story is not so very bad, but could've been better.|1
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not equaled today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer.Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of his mystique. Hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image.|1
This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old `` cons turn good '' yarn , which we have all seen before , and is more than a little embarrassing for someone trying to get a career started as a professional writer . There are several issues with this story and it would be good to see the author re-examine what they have written for the last time and take the time and make some changes. One of the biggest issues I have with the story is that it is not clear to the reader why the police were interested in this case.|0
Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour ? The only thing I see wrong with these spoof films is that they are based on a TV show of some sort. No one is saying these films have to be realistic, but that they don't have TOO much to rely upon, and that to a large extent, the humour is pure stupid. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing because they could be just as realistic, but they wouldn't necessarily be funny.|0
"I will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. Even at the young age I remember thinking, ""This is a Baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. The girls in bathing suits."" Nonetheless I was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! As a thirteen year old I never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously."|1
Well , after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING , I went into the film expecting nothing special. However after watching it I got a new found appreciation and I found it to be absolutely amazing. The film is as beautiful as I could have expected from it's trailer . I can't recommend this movie highly enough. There are some parts that are not for everyone, but overall you won't regret watching it at all. For those who don't have much knowledge of Bollywood, you will absolutely have a different view after watching this one.|0
If you just want gore , and nothing but gore and torture , you 've come to the right movie. The torture sequence alone can't be topped for sheer intensity. The torture scenes are so bloody , and violent , and graphic that it's not even funny. When the main characters escape , they take the only weapon on their side , and they've got it pointed right at their torturer. It's a bloody mess. The only good thing I can think of about this movie is how bloody it is. This is a really, really good film.|0
Okay it is terribly , and I mean terribly , easy to pick apart this film . C'mmon what do we have to lose ? I just want to get past that and get to the meat of it ! At least not in such a stupid way ! This film, is like a very simple puzzle where you try to put as many pieces together as you possibly can in a way that you are sure it makes perfect sense at the end. This way it doesn't lose you in a haze of logic, and you have an idea of where you might go with the puzzle at the end .|0
What can I say about a movie as bad as this? The people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in.|1
I think `` category 6 : day of destruction '' was very unrealistic . The digital effects where like a dream and they were beautiful . Very very talented . I hope this game will get a sequel as well . Very much hope that it will be more realistic as the last one was . As well I want it to be made by the same people and I know they will make the game . I will be the first to back the team for the game as I know they will do a great job . I know I will get a sequel but I hope it does not end like the last one did .|0
"Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V . movie based on the Peter Kurth novel ""Anna and the Greek"". The plot involved a beautiful woman named Anna who left her husband to go off to college and fall in with a group of men. After several encounters with them Anna begins to feel like she's part of something, something she couldn't even imagine as a girl, but then she realizes it's something a lot bigger then her little fantasy and decides to make her own way as she goes to college and finds herself getting involved with a very large group of men."|0
"Now I 'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so this was the one I had been looking for! I was drawn into the world and was amazed to learn that there are more than 100,000 stops made each year on a professional studio set. There are a couple of issues I had with this program:

I had an issue of the program freezing up. It took me a while to figure out why. I was able to figure out what was happening by doing a bit of research, but not all of it, but enough to know what was happening."|0
First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like cliché'e version of gangsters.The movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters.|1
When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory.|1
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957 . In fact , despite Ed Wood , Jr.and his dreadful dialogue and acting , it may be the worst sci-fi film in the history of film . Ed Wood, Jr . (played by Alan Ladd) is the owner of a local cinema and is trying to run a business . He’s a successful businessman and he has to find a suitable movie to show a couple of young couples . Ed and his partner Bill (Lloyd Hughes) go into the cinema every Friday night with their wives and children .|0
See Three Colors : Blue and Three Colors : White . They are both wonderful films and will give an excellent introduction to the color theory. What I liked in these films is that the two films have so much to offer that they will give the audience something different. One film which I liked very much was, Three Colors : Blue, and the other one which I liked less is Two Colors : Blue. The one film which was disappointing is, Color of the Wind. In Color of the Wind, the colors don't go together well at all.|0
This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and I want to die' garbage. But the movies from the 80's are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!|1
Rififi , directed by Jules Dassin , is in line with the Melville crime pictures ( particularly Bob le Flameur ) because of its central character , a detective played by Richard Widmark who is also a poet. The movie is in part a mystery story but has more depth to it with Widmark himself taking center stage and a strong cast that also includes George Sanders as his partner in the homicide squad. George Sanders stars as Detective Rififi , the lead detective on the police force in the small fictional city of Los Angeles. The story of the movie is centered around the characters and themes of grief and death.|0
This movie is great . 80 's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse , so they are born into a world of vampires . There is also a big plot twist that you don't get in the film . It takes place during a time when the vampire world is about to be destroyed and the kids have the ability to see into the future with a human eye , but are still afraid to use the power . They use it to watch over people and try to stop the vampires . The movie is very good with the actors .|0
I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver . The screen was three rows in front of me , and it only took 30 minutes. It is an incredible film, and I was extremely impressed. The story is about a man and woman who have been in love and are now married. The man is a cop, and has just been fired after a drug bust. He lives with his ex-wife, and his daughter. One day he goes into the bar where his old girlfriend lives. He tells her he's going back to his ex.|0
First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie.|1
"Yes, it's a SBIF (So Bad It's Funny) classic. With a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely NO even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! Camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. Blood looked like watered-down cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the ""human"" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide.Did ANYONE involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was?"|1
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well . Compared to western films, I have seen a very small range of Japanese films. What I have enjoyed the most is watching some of the Japanese films that I have seen. These are mostly films that were made by Japanese directors and have a lot of action, but I have to say that I have not yet found a Japanese film that is all action. That said, Kurosawa has not been one of these directors. He has been an interesting one.|0
A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul . Some , a handful . Others , a little more . You see , every character has a bit of every actor . And then some . And many others . Each of which have a few more roles . I’m sure you’re thinking . What was this guy doing in this movie? He has a few good film roles , and he also has a smattering of roles that he is pretty decent in , so why did he end up playing this role? This is what I think .|0
I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series.|1
"i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen . 219 minutes passed and yet it was so much fun that my eyes just kept moving back and forward watching it. It’s hard to describe and it is so hard to put into words, but here is some of my thoughts:

The music was so good that I had a feeling of being at a party in a club (I am not usually a music fan) and not really caring about anything. I was feeling happy and that was so much better than anything else I was listening to."|0
`` Solomon and Sheba '' was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the early '70s. It was a brilliant, witty, funny film that had the audience in stitches, and was a huge hit at the time. As far as cult movies go, this is probably the second most cult, and certainly the most underrated. What is your favorite movie from the 50's & 60's ? I like a lot of those movies too, but some of the greatest of all time are the 1950's and '60's.|0
This is one of my 3 favorite movies . I 've been out on the water since I was 13 years old and this is the first time that my son and I have ever been to a movie together . It was also the first movie of my son . He was so into it , and it was the first time he had ever seen me in anything , so it was very sweet of him to come out and watch and enjoy the movie with me . As I mentioned before , this was the first time we 've been to a movie since we've been out on the water .|0
I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work.The plot is a mixing of Stephen Hawking's Book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends, and Hawkings himself.Don't be fooled; It totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. The blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man.|1
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin. This is a low grade B feature that should have went straight to video. The violence is vicious and gory, but actually quite mild. The story line is so weak and dialogue so haphazard it is hard to work up much interest. Eileen Daly is the lead character Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth, and Isabel Brook.|1
Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence.|1
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. He hides out in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles.|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper . No respect whatsoever to many other artists who have written or produced their best work on the walls of the Louvre, the Sistine Chapel, etc. I was in Paris recently. And while walking down La Rue de la Verrerie I came upon an exhibit of the Monet paintings in an old building called the Maison Vauquer. At first, I thought, oh, that must be where Monet came to paint in his 30's when he moved from his native Normandy.|0
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered up to standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and, the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to he girl, so guess what?! Then the final after-twist I do not know what to think of that.|1
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.|1
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes.|1
For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. If each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love.|1
You know , this is one of those `` Emperor 's New Clothes '' films . It 's like , '' I 'm the hero of this film '' and I can walk anywhere I want . I am the film 's hero . And I can '' walk anywhere'' I want. I think it 's because this is a movie that takes a lot of liberties. It's like , there 's a few things that you don't see. And they're very clever and very funny. I don't know if you realize that . I'm not even sure I know where I am .|0
Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like `` The Avengers '' and the remake of `` Diabolique. '' The filmmaker is currently in post-production with his new movie, `` The Conjuring 2. '' Checheck recently told THR, `` I will be filming my next movie right here in the Bay Area. And I think I'm going to tell my story about that movie, because it's so amazing. We're talking about something that is just, to me, something very different. It's hard to describe what it is, but it's so different.|0
The title , although singular , will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning 's immortal classic about a family of four who go missing in a Louisiana swamp. While it might sound like pure fantasy, a true horror-story, the movie actually takes place in a fictional town named Bordeaux in the Southwestern United States, which actually takes place in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas. So what's the real story about the movie? It's actually based on a novel about a young couple whose young son ends up dying mysteriously during an attempted suicide.|0
[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it.|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old . Robert Sacchi nails it. In the opening sequence, he shows how the movie was made. There is also great use of music in the movie. You don’t have to be good at film making to do the movie. If you are, watch the TV series. This movie does not require a special knowledge about film to enjoy the film. It shows you how the film maker did his job. It shows you the craft that made this movie.|0
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry , a charming young woman becomes a vampire . Not only is she torn between two men, but also between the life of a free-spirited woman and a cold-blooded vampire. My Review: This is another story of a vampire. This time however it is a teenage vampire. There are no super heroes involved here. This story is really good. It gives the reader information that the readers would not have known before. For instance, we are told that this vampire is a werewolf as well, not just a vampire .|0
Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the rabbit's hole. So Bug's has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one, if still shorn of a classic.|1
"A CBS radio program entitled ""We the People"" assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who is ""studying"" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Ms. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. Immediately."|1
This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, Tobias Wolff.Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, I won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself.|1
"If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on Cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you ARE on the Internet, after all).But whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH ""CHE!"". Unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.All the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave ""Che!"" their vote for worst film of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this travesty?"|1
"There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. ""Meatballs"" was a leader. And here's one of its followers. ""Party Camp"" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that ""Meatballs"" (the original) had so successfully mined. Of course, that one had Bill Murray. So, what does ""Party Camp"" have?I'm glad you asked that question.Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish SHE provides!"|1
I saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and I didn't know where it had come from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here at IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is great, I believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. And the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining.|1
"I just found out before writing this review that ""Komodo vs. Cobra"" and another movie called ""Curse of the Komodo"" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. That might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. They both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. What differences are there?"|1
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. On the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.I'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi.I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised.|1
`` Delusion '' is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile . . . but what you experienced is actually just a lot of fun and a good-looking movie. Don't watch '' without being fully aware of what exactly '' is happening and where the scenes are going. '' In short, '' is not what '' is. It can be a '' good-looking film . . . but only when you know what it is . . . what it is, is an easy-to-grind '' low-class movie. The same is true of '', too .|0
In 1895 , in a small village in Japan , the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo ( Takahiro Tamura ), who was also the mayor of this village, was raped and murdered. The murderer fled to the United States and killed his wife's father, then raped and murdered his daughter-in-law. After a long investigation , the Japanese police arrested Gisaburo. On December 12, 1896, Gisaburo was found guilty of the crimes committed by the murderer . He was arrested, sent to prison, and tried twice, with each conviction being overturned.|0
OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. But when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched Ghost Lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. The story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop.|1
"This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the ""gallant"" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha! )The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. And I liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well."|1
". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice , bouncy jugs in the water."" ""How much more do I have to take from them?"" ""We're gonna go out and bring them back, but you got to understand the way it's gonna be."" ""What's going to happen?"" ""What's gonna happen."" ""Are you with us, or against us?"" ""What do we do?"" ""Okay, I'm with you."""|0
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. The characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems.|1
"I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of ""five stars!"" on that Attack of the Show show. Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie."|1
As I looked at this movie once again, I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. It has the gripping ending, the deranged murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great on-location shots, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies.|1
"This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. It is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. And that comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so flipping bad, it made ""Hulk"" (The second worst movie ever) look like ""The Departed"" (One of the greatest movies in cinematic history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie."|1
"The horrific production doesn't qualify as a ""film."" It was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! There is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a ZERO!The plot is contrived and ridiculous. A late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? PLEASE!"|1
25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have been a fan of his since the 1950's. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me quite a bit. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery.|1
I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before.|1
"This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the DVD at the video store and think ""why not"". Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) at how good it was and how much I enjoyed it.Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it."|1
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. It's just that there is nothing of interest in this film. There are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle.|1
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust . Well , parts of the Earth , because somewhere in Italy , there is a huge nuclear power plant , that produces enough energy to destroy all the planets in the universe. So, what happens next? Well , one of the scientists at the power plant has an accident. He loses his memory, so he goes mad and he starts to kill everyone, including himself, because he believes he's the only one with the power to restore order. But , there are those who believe that there is a man who could help restore order.|0
If you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. I understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature... no small feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end).|1
Peter Strauss , by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of the credit for inventing the idea of a modern American television drama. So it was surprising, when this week's Sunday Times magazine announced that his name had been added to its list of the most influential television producers of the last 20 years. It should have been a shock, too, since his name has been the butt of the joke for years, and his career has been dogged by controversies and accusations that have made it seem as if his show The Wire had been ripped off or stolen outright.|0
"This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who , as a child , specifically asked for something because it was just ‘better’. From the time of birth until the time of graduation, I was asked:

“Can I have something for X/Y and Z?”

It went like this:

My parents said: “It’s your first day at school. Go get your backpack and eat lunch. When you get home, you’ll be fine.”

That is, until the time of my graduation."|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen . this is slow , plot less , unoriginal , and the ending is so terrible . its like it was made for kids . i can honestly say i wont be watching this . i thought that this movie was great and i was hoping it would get a 4.5/5 because the trailer was awesome. i was pleasantly surprised because the movie actually wasn't as bad as i thought . the movie actually was quite good because it actually had a good plot which i really liked and the action scenes were awesome .|0
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's first shot at mainstream acceptance . In a turbulent career spanning eight decades, the legendary director made his name, in part, by subverting the mainstream. His first two films—both from the 1970s—dealt with social issues of the day. But, in the midst of the political and moral turmoil of the Cold War, his third film, released in 1987, offered a unique portrait of what it meant to be a successful family man in communist-dominated East Germany. And his fourth feature, released in 2002, was his first major hit in America—and the first he made in color.|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie. The only problem is it isn't very well done.My brain is still insulted from the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala The Weather Channels commercials. Why would watching local news footage of a washed out side-street give insight to global weather patterns? You got me.Also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man.|1
I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed. The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it.|1
"Wealthy businessman's daughter, who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath, discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by daddy (whom she affectionately refers to as ""Darling""); worse than that, she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live, leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's screenplay (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot, which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk."|1
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who dally with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually come up short. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.|1
"The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack , their choices and viewpoints. So you are stuck between the two, trying to be Tru and Jack. Or is there a third choice? __________________

My first post at the IMDb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. It doesn't make any sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. I could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rental.|1
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me . The cast was beautiful , lovely to watch in all of the movies and the characters were all well developed. This was a fun movie. I loved it . The acting is great and the story line is really well done . It was a great cast , but I had a problem with one of the girls . I saw her on many of the episodes and in one episode she had her eyes crossed. That was annoying to me . She was the best in that episode too.|0
"Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel , combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés , and the result is a classic-in-short-order flick that's so rotten-to-the-stomach you could cut it with a razor blade and make sushi. ""I'll take a bottle of aspirin and then we can have sex,"" my sister says to her boyfriend one day. ""I'm tired of you trying to sleep all the time. It's not natural for us to always sleep in the same bed. We have a double-wide, remember? It'll only be a second, let's do it already."""|0
Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short.|1
If you enjoy riddles and suspense , you will enjoy this movie . Truth be told it was mostly the riddles and suspense i liked . The problem was the acting . It just wasn't that great . It's an American classic. In the film, a young American soldier is trapped in a German prison camp after being captured. While in prison the prisoner falls in love with a girl from a nearby village. His commanding officer decides that the prisoner can't return to his unit until he has completed a mission. It's an American classic, in fact it was a major influence for my love of movies.|0
Yep . Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled . The 80 's were the last good times for cartoons, at least they seemed that way until this last decade . I don't remember the 80 's as a great time , I grew up watching them and they were good times but I'm not sure I'll ever have another one like that in my life again . I was lucky in one way when I lived in England and I grew up in the city . I could always go out to the city and have my choice of shows and events .|0
"I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those ""make you squirm"" buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a disspointment."|1
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Hopkins. Now, in fairness to Hopkins, the review was written with the benefit of hindsight: Hopkins had just played a part that required a lot of physical action, and Vaughn had the time to train. Still, it's hard for a reviewer to believe that Hopkins would be so much better than Vaughn. I can't help but feel that, deep down, Hopkins is a better actor than most people.|0
"My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. Blame that on shows like ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series."|1
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana , 1927 's Sur un Air de Charleston is now in the collection at the National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution. Its subject was an airship that was used by Confederate soldiers to scout ahead of the Union forces in the war for southern independence from the North. It was one of dozens of such airships made for the Confederate States Army but it was destroyed during the war when one of its propellers malfunctioned. According to the curator of the Smithsonian, the film has not been shown to the general public.|0
Oh boy. Where do I begin on this piece of slime? This is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that I've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...For the first thing, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot.|1
Piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . I thought it would end in some kind of climax where they were all destroyed and we'd see a new race rise up from the ashes , but this was just a story about white saviors defeating black saviors , with black saviors being killed and the land being repopulated from the ashes of white savagers. If anything, it just made the world bigger than what we'd ever seen before. I have to agree with the comment that this movie was a boring mess that wasn't interesting at all .|0
Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it.|1
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual `` horror '' movie again . I had been disappointed with her role in '' Back to the Future 2 '' because she really did not seem to like acting in movies , but now she plays the villainess in the new `` horror'' movie, '' The Omen: Legion of the Dead , '' which opens Friday, August 28, at the AMC Empire 25 in Manhattan. You remember that movie, don''t you? The Omen is an American film adaptation of the horror novel '' Omen: The Final Cut, '' by American author C.C.|0
"If you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (I guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! The plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the ""actors"" can sleep at night! It's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and I highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something."|1
"This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV performances and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work. There's even a few shots from ""Son Of Dracula"". This movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed."|1

Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow.|1
Jim Henson 's The Muppet Movie is a charming , funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed on the big screen too. It has some really good music and a great theme song. I don't know what it is about this movie but it really doesn't seem like a movie that is just for kids, or kids at all for that matter. It is for everybody. It is also a very mature movie with some adult themes but I don't mind at all that this is a kids movie.|0
This movie did n't do it for me , an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years . Jamie Dornan plays the part of Willy Loman with a rare talent for delivering one-liners of a lifetime . The movie also features a terrific performance from Michael Douglas who plays Arthur Miller . The script was excellent but the story left a sour aftertaste . You do not want this movie to leave you , but if you do not need this movie to make you a fan of the character . The movie is not that bad but it is not the best either . The acting is superb .|0
I watched this movie the other night , and I have to admit , it was quite possibly the best movie I’ve ever seen. It was a perfect combination of art , science, and comedy with a very touching story line and brilliant performances from the actors in the movie . When I first saw the movie , I was a little bit skeptical . I wasn’t sure how they could pull this off . How did they take a movie with such a small budget and make it a film so touching , funny, and well acted ?|0

I really enjoyed this movie . I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it . I've watched this movie with my parents, siblings, boyfriends, girlfriends, and friends. It's a fun movie . The plot is really good and the story is a great blend of action and drama and comedy . This movie is definitely a movie worth watching . This is a really good movie and I recommend it to everyone . The plot is good and there are a lot of funny moments throughout the movie . I like how it has a good mix of action and drama .|0
It 's true , no one really expects anything from sequels . But even by that low standard this is the best sequel since the original Star Wars. It 's definitely a step-up from Empire , and I can 't wait to see it on Blu-Ray so I can hear what they did to the soundtrack . And even better news is I 'll be seeing it at midnight on May 4, the same day George Lucas and George Lucas-owned Lucasfilm opens their new movie theatre in San Francisco . So I'll be there and I'll bring my own copy of the new movie as a reward for showing up to the midnight premiere.|0
` The Last Frontier ' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jedediah Smith and Billy The Kid as heroes against a series of lawless bandits. With the addition of an entertaining score by John Williams that blends traditional Western music with jazz, the film is bound to please fans of the genre who have not been disappointed by its predecessors. On his first trip to the Western Front, Jedediah returns with a friend to the home of the infamous Billy the Kid and his brothers, but is unable to learn the truth behind his father's past.|0
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain though, because (unless you've seen this) I bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (That's the original part-not good or bad, just there)! Let me say that I have seen every comedian appearing in a main role, and like them all. That's what makes this such a mystery. The supporting leads are actually acting (although the dialog is bad). The only character that is fairly good is the one played by John Goodman.|1
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. Apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst.|1
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting, there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.Anyway...I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it.|1
We all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. But Raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless Carnosaur series, does not even ATTEMPT to have any enjoyment in it. Its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. Where do we start? Well... the sets are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages.|1
Where do I begin ? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features -- it is clear (to me, at least ;-) ) that this film was and still is a work of pure brilliance. A film in which every moment is a masterclass in technique, design, cinematography, editing, story-telling, music, and art direction. And this is a film that not only takes us into the mind of a young girl, but a young woman in love. A film that I will always cherish.|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
I was n't sure where this was headed until the ending . when it turned out that this was all a joke. i was never sure what the heck i was meant to find in this movie. it would be easy to think that i just would get a weird sense of humor for the movie. the ending however was unexpected. i was a bit confused when they turned around the projector. i was like what is this, a prank. but when i watched it, it was clear that the ending was not a prank. so i guess i was meant to find that.|0
A young man, named Danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named Bix, who agrees to tag along with Danny and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the town creep, Jesse (played by a perfectly casted Jack Elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie.|1
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. Isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?I also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around Southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion.|1
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago . and , i must say , this is the best place i have seen for the past few nights . it is very quiet and clean , the staff are helpful and knowledgeable , the food excellent . i will go back here when i visit the area , i highly recommend this spot to anyone who is interested in eating healthy and trying a new place ! We dined here with our son and daughter in law. Both of them had a wonderful evening. Our son in law had the lamb chops and our daughter in law had the duck breast.|0
This was a excellent movie. I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain. I also purchased the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my son's teachers watch it also.I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it. Thank You, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's.|1
"It's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even by that low standard this is a terrible film.Essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you're an ""Alan Smithee"" fan, avoid this one."|1
This must be the most boring film I ever saw. The only positive I can say about it is that thankfully I didn't pay to see it. We were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film. The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting.|1
"Like the beauty of the jungle , Jessica Alba 's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film , which follows her on a journey to find the meaning of life. The movie is directed by David Michôd , who has already made a splash with "" Birdman , "" but the actress is ready to get her feet wet in this genre of film. She will play a college student who is in deep trouble when she gets pregnant at the height of the recession. Her friends and family begin to question her decision ."|0
Simply put , there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out . They are: Part 1, 2,3, 4 and Part 5. I guess we have a lot to discuss today. So lets start off this post with an update of where we are at. A year back , I said , I would write a book and in a year I got the book finished . I would not say the book is finally published. It is in the middle of it. I would like to write more in this book .|0
"Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the ""film noir"" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) ""dupey"" looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it."|1
It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. To this end he has made an excellent, objective film. Spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech Amercians and auld-Europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.Nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means.|1
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad parts? I think that's what you're getting at there. So let me explain. You don't think there's a sexual undercurrent to the film, and I don't believe you are wrong. But let me rephrase. If you took the film out of context, what you would see is not the story as it is presented in its entirety, but a retelling of it based solely on what you can see from a particular point of view.|0
"For reasons I can not begin to fathom , Dr. Lorenzo Cameron ( George Zucco ) begins injecting wolf 's blood into the veins of animals he is experimenting on in his laboratory . As is the case with all great works of art , the first time I watch "" The Wolf Of Wall Street "" is not by watching the movie . The first time I see the film is in the film itself , where I sit and watch one of my favourite directors , Clint Eastwood , make an incredible film from an incredible story . That is not the point ."|0
"Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed ""The Guardian"". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible."|1
Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. I don't so I thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. Thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in Season 3, and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in Season 3. So, overall verdict? Just read the summary at the top.|1
"I 've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra 's music , and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life and his career . This essay will be about the songs of Frank, and how they influenced his life and career as a performer , and as an artist . As we will learn in the essay below , Frank 's singing and songwriting career was much more than being the "" Voice "". He also wrote some of the best songs of all time, including some of the greatest ballads ever. The essay is about how his songs influenced his career and life, and is written from the standpoint of Frank himself."|0
WARNING ! ! ! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS , AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE ! ! ! Okay , if you’ve watched the whole show , then you know this episode , is pretty darn good , as it should be , and it was definitely well thought out , this is what it takes to get me excited for season 5 . If you haven’t watched the show , you may not realize this , there was actually a season 3 episode , with a cliffhanger , that you haven’t seen , and you need to watch it now , but don’t worry , i will let you know .|0
"Underwoods goofy story about a young man ( Arquette ) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra and kill him for a bet, thus breaking his record. He actually manages to pull it off. They get him in an elevator, then the car crashes onto the road. Frank wakes up, his face all scratched and bloody, but he manages to come up with a great comeback: ""I think I'll be a big-time movie star!"" and he shows the scars to everyone, including Arquette."|0
This is a new Barbie movie . The graphics were really good . They made the movie seem partially realistic , partially cartoon . The animation in this one was good . I enjoyed some scenes in the movie . But the plot wasn't that appealing . The story was very predictable . I guess I'm just not a Barbie person . As much as some people enjoyed the movie, I found it lacking. And it made no sense whatsoever. I think it's because Barbie doesn't actually appear onscreen. Instead, the movie makes her up.|0
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film ? ! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER , and much more interesting. And it's MUCH cheaper to produce. In fact, it may be the best $20,000 you ever spend. So go out and buy this film and then see it again, again, and again. It will change you forever. If you are NOT going to see it, you may as well give up watching films at all. There are a couple of things I have noticed in the reviews here, and a few things I believe myself.|0
`` The next Karate Kid '' is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises . It has a good story , the action and humor are great . The first time I watched this movie I loved it so much that I went back and re-watched it about 15 years later . I fell in love with the movie because it was funny and had a great plot . It has a lot of fun with its humor , but also has a lot of action and danger . You can't just sit back , have a nice time and enjoy yourself . This movie is great and very enjoyable .|0
It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.|1
"I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of ""High Octane"" cop shows such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series."|1
Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising.Once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As would be obvious, they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings.|1
"I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway in 1980. It starred George Hearn and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production, which was videotaped for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original tape's age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly pressed DVD."|1
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s ( Casper Gutman , Signior Ferrari , Mr. Peters , Jerome H. Dowley , Charles B. Middleton ) , John Carradine , at his most prolific , was a star. And yet Carradine’s life ended far before the end of the Golden Age Hollywood . He spent more than 40 years on screen — and more than a year in an asylum — before dying of complications of diabetes on May 6, 1941 at age 54. He would have turned 81 that year. “The life story of John Carradine is his own,” notes the New York Times .|0
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, I must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact.|1
"ALERT : This review contains major SPOILERS . Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the trailer, the plot of the film can be summarized with the word ""furious."" However, the film is not exactly a thrilling adventure like the James Bond film, Casino Royale. The film is a thriller, but it is also a character-driven adventure movie. It does not take itself too seriously, nor does it have any pretensions to being an actual James Bond movie. Rather, it is just a well-crafted film, which tells a story that is fun to watch."|0
"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it."|1
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie . But Weber , who also directed , is a master in making boring films . So I was looking for a way to put him to the test . I had already seen the movie a few times and I had no clue why he made it so bland . I knew he had a good style but I didn’t know if he actually had anything to do with the movie . So I sat with him at a local bar and gave him 10 pages of dialogue to write a story to his script .|0
`` Carlito 's Angels '' is a spoof of `` Charlie 's Angels '' that is not afraid to spoof itself. The series is about the lives of female cops from various police agencies as they tackle the problems of being police officers. The characters are based on real-life cops, such as the one featured in the series, who has worked as an undercover drug cop in various cities. The first two seasons (1990–91) are set in San Francisco, California, while the last two (1992–93), and the third season (1993–94), in Los Angeles.|0
Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College , and judging from the enthusiastic response , he has much to be grateful for. He had a good show, but I had to be in the front of the theater to get up on stage and see his set-up. The rest of the band did an excellent job. I would recommend this event. WOW what an amazing show! I have been waiting for a chance to go see Eddie and his band in Boston for a long time, and this is why. Eddie Monroe is a legend in his own time and deserves every bit of the praise.|0
Do n't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover ( at least the Swedish version ), this book is actually an adventure game with quite a few layers.The story starts in the far east and a bunch of characters get kidnapped, and the player character is forced to go to a mysterious island to get the group to safety. There are also quite a few secret organizations that the player character gets to help. So, this book is great, but it is very hard to play, especially if you don't have the time to prepare your character.|0
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it 's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin . But even with the series ending it's not really over yet - because it'll be getting a whole lot more of a sequel in the near future. The latest in the series is set to arrive on October 28, 2032. It'll be the fourth film in the series, as well as the sequel to the 2013 movie. The film is being directed by Tobe Hooper , who helmed the previous Hellraiser movie. The plot will center around the re-emergence of the soul.|0
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense.|1
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone 's favorite master of suspense . As usual , the technical elements such as story and art are topnotch and the art is superb . One thing that makes this novel different from other books is the fact that we are getting to see a part of the plot through the eyes of a different character. The story and the characters are just so well crafted that I find myself loving these characters and rooting for them to prevail , even when the plot tries to thwart my expectations. The art is simply gorgeous and has a very nice cinematic feel to it.|0
Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house.|1
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its characters. What started out as an adventure story and ended as one, ended up being the story of a group of misfit friends, who had a different plan than what they had originally planned, to become a world-famous band. Will they achieve their ultimate goal, in a world where history was not so friendly to them? In an effort to make people understand that there is no one right way to go about making music, I made the movie as much about life lessons as it was an actual story.|0
"Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said ""Don't be stupid, be a smartie. Come and join the nazi party"". It brought us delightful films, such as 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane! ', and even 'Naked Gun'. But the good die young. Luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. And then... the Wayan's Brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'Scary Movie'. Suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes."|1
This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately!|1
My two daughters ( ages 11 and 13 ) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie a couple of months ago. We had watched it before but we decided to try the movie out for ourselves this time. So I thought I'd write a short review for you guys. I'll be honest here and tell you this is probably going to be a really short review. I have not seen any of the sequels to this movie and my daughters and myself are not really huge fans of this movie.|0
In Sweet Water, the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as Bone Eater and their bones are devoured by the monster. The half-breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressed by Krantz to arrest the protesters.|1
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary. It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds.I spent a few years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced Japan to get it. I was watching this with a well-travelled friend who's never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief.|1
There are no saving graces in this dreadful , stagey , boring snooze-fest , which brings to mind `` The Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' except one. And when the curtain is lifted on this wretched play it comes as no surprise to learn that it is one of the worst plays ever devised. There is only one word of praise, however, and it is uttered by Mrs. Siddons herself. This play, by the way, was written to open at the Haymarket Theatre on December 12, 1877, a date which was selected because of the proximity of Christmas day.|0
"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian, but I am learning right now.I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the US etc.But what I have to mention is:In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent. Americans talk ""Hochdeutsch"" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Besides, this is boring.I hope the original is better.The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond film."|1
"My son Adam (5 years old) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He like this film a lot. He particularly liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.Having seen the ""Vampire Rock"" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.Few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the TV cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. You either like this or love it."|1
This movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long, long while. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar.|1
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO. It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater, providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers.|1
The reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about moses, God was staying out of it. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also the people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it, It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again.|1
In general, I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend.|1
"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy ""Chainsaw massacre""-feeling, everything falls apart.SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these ""fooled-ya""-movies can figure this out.This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind."|1
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player.|1
Being a fan of the series I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What's with that dance scene??? The only reason I didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny.|1
This movie was physically painful to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger )I am an old , grumpy bastard . But I am also a sucker for bad acting , so , I give it a big thumbs down . The story of the movie ( I won't spoil for those who don't give a shit ) is this : a young woman is forced into prostitution by an older man. She is then raped , and is forced to give up the money she made in the act of service .|0
"I have never seen this in the theater, my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.Hitch's pallet here is the ""game play"" between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice?"|1
It looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. The film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. May god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new one and only reason why I never will want to see (or trust) an Australian made film again.|1
"If you want to truly experience the magic (?) of Don Dohler, then check out ""Alien Factor"" or maybe ""Fiend"", but not this. Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but ""Nightbeast"", which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor, is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor."|1
"Where do we start with an offering like this? I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms ""League of Extraordinary Twaddle""."|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film , I would have told you it was fine. But there were a few scenes where the movie wasn't exactly how it should be, so I guess you could say it was a little off. And to say the least, there were a few scenes that were a bit too graphic for my taste. The most graphic was probably the scene when the mother was killed with a knife. I found it so shocking that I almost turned the volume down on the TV until the movie had finished.|0
Mixed group of `` experts '' ( explorers , divers and scientists ) venture a mile underground and go another mile back up, with the result that a whole world becomes visible for the first time. What are they looking for down there and why have they been unable to make out the topography of their own backyard. Why have they been unable to spot the landmarks they have lived by, such as the railway line or the bus stop , the telephone exchange or the post office box ? Why have they been unable to identify the different kinds of birds and the different varieties of plants?|0
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries, odds are you will find this one fascinating. Not only does it have a well-mapped out plot that while easy to follow, contains its interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured.That being said, if you know nothing of Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single-handers boat race around the world...as was the case for me...please stop reading, and rent/view this film.|1
I must first mention that as a group of mates , we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are not for us, but which we would enjoy. Some of these we like , some we don’t, but we all enjoy the films, for the most part. In fact most of the films we like we can watch again and again without ever getting bored. One of the films we find very entertaining and we enjoy is ‘The Outlaw Josey Wales’ . This film has won many awards , including the National Movie Award , which is one of very few films to have won this particular award.|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours , I ca n't seem to forget this haunting film . it's so haunting , so beautiful that I can still feel the atmosphere when I rewind it , long after I have seen it twice again . I think the first time I saw this was in the early 1980s at the University of Utah , but I have not seen it since , and it's only been in my mind for the past few years . The story revolves around a young boy , and a woman who is his father's apprentice .|0
"Of course I am going to think it was a great movie . I recognized several people I did n't know were in it , and I recognized the film makers of course . It was very funny at times . I wish I could have gone to see it . Alfred Hitchcock: Master of Suspense . Hitchcock was the only filmmaker in the history of the world to receive a Best Director Oscar and also a Best Picture nomination (for "" North By Northwest "" ) . In the years between the award nominations and the release of "" Alfred Hitchcock . """|0
I 've never made one of these before , but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something. It's probably a good thing I did because I have nothing else to complain about in the film other than this. There are no good characters in the movie except for Bill Paxton and Jennifer Aniston. Both are so bad that you really can't believe the movie had them play these characters because they both have zero chemistry. The story is so ridiculous that you wonder how they could pull this off and you find yourself laughing out loud at some parts of the script.|0
"This is one great , sweeping , movie you will remember for a long time . It is about history , romance and love . The movie is full of love , romance , passion , humor , adventure . I liked it a lot . I hope everyone will like this movie as much as I did . This movie is in 3D . This is great . You will like this movie a lot . Thank you for making this movie . See you in 2013 . Enjoy the movie

I liked the film, I enjoyed it a lot. But the plot was a bit too complex to understand for me."|0
"Found this film for one dollar ( $ 1.00 ) and the film was a complete waste of time . i was so excited when i saw this film for just one dollar but as soon i saw it i knew this movie was going to be total garbage 
when i saw it you would think that it was a hollywood movie . the acting was great , the music was great , the plot was great but unfortunately this movie sucked the whole time . first of all this movie was so boring , second of all i was so excited when i found this for one dollar ."|0
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act!|1
"Well , the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out ... and they seem to get worse every time . First, they started with The Outer Limits in the early '70's. They did it again in the mid '90s, but this time they started with the Alien movies and the second half of Alien Resurrection, and the result is a movie called Alien Resurrection , which is very bad indeed. The movie has a plot where the ""Alien"" is resurrected from stasis, but it turns out the ""Alien"" doesn't actually want to be dead."|0
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford and the stories surrounding his rise to success. For those who aren't up on the band, it's easy enough to see who they play for. This is not your average ""rock n' roll band"" that you might have heard of in the past; this band is no ""rock n' rollers"". These guys are not the typical guys who you would think would have been able to play a song like this; this band actually knows how to play."|0
"I recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about dreadful! Any movie Ed Wood ever put out looks like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as ""These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me"" Classic! The mad 'Jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter."|1
Such pain ! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea , but it never fully arrived. I would rather go to a place in my mind where the pain has never been felt than to a place where there is nothing but pain. That’s it. Pain is nothing but that. It is not an entity , but rather the absence of something . It is the same with pain in your body. It is not what you feel there in the flesh, but that which has not been felt.|0
Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick 's Clockwork Orange there was of course `` no question about it '' that he was the master of cinema. In fact one of his best works is the movie `` Eyes Wide Shut '. It's about a beautiful woman who was betrayed by her lover and was killed by a man who had no idea she was there. Kubrick has chosen as the best actress of his era, Marilyn Monroe, for his new film and it's been a long time since she's starred in a major Hollywood movie.|0
"I 've never understood this type of spoof movies . You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and then you have this movie made by a bunch of guys that have to take some ridiculous/ridiculous plot points that aren't even remotely believable . Then, it ends up having a very bad/very bad ending because all of the stupid plot points make everything else totally un-believable . Like , ""I thought that it was all a hoax/fantasy , when it turns out that there actually is a real world/fantasy world that is happening in this movie/comedy movie ?"" . I don't understand the appeal to these types of movies."|0
Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction.|1
This movie was probably one of the worst movies I 've seen in a very long time . A friend told me that I need to get off my butt and watch it, so it 's on the DVD . I can't say that I'm surprised, but I 'm sure glad I saw it , I think that was an awful movie . This movie has not a single thing to do with it 's original story , I think it 's supposed to be a remake of some other movie that 's been beaten to death , I mean there's no original story at all , it just rehashes some movie .|0
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good !!! Thought it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying. This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out scenes of course, to keep any horror buff like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good IMO. Even though its not a high budget movie, the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes. Worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure!|1
Don ` t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME OF THE DEAD. The concept is original and the story and the acting is very good and if you liked the original you` ll love this one and I do hope that it comes out well. In this new version the plot is just a lot shorter and is not as involved and the ending of the film is not quite what the viewer expects in terms of the end. But this is still an enjoyable and enjoyable movie.|0
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor , but this is in a league of its own . If you are a fan of British film , you would be familiar with this one . And I would bet that this will also be the one you will refer to first when someone asks you what kind of films you like . This is one that is often overlooked by film critics , not because its quality is poor, but rather because of the amount of hype it gets . When you watch this film for the first time , it makes it seem like something special .|0
"""Disappointing"" is the best word I could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the US athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced.What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?"|1
What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this . Folks, what was I thinking in adding this film to my Netflix queue in the first place? I mean, it looks good and all, but it's only rated 2.0 stars. What if I can't get to the theater to see this movie?? What if it turns out I really hate it? I watched the film. I'm not saying that it's bad, per se. It looks good.|0
I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I couldn't say it better. The worst movie I've ever seen... and I've seen lots of crap! When I read you comment I thought only about the thoughts I had while watching the movie. When I saw who was one of the script writers I understood it. Balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. And his scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young Americans coming on vacations.|1
Well , this movie is really `` PLUMPED '' HAHA Get it ? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. Thats what made this movie so great. The acting , cinematography , editing & the music is great . But the story is so bad . The movie is really boring & has nothing new in that story . The movie goes on & on about the life of these 2 people without showing anything . It goes on like 3 hours but you don't get a single good story about them. There is only one main story .|0
I can't really criticize this film. It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. The acting is on a high level.|1
This is n't a bad TV movie . Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion , which means Penal Batallion . And Shtrafbatnoy is its Russian equivalent . There are lots of good things in it , though . It was a little slow at the beginning , but it soon settled down . The acting is decent . The cast is filled with actors , who have been making movies for years . The story of the movie goes like this . The movie starts with a military police unit in Moscow , which has been set up to catch thieves .|0
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly.|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other . Henry May Long is a young man who is having trouble with the police. He gets caught stealing and gets a jail sentence. His father then dies and he becomes an orphan. The story takes him on a long trip through different countries, with his dog and his girlfriend. You get a great feel of the life that Henry has lived. This movie with good story and fine performances. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a story that is very touching and sad.|0
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction.|1
Low budget mystery . A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. She does not get far though as she crushes to the ground and a large shadow approaches. A man stands up and takes out a gun and points it at her. He then says something to her and says, “what the hell”. She goes back down. Then he says again, as if to make sure. “What the hell?” The woman responds, as she crawls, “you said ‘what the hell'”.|0
If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see ‘Red Dawn’, the ‘Terminator Salvation’ or ‘Rambo: Last Blood’. There is one war movie which is sure to make you see things clearly, and that is, ‘Gangs of New York’ , a true masterpiece, a great adaptation of a great story , one of the best movies ever made , and not just the best gangster movie , but the best film in the whole history of movies.|0
As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored.|1
This is a very enjoyable , fluffy , glamorous musical from the 40 's . 'Cover Girl ' made Rita Hayworth a very wealthy woman , and her fame extended to all of Tinseltown . But this version of the story is different from the movie version. 'The Grapes of Wrath' tells the story of an American migrant family who come to California in order to seek work. The film has been well received and it is regarded as ' the best motion picture about migration ever ' . So it is not surprising that this new production is not a direct copy of the original .|0
Solo is a poor film - that can not be ignored . The acting for the most part is very good but the direction is not that of a master . The character development for most of the characters isn't that great . I thought the film had potential . But overall i thought it was good . Just not my cup of tea in the least . The director should have tried to take it to the next level instead of trying to make it work with what he has in his mind . The ending was not as good as i would have liked .|0
This movie was much better than I expected . ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate , even though some of the lines are just silly and predictable . To my surprise she did not appear to have a very good voice for the part . The film was actually quite interesting and I look forward to the sequels . But I was a little let down when the ending was spoiled , and I had not read the book so I knew nothing of the story . And I really do not like that the film was not set on a pirate island , which would have been far less confusing .|0
I 'm not sure if this is a comedy or not , but I found it pretty comical . Isobel , a young woman who works in a bar and loves her job, is in love with her customer . But she can' t tell him that because it is a secret . He loves the girl but her family doesn't approve . They want her to be with another man . She gets into a terrible fight with her family . Now she has no choice but to stay in her job or go to a brothel . The man who loves her takes her to a brothel .|0
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and trite sports theme.|1
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . The film is about the lives of two best friends on the dance team. We watch the lives of these kids as they grow up with dreams and challenges. And we also get to see the journey of a dancer in search of her own dream. As the story is told, we realize the film is a combination of both real and fictitious parts. We start out by watching the dance team practices at school. This is where the story starts off.|0
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!)|1
"This film flopped miserably in the UK, and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was ""Atonement: Part 2"". While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to Wales."|1
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of the stores when I decided I had better buy a new VHS player. I didn't really buy any other VHS equipment that day so I had to settle for the new VHS player – which I have since replaced with a Panasonic VX-A35 – but the visit to the video store was the inspiration behind the VHS player I'm building for myself. (You can read my full post on my decision-making process here).|0
"For a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment, but certainly not here. Even the ""miracle"" scenes were contrived & un-believable. And what's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story?"|1
"This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the Latin American countries, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a ""dog eat dog"" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a ""no frills"" approach, this movie will get to you, Great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection."|1
"While I hold its predecessor , `` Fast Times At Ridgemont High , '' as a standard to which other stories should aspire, I'd like to share with you the one book that I wish hadn't happened. But it was the right choice, I suppose, given how much of a mess it all was and how far it could have turned out. The film was based on James Thurber's 1952 comic strip ""Ridgemont High, Jr."" (which itself is based on Thurber's 1930 novel ""A Smart Aleck in College "")."|0
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...Grand Champion. The story of a 12 year old boy (Buddy) that with the help of his sister, Mom and best friend is determined to raise a Grand Champion steer. It is a whimsical journey to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hokey....it would be on a bun!|1

Yeah, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting as well. The whole worm-looking-thing was really creepy in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] Anyway, lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode,The Good: The parasite thing. Awesome!Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww... <33It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear.|1
When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an `` intelligent person '' is like , they fail so miserably , they ought to get the idea that a `` human '' is a being who does not want to be made a slave by an intelligent being , and so he has no choice in the matter. He must do the intelligent thing , no matter what the intelligent thing is, but he never gets to choose. He never can. And that is why intelligent people often are not happy with what they are, because intelligence does not make people happy.|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But, I liked it. I found myself grinning through the entire movie. I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I pictured them. And the town and scenery were just right as well. I recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.|1
"This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema . The film had a great plot, but the ending left many people unsatisfied .The film is based on the life of one of the characters from the film ""Budapest"" . It was a film that was produced for Poland in 1945 . It was very successful at that time . In 1954 , the film was released in the United States . During that time , it was released in America , it made a big box office in New York ."|0
As much as 'The Beginning ' showed that we 're still going to get `` classic '' x-files , Drive Me Insane will make it look like we're never getting rid of them . As with any franchise , Drive Me Insane is not a traditional horror movie, and the plot is far from conventional . What the film does have going for it are a couple of intriguing plot lines ( most notably the question of why a guy is in a deserted building full of women with nothing to do , and that's only the first part of the movie ) .|0
THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes.|1
OK , to start with , this movie was not at all like the book . I read the book , loved it , saw it at the movies many years ago , and I was quite impressed . I saw a few parts of this movie , but I had no idea what to think until I got home and saw this film , and I have to say , I was not impressed at all . I really thought the acting and writing was all very good , but the direction , acting , and editing seemed all amateurish to me .|0
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song.|1
"I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film , in the theater . I have a hard time remembering when I went to see it , and I don't really know what it was about , since I didn't really pay any attention when watching it . I just remember thinking "" this is weird , it is dark , the sound is creepy and it is in black and white ."" I was very impressed when I found out the movie was directed by Sam Peckinpah . I have seen some of his films before , and I know he is one of the most difficult directors to like ."|0
I simply cannot understand how any Who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here.|1
First, let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.I have spent my entire life living in the Peidmont region of NC. I have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. I have lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind.In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community.|1
"""The Journey"" is a romantic version of the cold war. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956. She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.Of course, the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip."|1
Brilliant Aussie movie ... A little slow at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n't stop the fun . the music is wonderful . it makes you feel like you're there . there's a good message here about being true to yourselves . the acting is all on the level . the message is true . it shows you that you can be the best you can be . that you can be successful , if you really believe in yourself . and that you don't need anybody . it shows you that you don't have to look up to someone to do great things .|0
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. Only living. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. To see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the movie, are desensitized.|1
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson . This film didn't quite measure up to expectations, which is to be expected. The story is told from a few different points of view. But what the audience was left with is the impression that this was not the movie we had all hoped to see on this day. The best thing I got out of the movie was a feeling of regret for the way things were and the way they were getting. The idea was a good one but the execution was a lot more mixed than I expected.|0
As a parent of two girls ( 14 and 11 ) I have grave doubts about this show and all the parents who like this show. The premise of it is so bizarre that it's hard to get into any of the episodes. There were some that I thought might be ok because they did some great things with their girls. One in particular where they have to put the girls in a time tunnel and take them through it and then go in time. What a great show they are. The worst part is how many parents actually like it.|0
I have seen several Yul Brynner films -- yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions. This movie is a beautiful tribute to an amazing man. Thank you, Yul. A wonderful and touching documentary about the life and tragic death of Yul Brynner in 1977. The film features interviews from all of the major parties involved in Brynner's life and tells the story in his words. The one thing that makes the film a success is the way Yul's father, Jack, tells the story. His story is told in such a way that every time you watch it a new perspective is gained.|0
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers , if garbage could ruin motion picture careers . what a joke , i could have done that to the first ten minutes , if i had not seen a trailer for this film that made the first ten minutes of my life . it's a story about a young girl , played by hilary quinn , who is kidnapped by a group of hooded teens . she is forced into prostitution , which she finds so revolting , that she runs away with her two best friends .|0
OK , I 've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way down his web-site. There is no doubt that he 's a talented individual. I 've also seen his work in the past, in fact I was very happy to hear that he was in The Last of Us. I don' t always have a great love of zombie films, but there's something about Zucco that just grabs my attention. On the rare occasion that his name does come up I do pay attention to them.|0
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting , and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship . The mother and daughter bonding aspect was just too much , and I'm sorry I didn't feel it more strongly on my first read through . The chemistry between Portman and Sarandon's characters , though , really drew me into the book , and I really felt for Sarandon throughout most of the book . That's one of the reasons I rated the book a 3 , but this time it was just the right kind of emotional ride for me , that's all .|0
I totally agree . This is `` Pitch Black underground '' and a well worn plot . The best scenes are in those moments when you think you're losing control. I also love when she's on her knees with blood all over her face and she doesn't even know it . She's so desperate . The ending was predictable enough and I'm sure it'll probably happen sooner than later . In the end I can't help but think that they're going to have to find out what is in that jar because they have to find her and they don't seem willing to do it .|0
This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters, bad acting by every single actor and a plot that just sucks the life out of all of your senses. But it does so in a manner that could very well make you think '' that's not very good '' or that '' it was a bad idea '' but you don't have to '' give it up '' for '' another movie. This is not a bad film, not by a long shot, it is just not a film I can see myself watching again in a few years.|0
Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? That's not funny, that's just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.|1
After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY ( which is still my favorite Dassin ) I was more drawn to the other movies I saw this year. In my opinion there is not much more I would say can be added or subtracted from the other movies. So here are some links to those movies which I am sure are going to be interesting. For me the most enjoyable movies are ones where you can feel the tension building and where it feels like something is on the horizon but you are still not sure when it all will come crashing down.|0
I find this film meretricious , tentative , lethargic , and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid . if you take my point of view , it is one of the bad choices because it is an anti-climax and all it does is to try to draw your attention to how badly this movie is made . when you really look at this film , you realize that it has been made by two men . the director of this film , ted bundlestad ( gary williams ) , has no talent to make a mediocre film , even at his lowest points .|0
The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman 's `` Autumn Sonata '' ( 1978 ) starring Ingrid Bergman . It is far from the same. It does have one of the most memorable sequences of `` Autumn Sonata '' , and the film makes an effort to remind us what the movie was all about. Bergman did a good job of casting Ingrid Bergman in such roles, as she did in other films. But she is so often cast as the femme fatale, rather than the heroine in her own films, like in the `` Winter Night '' ( 1970 ) or `` The Mirror '' ( 1974 ).|0
I thought the movie was sub-par . The acting was good but not great , the story was funny but not all that interesting , the dialog was not very good , the cinematography and special effects were great , but all in all, I felt it was a waste of time , and I’ve seen worse . There were a few good points in this movie, but it was just not good enough to take home the Oscar. It’s not a bad film, but it could have been better. The performances are mostly fine, but not good enough to warrant the film.|0
"This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before I was so bored with it I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. The premise of ""Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...."" has been done over and over to death."|1
Oh my God ... where to begin ? `` Chupacabra Terror '' is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made, and this time it is even worse ! The movie is so bad that nobody can make it worse ! The movie is such a horrible horror that there are few things that could have made the film even more horrendous. As I watched this movie, I realized that even the best horror movies have horrible endings. There are some movies that I think are so great because of their very nature, that there isn’t enough to give them a bad ending.|0
Thank God I have fast-forward . I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls . A man who struggles with his life and career, and falls in love and dies in a car accident and has his ashes thrown in the sea . Now that's my dream movie . You're right, but I'm not really looking for a remake. So the question is if there is any chance of it becoming a remake, because that is a film which would be worth remaking because of the story, I would think. That's the problem I have with these movies.|0
I 've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days , and must urge you to seek it out. It's the film from my earliest memory and one I can still hear in my head like the sound of an old train going through it's final miles . I remember how I laughed so hard I nearly had to sit down when I saw the film in the cinema. In it's day , the film is one of the very best comedy's of its kind . It is an all out riot .|0
"I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and ""perfect"". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film."|1
Simply put , Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable . The movie is less about the raw science of how it all went down, and more about the emotional and psychological impact of what it all means and of what was lost in the process. There are no winners in this movie . The scientists lose, the people who worked in that lab have lost what they were able to accomplish , and the public loses its faith in all of the hard work that the military and scientists have put into finding this killer .|0
"Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. This film does not. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, ""I don't remember sending for room service"". The main entertainment value is in its badness; I recommended my local video story put it on the ""Turkeys"" shelf."|1
"Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it! )I do wonder, however, how a certain... um, finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though--especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question!"|1
Admittedly , the only reason I watched this film -- since it 's been about a decade since it was released and I still haven't gotten to the end of it -- but I had to watch it. Not because it was entertaining, mind you. I 'm sure the film is far more interesting than what was shown here . I just have to admit, it was refreshing to have a story told with a much greater sense of reality. I'd never heard of 'em until I saw an interview with 'em and then realized they were friends of mine.|0
Although i do n't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago , I still like watching it . There are some parts that are funny , but they are all predictable and pointless , especially the part at the very end where he says that if he makes a mistake in his life , he will regret it so much because of which he won't live his life with full of hope and joy but will live with fear , so if there is a life to be lived , why should he worry ? .|0
You do n't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I do n't know a word for this, but that doesn't mean you don't know it, and you don't. This film is truly a jewel in the cinematic crown. The best thing you can say is that it deserves its own movie category. There are two reasons for the film's high rating. First, it features one of the best musical sequences ever in a movie and second is it is probably the best film directed by an Asian person. Let's start from the beginning.|0
"Two years after this movie was made, ""The Juror"" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See ""The Juror"" instead. ""The Juror"" is essentially the same story as ""Trial By Jury,"" with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her."|1
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist, helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best, but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieves some poignancy, but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury, a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting.|1
Sam O'Steen , the film editor on the superlative suspense flick `` Rosemary 's Baby '' from 1968 , here on the eve of the anniversary of the infamous murder of Rosemary andits two surviving babies. This is the extraordinary story of Rosemary and how she managed to stay alive for two weeks and give birth to what is considered one of cinema's most memorable deaths, even while her husband was dying of complications from a botched blood transfusion. In fact, the baby she gave birth to is the baby she is alleged to have given birth to; she gave birth to two babies and both died.|0
This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget film) is much better . I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film. THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing.|1
Loosely based on actual events , `` River 's Edge '' is a film , much in the style of `` Titanic '' and `` The Sound of Music , '' that takes viewers on a journey of heartbreak, hope, and redemption. It is about a couple , a boy who loves them , and an old hotel that may be their salvation. On the surface it looks like a romantic story about love and heartache , but the story is really about the hotel and the people in it. You don't know how the story ends , but you will be drawn into the lives of these characters .|0
I thought this was a great action flick. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. It got me thinking, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking butt. I just hope to see Geena in another film soon. Seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long.|1
I mean , come on ! This movie had such nice potential but it 's like they ran out of ideas and they couldn't do anything to make this movie better ! They should have added more songs in this movie ! I really liked this movie because this time we don't had a heroine in the movie ! I think we should see more action movies in this time because we don't have action in this movie ! I would suggest to make more action movies for the time we have now ! I loved this movie from start to finish !|0
Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in New York. These are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. They exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is appears somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from ? How did they get there ? How do they cope ? Where will they end up ?|1
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound but would have liked to have more. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapons. Great costumes!|1
Predictable , cliche , unbelievable , boring ... what else can I say ? It 's only the caliber of the writing , and the direction , that keeps the book afloat . I had to read this to understand it all , and it is only here , on a few select pages , that I can really say that I enjoyed it . Still , I will have to wait a while before going back and reading the previous volumes in the series . I 'm sure that it will all be worth the wait , just as you know that reading The Lord of the Rings is nothing short of worth the wait .|0
I have always liked the Carry On films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. Basically, many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g.|1
"I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out . They showed clips every so often, and then they showed one or two seconds, then a whole lot of the video. I did the same thing . I just watched it and thought ""what is this, how can they do this"" , so I watched the whole thing. The only thing I think I like more than the actual story of the film is watching it and knowing it is in the same category as other films like that one."|0
"Sorry about the ""extremely clever"" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help myself.I've been meaning to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten."|1
Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it's must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, Jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme out was a very good choice.|1
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.It's a poor mans' CSI. Or actually, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought.|1
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. What is just as bad is their inability to FEEL anything about it.Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget.|1
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and create an account so that I could view it and then write a review of it. In short, it was awful. But it's a good thing, I tell you. The story begins with a group of women who have been trapped in a burning building for hours when they are rescued, and one by one they are abducted. It's an interesting setup, but it quickly takes you into the depths of depravity, even as it presents a solution.|0
`` Tart '' is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying : `` If you do n't know where you are going, you don't know where to turn''. (1) _Hindu-ism in India_ , Vol. II. (2) _Ibid_., Vol. VI. ## 6. ### SRI VIVIYARAGI YOGA SUTRAS. Sri Viviyaragu was the great master of Yogi Bhajan. In his _Yogapradhatu_ , a great work by his great grandfather Sri Vidyanagar, this great master explains the essence of Yogi Bhajan.|0
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.We saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive.|1
I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.The major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do.|1
The film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere -- or, at the least, anyone can go to the cinema and see the movie. The story is about two men who fall in love and have to live in a society where they cannot marry the girl they love. What is so fascinating about “Love, Life and War” is the way it manages to combine the very different, yet also very universal themes of human life and human existence. At the same time, it addresses the universal issues of war and peace.|0
If you 're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara , the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro overthrow the U.S. occupation of Cuba in the 1960's, then you should see the new film 'Che' . The movie is set during the time of the Cuban Revolution and is based on a true story. It follows a group of Cubans who travel to Brazil to learn how they can help in Cuba's struggle against the United States occupation. These men are not revolutionaries like Guevara and Castro were at the time they are in Cuba, but they are the only people in Brazil who know him.|0
There's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time.|1
Based on a fairly bland `` best seller , '' this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played to a large number of empty seats; it wasn't exactly the biggest box-office success of its kind. And though the movie does have its fans, I think it's a case that can be made that the best thing to do when watching this sort of movie is to skip it. Not everyone loves it , and it did not get nearly the critical and commercial acclaim as The Graduate , with which it shares a number of scenes and which, as you know, is widely considered a classic film.|0
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by MST3K.George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated, overly-theatrical performances I've ever seen.|1
"Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons , I had hoped that the sequel would be much better. So, I thought I'd try my own way and write up some thoughts. I have read the comics, but I haven't read any of the movies. The first movie was really good and I really enjoyed it. I thought the second movie was a nice step up for the series and I was hoping the sequel would be much better. So here goes. THE DEPARTURE

Let me start off by saying I was very disappointed by the movie's end."|0
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner . Technically , it 's horrible . The acting is the weakest in the film , with a total lack of chemistry between two men who play brothers . What makes the movie interesting is the idea behind the film , and the fact that we now have to look at how we deal with the idea of evil within the family . We know that Sam is evil , but how much of that evil is within himself , and how much is within his family ? It is an interesting question to which we have not really had any good answers .|0
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous.|1
"`` A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being . His experiment leads to an accident that destroys the human being's DNA and leaves the scientist with only his own DNA . The movie was released in the year 2000, and the movie was a critical and popular success. It has an Rotten Tomatoes score of 96% , and an IMDb rating of 8.7/10. * * * * *

The plot of the story is very predictable and basic. The movie follows one scientist, Dr. Robert Duncan, who attempts to create a human who will be perfect."|0
I went to see this because I 'd never seen Tel-Aviv , where the story is set . I was not going to do it at first , and I thought that it is a bit of a joke , but I really liked it and it made me think .I think it was a little too short , but not much , and it had some great ideas . The main characters were well drawn and well thought out . I didn't care for a few parts of the plot and story , but I could not put the book down . I am looking for more books set in Jerusalem .|0
"I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. No one else was at all memorable. I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child. I even think I had a plastic ""Seaview"" that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub. Long time ago.As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards."|1
"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. ""You Are Alone"" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!!"|1
"""Chupacabra Terror"" is saved from a '1"" by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of THE RELIC. John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. He does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome."|1
This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig having been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. However, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided.|1
"Jennifer Montgomery's ""Art for Teachers of Children"" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here?"|1
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors , eating non-ants , and conquering the world with flying machines , it is time to go to a film festival. Ants Attack! is coming to South Africa from April 1 – 3, 2010. We will be attending Ants Attack! on the same day that we have a very special event on Saturday April 2nd. On April 2nd, we’ll be hosting a day full of fun activities for all ages at the festival. You can find all the information about Ants Attack! at the official event site.|0
Well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. If that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.If, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with HUGE cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so hard I nearly cried.|1
Deep Water ( 2006 ) * * * * '' It is indifferent ... it 's there waiting for you to pull up the tent pole. It doesn't care if there are three or a million people camped out on top of the highest hill on Mars or whether we can communicate with them or whether they are the same as we are.

This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a film flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..This is a long film, but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love.|1
You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey.|1
"...out of this movie.Sorry to say, this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the Festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. ""Not so..."" I was told. ""the director wants it this way"". Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialog is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words."|1
"Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like ""Arrested Development"" and yet they keep this show and ""War at Home"". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy ""Married with Children"", but now it's just getting ridiculous. ""The Loop"" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpons"" work because there is a constant flow of jokes."|1
This show is terrible . I can not get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains . . . . . . It’s just not good. I mean, really . . . . really, really bad. And by that I mean “really” in every way . . . and also “bad.” The worst episode of the season. And the season as a whole. (Well, actually it’s the worst episode of the season. I’ll get to that.)|0
i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell.|1

"Do not see ""Mr. Magoo."" It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny in it. He has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the entire movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have stayed that way."|1
Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'The Street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the American productions.There was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'.|1
"What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not that much. With the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. None of which were funny. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the ""zany"" one-liners."|1
... but had to see just how bad it could get. The plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. A female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. The surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'Lesbian Conspiracy'. The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby.|1
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director , but he has made some of the worst films of the past 20 years, which is saying something. In the last two decades the director has released two films to critical and popular acclaim, neither of them among his better works. So it comes as some relief that, like a good many critics, the man himself feels that this time he has done something right, if not great. So why not enjoy his new film In the Land of Men, and not the rest?|0
Death Camp Opera : Right Here , Right Now ! Ten years ago , I read that a very special person was going to die . This person is my brother . The story I told you is true . When I was a child , I loved the opera. The opera was the most beautiful thing I ever saw .

"What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one.The story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. Like the surf ""dudes"" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about that you NEVER saw them surf once!!"|1
"OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . Be careful about who you see on a public transport system. If you have seen or met the following, it is highly unlikely that they are the good guys:
1. The person who asks if you want to share a blanket with your kids, or if they will take them out for their birthday. (That's the kind of question that should get a ""No."" It's asking for a free pass into a stranger's bedroom, because they are willing to make an exception.)"|0
With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.|1
Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film 's release for awhile . After finally seeing this film about a month ago , I am happy to say that it exceeded my expectations. So how did this film hold my attention so long after seeing it? Well, I believe it was because of two major things. One, the main theme of 's movie is the battle of the sexes. In my eyes , this is not just a simple war movie , but a real battle of the sexes .|0
This is one of L & H 's shorts most frequently cited as the first `` real '' L & H project and it was one of the very first to make a profit in its first year and to sell more copies than any previous film. In fact, it was made to demonstrate that there is no real problem with getting films made and to sell the films. It is an amazing story of life, the movie business and a tale of two directors. It also tells the story of the struggle to become the first independent studio of the post-war American film industry.|0
"This is my first ""awful"" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator. ""Hell Ride"", directed, written by and starring Larry ""Friend of QT"" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged."|1
Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' And the saddest thing of all is that I actually agree with these people's sentiments. Yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them finishes off The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. That's about as scary as it will get, people.|1
this film sucks a big one . so many holes in the plot . if the devil is invincible , he would destroy hell , not heaven . i was waiting for the end . i was really disappointed . if hell was destroyed , why there is such a thing in heaven ? i am glad that in the end he is defeated . but still , how do the people on the earth get a hell with devils in it ? why didn’t they just destroy hell in the beginning when they have the means to ? i thought , hell was destroyed by the people .|0

I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. He's a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-jail TV interview.The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually MADE her serve it) .|1
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini.|1
"No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or ""Big Paulie"" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, ""This Thing Of Ours"". Thankfully, the ""Eddie Monroe"" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized Paul's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. Out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future."|1
"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison."|1
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film . Its hit man theme is very dry and is one of the weakest parts of the film . The acting is below average , especially for a big name like Paul Blart , and the plot itself is uninteresting . In other words , its a movie with no plot at all . I also really disliked the music . It is generic and really nothing more than a filler for a movie , especially when there are plenty of better films that would have fit this theme . Overall , I thought this movie was a waste of time .|0
"How sad it is when a film as wonderful as ""Jurassic Park"" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name."|1
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early 'X-Files' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first ""rockin'"" episodes. It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature ""The Thing"", and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers."|1
I saw this movie on TV and loved it ! I am a real disaster film fan , and this is the one I would go to the theater to see. A movie that I would want you to be sitting next to me on my couch to watch. Also I think I would go out and buy the movie for my wife , and we would play it in the den , and when I got home she would say, “you want another drink, I want another drink” , she would never take anything but the movie. I watched it twice.|0
This is pure CRAP , and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever ... Absolutely inaccurate , I mean , what kind of movie is this ? Why the hell they didn't make the film in black & white ? It looks awful , and they made this movie on a budget . This movie is a disgrace and no one should go and see this . It is so bad that they should have done a movie about Christ , not this . No one would go to the theater and see it because they would think that the movie will be offensive to their religion .|0
"`` Opposing Force [ 1986 ] '' was n't as good as `` Dr. Strangelove '' and it was n't so clever. Still it had the advantage of knowing it was n't funny. '' In a way it was more interesting.

'' They were so close to the bomb that it looked like there'd be no way out. There was nobody to blame, just the people who'd done it. But you could tell it was bad for them, the way it looked. It was bad for the country. But they were determined not to get away with it."|0
In the mid 1800s , Irishman Dennis Hopper ( as Daniel Morgan ) emigrates to Australia , seeking a share of the great gold rush then in progress. He takes with him his wife Catherine , who had fled from Ireland with her mother and sister in search of a fresh start. Dennis and Catherine travel the country, trying to convince the people of the gold rushes potential, only to find that many are only too eager to sell. At the same time in the United States , a man named Harry Houdini is on the road, travelling the nation lecturing on a variety of magical acts.|0
YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941 ) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid 50s in the USA and still thrives today. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by William Faulkner, and written by Charles K. Feldman . The author, William Faulkner, is credited to have made Faulkner's novel the best selling non-fiction novel in history, with sales in excess of 2 million copies. Faulkner's book is now regarded as a standard of literature for college students across the country.|0
"i do n't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from beginning to end i would be happy if someone wrote a review about it saying how it is really boring and no one gives a shit. i have no idea if that is what the movie is like. but it is just a thought. it doesn't need to be like that. it has to be bad, bad, bad. but not so bad that people go ""wow! that is so bad that i would not even bother to even watch it."""|0
This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in expecting Blade Runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate.|1
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen . If so , than the third part , Underworld 3 would also be a very good movie .The first Underworld movie was very good .Now , the third one would be the one that could surpass the first one .So, this movie is all set to happen .I would like to mention this movie .Because the third part of Underworld movie is very close to the first one .The third one would be better than the second one .This is also the fourth one that we are all waiting .The first one was good , so I don't expect anything better from it .|0
This movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning Minnie Driver's character. I think that all too often Hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too.|1
This film , for what it was set out to be , succeeded . It 's a short tragic film , which in itself is enough for anyone to make the effort to watch . in the hands of an excellent director and an able crew , this film would certainly be better . i saw the film only the other day and there is no doubt that it is one of the most powerful and powerful short films ever made . however it is also a short film made for the most part by three men with very little background .|0
This movie had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However, it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.|1
I remember when this show came out . It was originally advertised as a mini-series . At the end of the mini-series, I had no interest in continuing the story . However, I decided to re-watch it in order to finish it . Needless to say, I did not regret it . I remember the night I decided to re-watch the series. I was in my room when the TV had just finished . I had no interest in continuing the show and the TV was switched on when I turned it off . I went out for a cigarette .|0
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too, it is also because this movie is set on a prison ship. So we can say that this film can be compared to Prisoners’ Row, in which a group of people were locked in a prison with a bunch of others for the same crime that was committed by the one in that film. It also has similar characters and situations in which they are in the same situation and the story follows them in the same order.|0
What a crap that movie is. The script is simply non existent. The movie at times seems like a music video. But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this flick just killed me. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the guy?|1
The greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director.|1

I 've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise . A Christmas Classic , it 's a story that was written for kids and it does a really great job . The movie is a story about a little boy named Sam . When he was young , his family moved to an isolated place on the edge of a forest . There Sam and his family live in a cabin and Sam goes out at night and tries to make friends with the wildlife . It seems like he can 't get the right one and Sam doesn 't know why .|0
In America , the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer ( Elijah Wood ) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection before the Holocaust. The novel is based on Foer's memories of the events surrounding his grandparents’ arrival to America, which took place when his mother was just a child. In the book, Foer describes how he was taught to write and read before he began his formal education, but was unable to read Hebrew. As a young boy, Foer remembers his grandmother asking him to write down the story of her arrival on the ship, as she didn't have the book.|0
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. They know what it means to have to stand in line for more than an hour. What happens when these students are accepted? They have to pay out of pocket to attend an institution that only has certain programs and only offers certain classes to certain people. I think this girl had to spend her entire childhood and young adulthood paying for school. The cost of her education at this school was a life sentence, or at least that was the plan.|0
The film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. Those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films).|1
Are sea side resorts the sad , dreary places they 're always depicted as in movies and novels ? Certainly not. They're not a sad place at all, and they have a lot of fun.

You can do all you want and have fun doing it. Well it depends.|0
"There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. This is the typical, ""I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army."""|1
A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie . 75+ % entertainment . Casey , Buddy , Kelly Marsh are both great actors . I know they have done many films together . But they are all unique . I really enjoyed this one . I recommend it to anyone . The only complaint I have is that the movie is pretty long but I have to say it was worth the time. This is one of the best family movies ever filmed. The acting is top notch, the plot is great. I can't think of a movie better suited for small children and teens.|0
What can I say about a movie as bad as this ? The people who made this movie , did not know what they wanted to make. They made the best movie of their lives for a bad script. I think it’s better to wait and see what it all comes down to . This is what I can tell you for the most part . Some of it is good . Some is good . It’s good enough to watch. The people who make “Babel” seem to know nothing about the world of cinema or its past .|0
This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the tough as nails character made this film so good . I'm sure anyone who is looking for a tough character should definitely check it out . Not only was it well shot, and well acted, but it was full of great fight scenes , and the final battle between Geena and her brother was one to be remembered . I really liked this movie! It was just what I needed. It wasn't an action movie, nor did I expect it to be one, but I liked the film very much.|0
.... is where I 'm assuming this movie came from . I mean , I 've watched plenty of B movies from the late 50s-60s , but I havn't seen one . So , I was curious . I went to youtube . This movie is listed on their movie page at the time . This movie has been in the list since Feb/Mar , 2011 . I found this in there as well . There's a picture of the title and a picture of the poster . It doesn't appear to be a recent poster , but I 'm not 100% positive on that .|0
"Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.Directed in part in a style similar to the ""Sympathy"" trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust."|1
This is a romantic , albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites . It is one of the many films where I wish there was more depth in the characters . You know , I wish there was more . I wish there was more of the relationship between Kishan & Neel. I wish they spent some more time with eachother and some more scenes of them together . I wish there was more love , passion & fun ! I wish it wasn't just about the love story and that we could see a bit more of Neel's perspective .|0
"""The Planet"" is an astounding piece of film making. For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original sci-fi films for a long time.Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well planned action. From the opening space battle, to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above it's budget.To start with the special effects, while certainly not ""Revenge Of The Sith"" standard, they are on level, if not above, the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape."|1
This is a haunting short film . Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt , ring true and haunt . You are left with the question , what does James Franco stand to lose? . You know this is a good one . You are not disappointed . You are surprised and stunned . You are left asking , who will win this time ? I have to say , this one is one you will not forget . This one is one you will not forgive . This is one you are not going to forget .|0
"I usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain.I don't usually watch sequels but I just had to see this since I love ""Rosemary's Baby"" so much. What a mistake that was. It simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. In fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be."|1
"Something not-so-great . `` Silence of the Lambs '' remains Demme 's only good film , and I 'm of the opinion that it should have won an Oscar for best screenplay, a nod it didn't get because the movie wasn 't nominated for the best screenplay. As you might have guessed from my ""Best of 2010"" feature, there were a number of other films that didn't quite make the cut. But, here's a list of the 10 films that I enjoyed the most during 2010, and what I loved about them:

"I've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read "" better than save private ryan""....mmmmm ...i thought cool! guys....is just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun. Nothing to do with a proper war movie. I want my money back! Why the f...k the peoples lies??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light....but they didn't make it. Sorry about this.....but the movie is awful."|1
"At the beginning of the movie, Ramgopal Verma says that ""Sarkar"" is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic. Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. Amitabh Bachchan plays ""Sarkar"", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home."|1
"(Contains really bad Spoilers) So what can I say about this....It's a really HORRIBLE and AWFUL movie! !.Too much CGI and special effects....you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is! !.PLEASE at least go watch ""Dungeons and Dragons"" which is another terrible pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons way better!!! Uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap!!!!!!!!!!! !I Hate this Trash!!"|1
I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. The second is from someone who has. (Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice.|1
Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios . Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio , obviously upset with the way he is being treated.Chaplin tells him he’s lucky to have been given the role. He also adds “What you’re doing at Lodestone is wrong”.He then tells Turpin he’s not interested in playing his character.Turpin says he’s going to play his character anyway, and he’ll just do it in a different way. Chaplin tells him to get out.Ben then tells Chaplin it would be “absolutely ridiculous” for him to play his character.|0
"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg."|1
This movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans that I have ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive!|1
I realise it 's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie ( which was grandiose ) so I've decided to release my version of the first commandment on my own terms. I know I've been saying this for years but I've finally managed to make something work and be honest. The first commandment is 'be honest' - I think I've been fairly honest here, I've said what I'd like and what I've achieved so far. But I want to be a little less open with the world, less transparent.|0
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic.|1
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys.|1
"There are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind ""The Ransom Of Red Chief""! Even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler."|1
"this film was probably the best ""scary film"" i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer, you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry."|1
"The basic idea behind ""Dungeon of Harrow"" isn't all bad. The acting, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really isn't much there to recommend this film. You know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say ""Special Guest Star"" and list someone you've never heard of. Might as well say ""Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln."" because there's really no one in this movie you can identify."|1
"This is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, did in fact have more laughs. This, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet ""Yahoo Serious"" so I could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. There is also very few things to say about Australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit."|1
"A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this ""masterpiece"" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. ""The number one comedy in America"" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over."|1
"The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was... not very good at all.Like others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.I thought the ending was rather unbelievable.By the way guys, about the ""blow torch in space"".Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name ""Oxy-Acetylene torch""). Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.So a ""blow torch"" would work just fine in space."|1
"Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and ""gritty downtown"" from a suburban perspective.The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola$, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men At Work, The Flirts and Bananarama.This movie truly is Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's Los Angeles."|1
A MUST SEE documentary.-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client.|1
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).A haunting, intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From).The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.|1
Okay , I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out our attic , I remember thinking what on Earth would you have done if you lived in my house. Well you have to wait until my husband gets home , I'm sure I will find out. But the movie is so very interesting , well acted and so full of comedy , that it is worth the wait. If you've ever wanted to know how it feels to live in a world without magic, without wizards or elves, then you've been missing out!|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that , I believe , is not equaled today . The colorful , colorful , colorful , colorful . . . The event was filmed in front of a live audience . I have not been a part of filming live events in years . I remember the moment I walked off the set after we had shot a wrestling match and the camera was rolling . My mind was just blown by what I was seeing . The audience had no clue as to the reality of the event we had shot .|0
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.What then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups.|1
To paraphrase Thora Birch : `` I kind of like this movie . It 's the exact opposite of everything we've been doing since the 70s. ''' That's an apt description, but only if you're as old as the characters in the film. I've never heard of this movie or any of the people involved. The movie is about a young woman who gets into an argument with a guy and when it escalates, throws him over the railing and dies. As you watch it, the audience is reminded that this is happening in one of the most dangerous countries on the earth.|0
"This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors (""Death On The Nile"", ""Evil Under The Sun"") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat."|1
Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS . Was heavily influenced by it ,and it is an excellent example of a film that should not be forgotten as it still has relevance today . A must see for any movie aficionado, it is not a film one would ever forget, even after the movie was over. The story revolves around a man who falls in with an odd couple who take him to an isolated beach resort. The couple, however, are not exactly what they appear to be, but they take in a lot of stray dogs and cats.|0
"I have for years remembered a song `` JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE '' ( `` No . twenty - one - nine - nine. """" "" I am not a couple. "") That was sung by one of my friends during our long summer vacation. The song came into our heads during our vacation, and as it is not one that we are likely to hear every day during our life in our home in the country, it had for me its own magic. There is another song that is associated with our family. It comes from my great-uncle, my father's brother."|0
"I realize most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience. But then why bother to call it ""Solomon Kane"" in the first place when the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. That's where the resemblance ends.It's always a bad sign when any superhero/fantasy/sci-fi movie lingers over an origin story, but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all, you've already missed the point completely."|1
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost ca n't help but be a rather depressing read. I know it is a common theme and I can see where people would get a bad taste, but I really felt myself cringing and feeling very sorry for the people they wrote about. I know I shouldn't judge them but it just made me feel so depressed to read. I know that they are all in recovery and know the dangers of drugs but I do think the writing was rather heavy-handed and just made me feel so down.|0
Not really worth a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there... Bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. At firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... However all this changes... and you still won't care.|1
"Spoiler with plot explanation : a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy, a good guy and a mysterious organization with no good reasons. the evil guy wanted to take control over everyone on earth, the good guy didn't want the world to end and the mysterious organization wants their own world to rule. Disclaimer

This is a fan-written story based on the works of various authors that are not necessarily my favourites. Therefore, some events might be different than what happened. Any resemblance of the works to my work is purely coincidental."|0
So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc.|1
Talk about creepy . If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was killed in the same accident was discovered and then shot, then I’ll recommend it. But you know what, you know what, if you want to sit down and watch this episode, then I want to sit down and watch this episode and have you sit down so you could see the girl and then you can watch her getting shot in the head. So let me tell you why this show is going to get you all fucked up. Why?|0
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd , and even more absurd if you know a lot of people who know cops . But if you’re in the city, you see them, too . The cops can’t come to your house. They want to know everything they can about your life, and if you have a gun. Or a gun problem, like in the two-year old case of a man who had his guns taken from him in an armed hold-up.|0
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it's very entertaining. You can always count on Will Smith as an actor who always delivers. He's very talented, handsome and a great person to be around. And he always has a good sense of humor, like the rest of his family. I'll definitely go see him in the next movie I see. It's an action movie with no real story and it's very boring, but I really enjoy Will Smith movies.|0
"There are a whole lot of movies , primarily from the 80s , that are so terrible that you ca't even get them to stop talking about how awesome they are. I'm trying to name one right now , but it'll take a little while. I've been thinking about it for weeks. You know, you're in a dark room and the movie starts, and before you have a chance to blink , the whole room turns to dust and your ass drops down to the floor. ""So what?"" You shout to the universe. But you're wrong."|0
When naïve young Eddie Hatch , a window dresser at Savory 's Department Store , falls for a statue of a young Marilyn Monroe , his life is turned inside out. As he learns to be Monroe 's friend, he begins to love her even more . As his love grows, his life becomes full of passion, sex , and even love. But, at the end of her life, Monroe makes it clear that she never loved him. Eddie tries to learn to accept that Monroe is not a woman he ever wanted to be with - even if, in his heart, he knows Monroe is his soulmate.|0
"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest , most off-putting , but most wonderful Broadway musical . It's an adventure in music and in comedy, and it's a tale that will haunt you if you are not already haunted by it . The story centers on a ""haunted house"" , a ""haunted street"" , a ""haunted tavern"" , and the tale of the man who haunts them . It is a story that has been told over the ages . . . and told so many times that it has lost some of its novelty and mystery . ."|0
While this is horribly dated , I MUST insist ... PLEASE , NO REMAKE ! Frankly , it just woouldnae work out ... I'd hate to have to remake every single scene of the original movie ... just in case you don't remember the original, you'll have to live with an inferior copy . I've seen the original version many times , and there's no question about how well it's been aged , and you don't have to wait for my opinion to come out in print . You can just go and rent it for yourself .|0
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I ca n't believe the amount of bullshit that this show has already been through. First off, a quick note on the first season: I actually finished the second season of Bones even before the first episode aired in the UK, because I knew I was only going to make it to week three if I kept watching every single episode. And even then, I thought it was just awful. I couldn't stop laughing, I couldn't bear to listen to the dialogue any more.|0
"Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the ""Dekalog"" but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure.The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5)."|1
I don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. I'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. Really, actually, I should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. Production is... well, okay. Barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clichés, and an abrupt ending.|1
I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie . I wish I had been there when it was shown. The movie was shown in the cinema and the screen was about 10 feet wide, so you could see everything. The story of this movie was very moving. The only problem with it was that the movie lasted over two hours. When it was over, I got up to go to the restroom. On my way there, it suddenly occurred to me that the movie was not over, so I walked right back into the screening room.|0
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD . Lost is the exciting and fresh concept of a new superhero team made up of ordinary men & women that fight evil and fight for justice, all while having fun doing it. In a nutshell, if you thought the X-Men series ended in the ’90s and were disappointed with the “mutants vs. normal people” theme then you would have been right. However, I was not really expecting that CITY OF MEN would be the end of CITY OF GOD.|0
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others. I was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. I still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half.|1
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. Just a great movie for ever, to time limit, just for the entire live, you must have in your collection! This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person.

A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure ( for a modern listener) metal bands. It’s a great way to find out about some bands you’ve heard of and may have missed out on. This isn’t a complete list, of course, as we are still finding out about all sorts of bands we might have missed out on in our youth, but it’s enough for now to get the wheels in motion for our first feature article.|0
Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious.|1
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically . Anyone who calls this film “the first modern horror flick” clearly doesn’t know their shit. If you do, read on. This review will be spoiler free because it is my personal opinion and I’d like for it to be clear that this film is NOT the original, it is a remade version, not a remake of the original but a re-make. This review may not contain a lot of information, so if you have to know everything, let’s go on.|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies , mainly because of the poor special effects. I was hoping that this would have a few more cool effects than the other movies in the series but there was a lot more to do here that it needed. The characters were all a lot more fun to watch . It was also interesting to see how many different countries were represented here in Mexico . The movie had some funny lines and was pretty good but it would have been better if it had some of the cool special effects that other movies in the series did.|0
"Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken, of ""TheWitches of Eastwick"" and the Addams family movies."|1
Larry Bishop, the Writer/Actor/Director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The film is a bomb.The Victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists.|1
Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isn't too much to complain about.|1
"I totally agree. This is ""Pitch Black underground"" and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. The scenery was great. Had they dispensed with the staple ""alien"" toothy CGI badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. All they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material."|1
"What? - that was it? The town sheriff (John Agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? With instrumentals by The Wildcats, ""Night Fright"" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. Remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb."|1
Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times . He may have made more classics than anyone else ever . He may also have made more anti-climactic ones than any of his peers . But for all of his strengths, he had one great weakness . His greatest strengths were his eyes . And with them, he would always take us on a journey. In his first film , he gave us what we would remember for a lifetime to come . He gave us something to dream about. But it was not a story about dreams . The story was the world .|0
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more similarly to this, there's Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie's a D-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it.|1
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good . Let me make it clear, this film is not for everyone . It is a film that you have to have seen to understand . The only way to understand is to watch the movie . There is no other way . Even after watching it, you will wonder how you lived without seeing it before . It is no secret that I was not a fan of the ’90s. This is especially the case when I was younger. I did not love the ’80s for the same reason.|0
"Like another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed this multiple times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel ""Return of the Ginat Majin"".Now I haven't seen it since then...but it never left me. Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically it isn't horror...until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. There's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them...to no avail."|1
If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me!|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie . Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending to society's norms. The film shows his life after that. It's really an interesting look at the lives of young adults in the 80's in a way that most people today can not understand. It had a great cast. The acting and directing were topnotch. This is one of the best movies of 1986. I had seen this movie many years before I got my VCR but never really took in to the movie.|0

"LCDR Tom Dodge , despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick ( * note to reader: I say ""reputation"" because I've never met a sailor who knows Dodge's reputation, and I have to imagine that I'd be hard pressed to name one sailor who does. The truth is, while Tom Dodge was known to the naval community as a master tactician, he wasn't liked by his peers, nor was he a particularly popular or easygoing person. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that Dodge had never met an officer or sailor who actually liked the guy."|0
"There is a difference between a ""film,"" and a ""movie."" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski's ""Donnybrook."" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the ""finished"" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie."|1
This movie made me so angry!! Here I am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. The scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must I go on? There are porno movies out with better dialog than this. I understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. This is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning.|1
"I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are not any movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said ""stupid"". I applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one."|1
I just watched The Dresser this evening , having only seen it once before , about a dozen years ago.It’s one of those films that is a bit of a classic , and one of my favourite films of the 60′s . I think , that it was a good movie to see . I think its a movie about a young lady who goes out to look for someone who she thinks might be the love of her life . When she finds him , she leaves him . She says , “I hope you’d love me and that’s what I really want.|0
Last night , I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ) . Oddly , the film has not received the same attention that other films that are more mainstream and more commercial have received. But it was a film which I would gladly recommend to someone . This was a film that was made almost 20 years ago and still stands the test of time . But it is not something which is likely to be forgotten by anyone who had a part in it . I have seen other films from other directors in other languages , and have come to realize that the film has its own language .|0
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off. Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. As an actor and filmmaker, I cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. Yet, I must admit, I could not look away.|1
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness. not only was the name a complete misnomer--since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas--but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately i waited until the end in my case. that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim.|1
I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film on Monday night and now I don't even know what to say about it. That is the problem with a film like this. There's really nothing you can do about it, but still, you feel like crap. You can blame the film, or the director. But it's a film, and it's in the film, and the film is about the film and it's a film and you know what? We're talking about a film!|0
"I probably have to blame myselfbut I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title ""Black Dragons"" and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one."|1
"This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the ""author"" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too."|1
"Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, ""Meet John Doe"" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital."|1
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. This is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts.|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen , and who will die . It is not very hard to tell at the very beginning of this film, who is going to marry who . But the real question is : what happens next ? The answer to that question is in the last half of the film , although the audience sees it only when it happens. I saw this movie with my dad, who is a film critic and I was in love with this movie the second I watched it.|0
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me.|1
Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I have n't seen or from her early movie career is a good one? I know they were doing a lot of films back in her youth but I don't know where I would start if I wanted to do a little research. Or is there an entire collection of her films I can search? I have no desire to watch a bunch of movies and have forgotten what she is about and don't know if I ever wanted to. Thanks in advance and a big thank you to any who answer this.|0
I realize most people do n't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much more casual. But I'll try to convince you anyway. Solomon Kane is a film which is based on true stories, but it is not about a real-life person. He was the first African American to ever win the Olympic gold medal in track and field. He also is the first African American to be an astronaut. Kane's story is about him being a pioneer in sports and a trailblazer in engineering. And he is one of the reasons why people don't just accept black history.|0
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but ""the"" icon for good-doers all over the world. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.Whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over Mr. Moore's treatment."|1
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish . I knew we were in for a wasted evening after reading the summary. The first two chapters are just a list of characters' names and their ages. I don't recall any plot from there on either. I've been reading through this one for several weeks now. It's like I've seen it already. For anyone interested I've got an older edition, and while it may be an older edition, I have to say that the story still holds up quite well to this edition.|0
I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script.|1
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. This may be the best film ever made about the AIDS crisis. It takes you into the mind of a person living with the disease, but you are not there to pity him. You are there to feel pity for the life he is leading. You feel for him as he slowly becomes one of the statistics in the HIV/AIDS statistic book. And then you see what the movie has become and you understand.|0
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are paper thin. The exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. The worst part of the entire movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.I can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced.|1
"Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films , and they do n't all have a lot of laughs or a good message, but the one he did that really stands out is called ""The Great Train Robbery"". It's the one that has a lot of humor in it and is probably the best one he ever made. I think it's great because you could see how he was going for comedy in it. It just has so much heart it's amazing. How long is the film? This is the third Buster Keaton film."|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set , under the title `` The Broken Skull . I thought the story and the art was great. It's the third book in the series but it's the first one that I've read. In the first book, "" The Broken Skull "" (I think) there are some big hints of where the characters are headed, and how they are going to handle the issues they are dealing with. In this new book, I don't get any hint of where the characters are headed or how they are handling things."|0
I can get over the political parody ; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a `` Masters of Horror '' novel, I have no idea what it's about or even whether it is supposed to be about anything at all... but it is indeed a rather silly story with a lot of bad acting and some poor writing and bad direction and bad costumes and bad acting and some very bad writing and bad direction and lots of bad writing. It's one of these books that I wish had never happened. I really, honestly, sincerely wish this story had never been written.|0
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really wish I had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh.|1
"The title, although singular, will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this ""thing"" has absolutely nothing to do with ""Freaks"" or even with the art of professional film-making in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. Yeah right The person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe!"|1
If this movie had been directed by a man , he would have been jailed . While Adrian Lyne was given the lead , it is the woman who really shines . As an actress who has a lot going on , I could not help but enjoy the story she tells . She is believable as the love interest , while also being capable of carrying the lead . This film does not shy away from its sexuality and does have some nudity . If you are looking for a good romantic comedy with heart , then this is one to look at .|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori. That might be true but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced.|1
OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart.|1
"This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the ""suspense"" of Disney's Snow White, was chuckling through out the entire movie. My first warning should've been that it was in the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But I have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can't fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the DVD, it was actually $3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies."|1
Not a balanced point of view . The director should n't express her opinion as truth . The movie has been a failure in many parts and I do not have the confidence to watch it again. I have no faith in her ability and I am sure that she is going to mess up again . An excellent film. I am not sure I would have picked up the book if I never heard of it but it was really enjoyable to see in the movie. The story was intriguing, and I enjoyed how it was written and delivered.|0
"I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher wasn't involved with this ""movie"". An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't make an appearance in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs."|1
The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84).|1
In Michele Soavi 's confusing art-house zombie film , Dellamorte Dellamore , Rupert Everett plays Francesco , a caretaker in an Italian villa overrun by the living dead. The only one who can speak to him, his wife Anna, (Natalie Portman) has been dead for 12 days. It turns out this is her husband's doing: he is using his dead wife as a conduit for his undead daughter. When the dead start rising, Rupert is forced to flee with a few of his friends in a car, while Anna flees in a boat with her young daughter (Anna Di Lago).|0
"The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I 've yet run across. I'm surprised I didn't hear anyone say: ""Hey, isn't that Hercules? What the heck happened to the rest of the movie?"" This film tells the tale of Hercules and his quest to find a wife for his crippled brother, Iphicles. After all, if Hercules isn't married, how can he become strong and growl like a werewolf? This was the film I saw when I was thirteen, and I wasn't very impressed."|0
It 's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of talent or even resources have the power to conjure up an entire mythology of their own, not least of all when it comes to their own experiences. In the case of the Coen Brothers, I've been thinking about that for a good few years now. Their most recent movie is called Inside Llewyn Davis and its story of an old bluesman named Robert Hunter is based partly on his life story, especially the events of the 1990s.|0
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land , using the land for grazing to pay for infrastructure upgrades that will help his company. A little over a mile down the road from Prairie City is a much larger community. In the town of Poygan, near the Texas border, there is a small farming community with several hundred people. Some of the farmers live on farms in the surrounding area, while others own cattle in the valley. There is a small ranching community as well, a mile down Highway 6 in Poygan.|0
I am a firm believer that a film, TV serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-80's on TV and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the full series DVD set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me.|1
Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will 's `` genius '' is concerned . Not just in math -- in all things. In that, he's far from alone. I, and millions like me, take it on faith that he's right because he seems so darn smart. If he claims, for example, that 1+2+... is 3, and then proves it mathematically, you've got to give him credit because it's just so hard to believe. You'll never catch him saying something, though, because he never does.|0
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film.|1
"My website ( www.theflickguy.org ) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time . Here is an excerpt :

""When the credits start rolling at the end of the movie, and the screen goes blank for about ten seconds, we're forced to confront the fact that The Flick is really not that terrible after all."" ""What's this guy talking about? I had to leave my seat to make sure I caught the movie. How can I possibly be expected to watch something so boring? How can anyone watch such an awful piece of filth for two hours?"|0
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the ""thief"" was obvious. It was a poor man's (not to mention high school) ""Less than Zero"". I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. So many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. Avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst."|1
"I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious ; It 's not like American Pie or something . In fact, the thing that struck me as funny was that people laughed at it ! I 'm not sure why people laughed so much ! I 'd like to make a list of all my favorite things :

1. My best friends are my best friends and I am very lucky for that.2. The first thing I remember about this day is my dad telling me that he was happy to have me for his son and that he loved me very much for that."|0
So , this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see . It 's up there with `` Crossbones '' , but not even close. I just wish I could have seen it with other people. At least I wouldn 't be sitting in the theatre alone , hoping that the film would be so terrible that my friends would turn the sound off and try to keep me calm until I got home and then they could talk about it in hushed tones . I just want to be able to sit back and enjoy it , and talk about it , and have some fun .|0
In my opinion , a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and fun to watch, as well as have a sense of truth and integrity . A documentary that I enjoyed was one on the American Civil War ( The Burden of Empire ) . It was interesting because it showed that in the Civil War there were some positive sides to it and some not so good side. It made me look at history from an entirely different perspective, I was able to understand more fully what the good and the bad sides were.|0
"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species."|1
I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.What I AM bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL of the episodes were staged. Hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.The premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer.|1
This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.Dont come to this movie expecting the Matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie.|1
"I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT ? ? That is why this site is so successful ? Here is the short version

1. I am a gay male with HIV,

I live in a country where there is a well-known gay-panic group,

I have been an outspoken gay activist in my city and have even made several trips to Europe and the US to work with HIV organizations and speak at conferences

I have done all of this and still have a lot more work to do."|0
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie , thought of two or three funny and stupid things and then told that to the movie director . That is why this movie is funny . The director did not know about the fact that you are watching a movie and that is the main reason why that you laugh at some funny and stupid thing , the director does not know what it is. The reason that the audience laughs is not because of the director's idea. This is a movie that will make you laugh out loud .|0
"Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.This film is about a young boy, Alejandro ""Ale"" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar ""Izzie"" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (that I did not even know existed--Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops."|1
"While not as bad as some movies (like the horrible ""Atomic Twister""), ""Meltdown"" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a Masters Degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.Riding the false fear that a Chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an American plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area."|1
I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off, I have been telling everyone who knows me about the movie. I think the only thing that saved me from throwing it from my screen was the amazing soundtrack by the Beatles and the fact that the actor who played the lead was an incredibly good looking woman, it was all too much at the time I had seen this movie for me to continue to watch. I could not be more pleased that she is back, I love that movie I will watch it again.|0
Boy Oh Boy , does this movie stink . This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever seen. I watched it yesterday and after seeing all the torture scenes, I was shocked. The story was not bad but the acting sucked. It was all fake and I was so disappointed in the whole thing, I couldn't believe that the movie was made. It didn't feel real. I just thought they were trying too hard to make this movie. All the actors just seemed too fake. I'm not really a movie guy but this movie kind of ruined me.|0
"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome . I am not an expert in the history of Rome but there were some interesting facts I came to know, which I could share here:

I will start by giving the facts in chronological order, in the form of a story. At the beginning, the Roman Republic lasted about 200 years , until the assassination of Julius Caesar in 45 BC. The Roman Senate, with the help of a group of senators, decided to hold the election of a new President to ensure continuity of government."|0
This is one of those movies that has everything in it . I do n't think I would get tired of this one for a second. It is so well done it's almost painful . I have seen it three or four times I think and it always makes me feel so happy at the end. Not because it makes me happy but because it makes me appreciate life and being alive in every way . It makes me wonder how I could live a life where I never did anything and never will. I have been there and I think I can explain it to you .|0

That's all I can really say about this film. It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series. The action is pretty nice in general. The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Pretty good in general, there... The problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff.|1
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his Japanese gangster films , especially in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has made several films in other countries. Fukasaku started his career in 1960 when he graduated from film school and directed a series of student films , the best known of which was an adaptation of Oedipus Rex, but he struggled with his first real job as an assistant director on a low-budget samurai film. After two years he had enough money for a film to be completed , and Fukasaku shot his first full-length movie in 1965.|0
This film was really terrible.However , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed at that for a long time.There were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that I found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end.|1
While it 's not `` perfect '' , it 's close . Love Barbara Stanwyck , SZ Sakall , Sidney Poitier , and Richard Chamberlain . It may not be the masterpiece of a perfect movie . It has its flaws . Some of which I will address later . but for now , let me tell you what I did not see in the film . The movie stars the great SZ Sakall as a woman who is very successful , but is very lonely , and wants to meet a man who is very successful to help her become happy . The man , in real life , is Richard Chamberlain .|0
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell work.I had a few friends over one night,and we did a couple of rolls of film on the deck of our boat.I was about halfway through when Jim turned up,and he asked me to come out to his house for dinner.It was a great story.He was a good sport.I didn't know him from Adam,but I found myself wanting to be nice to the man I'd spent the past six months working with.And so I went.|0
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city. A low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. The finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then.|1
`` While sporadically engrossing ( including a few effectively tender moments ) and humorous , the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming ' is a fine introduction to the craft and style of Woody Allan . . . And it does not disappoint as the story unravels and the music and lyrics grow with each new page . . . If you're a fan of 'American Psycho' , you might find it surprising that 'Diary of a Country Song' and 'Homecoming' are so close in style and tone . . . In fact, 'Diary ' is not just a parody but a direct parody of Allan's own work .|0
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles . Even if you attempt to be a smartass and don’t mention the obvious (which is, you know, impossible) you’ll still be exposed as a liar. If you’ve been on the internet for long you’ll know the drill: the moment you start talking you’re already a douchebag, and everyone who disagrees with you, including you, are a dick. And then they’ll go on to make you a dick.|0
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today. Many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. From the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand.|1
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money, she becomes Brown's property.|1
The Mod Squad is n't a movie , it 's a void . That 's the most fascinating thing about the whole thing . The movie itself is boring , I can't think of the last time I've ever laughed so hard at a piece of crap . In the words of one of the movie's characters , ' Why bother?' The movie is about a bunch of bored people who get bored of their own lives . So what does the movie do? It makes us want to watch it. The problem is , as we watch it , we start to realize that there is actually a plot .|0
"I agree with all the comments posted so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. Terrible CGI, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing has got to be the Native American angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions (""Do not do this thing! ""), Native American pipes playing in thin air, etc."|1
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short. ""The Grinch"" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. I used to like him very much in his ""Waynes World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and ""the Cat In The Hat"" has just finished me off."|1
"After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his ""Masterpiece"" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.So I have at least these five questions in my mind:1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Stéphanois. He couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car."|1
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending. Heartwarming performances, action, humor, and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget.|1
I could n't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a little difficult to watch, at least it was for me at the end when the movie ended, so I thought I'd make a video about it as I didn't like this movie too much. I think I like the movie a bit more than the other ones in this section so I'm going to leave this one out of this section. Also, this is probably the longest movie in this section so if you have time, I suggest watching this movie.|0
Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job.Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.|1
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM. I'll explain why.1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film'.|1
go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam. despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the cliché writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam.|1
At first I did n't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky , but as her career has progressed I have found it to be far more entertaining. I am a fan girl , and I can say that for Lauren Ambrose, she is one of the finest porn stars to ever live. I have watched every video Lauren has made, and I have to say she is the most talented and beautiful woman on the planet. Lauren is my favorite pornstar by far and I am looking forward to seeing what happens with the next few movies Lauren does.|0
"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory."|1
the worst sequel I've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny.|1
"- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -Not presenting itself as yet another remake of ""The Interview"", Five Fingers actually is. Alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. In fact, Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level. What I found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted out his ordeal."|1
If you came here , it 's because you 've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it. If you did not like this movie, please leave immediately. No more of this kind of crap. I don 't want to hear you complain that you had a bad time at the movies, or that it 's not your kind of film. The problem is that you didn't know anything about it beforehand, because you went to see it for the first time without any context, as if that makes it any better or worse.|0
"The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys any and all things, the Bible claims to be true. To people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called ""blasphemy"", and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear, that many people think of it as a good sequel to the Bible. However, the film shows you a lot of things and subjects, that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the ""Revelation""."|1
Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you.|1
OK , Number one-this `` film '' is a `` 90 's '' version of a crappy show from the 90s that I can't see any connection to . The only reason that this movie has any value at all is that the cast is hot and the story is kind of cool . I could have seen this in a video store for like $5 but this is not a video store release . It's a straight-up DVD release . I'll give the film a 1 out of 4 stars . I'm not sure if there's something that you could take away from the movie .|0
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a building and is jailed for life. In prison he finds himself in a battle of wills with the head of the Irish Republicans , Michael Stone ( who is played by William Devane ). Both men are former soldiers and have fought against the British throughout the war . In an attempt to escape the prison walls they take the fight to the British. After escaping from the prison one of them kills a prison guard and the other kills another.|0
As far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries anyone? ), this one is up there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it aims for. In recent light of events (Guantanamo) this movie is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of it's time, when it was released in the 70s! One can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): Screw the politicians and politics in general.|1
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y.|1
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai 's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit with its new soundtrack  I can honestly say, I don't see the movie in the same context as when I first watched it. It's not because I now have better access to Wong's body of work; I didn't see the film when it came out either. It's just that it no longer strikes me the same way. That is to say, there's a new film in there, a film I haven't thought of since it first emerged in 1994.|0
Ah the sci-fi channel . How often do you disappoint me ? Quite often I think , do you ever disappoint ? The channel I thought I would find interesting in terms of sci-fi was SyFy channel. The show that I thought I would find interesting was called Continuum . This is the show that shows the human body in space. We have the humans on Earth with their technology, but what about them on a space station ? What are the medical and psychological challenges that they have to deal with as well as how are they to deal with them.|0
I still remember watching Satya for the first time . I was completely blown away . Here was a movie that had no sex , drugs or violence. A perfect love story . Satya is not just a film but a philosophy of life that you must live in order to be alive . What makes Satya such an important film to me is that there was no compromise with the message . A film like Satya has to touch the lives of the masses . In order to touch the lives of the masses , you have to touch their emotions .|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that?There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests."|1
SPOILER WARNINGWe 've all heard the `` Boy Who Cried Wolf '' legend . But what if the wolf was right and we actually do face an imminent nuclear holocaust? In this article we investigate what would happen if the nuclear warheads, which we all think we are ready to use, suddenly disappeared? Could we survive? And, would it really make any difference in the end? This article was originally published on The Huffington Post , and is re-posted with permission. As a reminder, the nuclear arms race is currently at a very high boil.|0
"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990."|1
lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more.|1
Honestly , how hard can it be to make a good remake ? Obviously pretty hard ! I was soooo happy to hear they did one of their own , that's all i can really say . I hope they do one again , and make one better than this time . Well , i just watched this movie again a month ago . I think the movie was good , but I didn't like the ending . I would've preferred if they would've made a sequel to the movie , as I liked how they did the movie . Anyway , i've never liked this movie much .|0
First the premise stinks ... little boy likes to dress in girls clothes . It reminded me of Norman Bates in Hitchcock's film Psycho (1960) . He dressed up in women's clothes for some reason and then he killed people in that outfit. The first time I watched the movie was when a friend of mine watched the film with his son and his daughter. They were in tears. I think I cried the whole time too. I was just so scared. That was a very intense scene in a scary film. Here's another interesting fact.|0
If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man 's testicle , or look at a row of pathetically tiny testicles , go to an anatomy lab , or to a bar. What you'll probably see is someone vomiting after having drunk too much. They'll be more interested in sex with strangers than with other people, and they'll spend the majority of their time at the bar. They won't be thinking about their careers, and they won't care about what they can do to better themselves. It is the only way to get over a breakup.|0
"1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mark Dindal ) : Fast-paced , frantic animation effort by Ted Adams. Very few animation films ( if any ) have been made so much with so few drawings. Most animated films attempt to make a complete story, which is an impossible endeavor, but Adams did it with the animation in this film, which is the story of one young man's journey from innocence to maturity. 0

2nd watched 8/8/2001 - 2 out of 10 ( Ted Adams ) : As I was reading about the film on another site I came upon Ted's review of the film."|0
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ""gem."" This one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on VHS from an arcade on 42nd st. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. But, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse film. This film could replace water-boarding as a humane method of interrogation. No, I take that back - I would prefer water-boarding."|1
"Was excited at the opening to hear part of ""Chevaliers De Sangreal"" but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks?"|1
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff film. I guess I'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties.|1
This film has made e mad. I believe the original of this film ,'The Mask', was an awesome film, worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when i saw this, i thought again.This film has spoilt the whole idea of 'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother who is seven didn't even laugh, and he is into these childish movies, but this was worse. A load of crap!!|1
This show started out okay , but then it turned into a nightmare . The worst part about it was how many times did they come in the same order . They are always in the same order , and we have to listen the same time . This is what we have come to expect from this show , even when they changed the order a couple of times , as they tried to make it more commercial and more exciting , they didn’t succeed . This show used to start out okay , then they would change everything .|0
Firstly , let me make it clear that I love aircraft , and usually any film with them in is one of my favs to watch . However, I have to be honest , I hate planes . I just do . Even if they are super cool planes , they just give me an instant migraine. Yes, it is me , and that is my biggest pet peeve , and my biggest downfall with the film industry . I love the idea of making an aircraft , but it just doesn't do it for me . They are so cool, but i just get sick when i see them .|0
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that did n't really show the quality of the making of the film. I felt that I was a bit spoiled by the fact that it looked so much like a movie that would have been made in the 50s. However, as I always say, it was made for people who never had an allowance or were too shy to ask for money, and that is a shame really as to be honest, I enjoyed it. The movie is full of wonderful performances by the actors.|0
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts , and to be honest , I did n't know what a driving lesson was till I attended one! But I'm so glad that I did! My lessons with Darren have been absolutely amazing! They are all really professional and he made me so much more confident driving in a car! He is so good at his job and he has a really great personality. He is great with the children and really friendly too! So if you are ever thinking of going to one of his lessons , go for it!|0
"""Escape from Hell"" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the ""fake plague"" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it."|1
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great . I 've heard a couple of things from others but this is the first I 've actually seen in print . I think it is a little over the top. I thought I was going to get a copy on ebay for a few months and then nothing . Finally a local used book dealer saw an old copy in the window of a used bookstore and offered to buy the book for a good price . I took him up on it and was able to get a copy .|0
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such,there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more.|1
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book . As written by Rafael Sabatini , this is his best work, which should be seen as a masterpiece by every one of us who has read and understand the book. I really liked the story line, especially the ending, but the script is very, very boring and repetitive. If you read the book, you can tell that there are many different styles and characters, but they are all very, very boring. I think I'm going to stop watching this series.|0
No pun intended . I 'm not going to spoil anything about the story , but it 's safe to say there 's no way I will ever read it . I also won 't spoil anything else about the movie either . I just want to mention that this is the last movie I will ever see . But I guess that is not a spoiler . As you can tell , I am an emotional person and I will always be attached to the characters in this book . I want to thank my husband for being the constant support . I am so lucky to have him by my side .|0
( This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie , however it may change one 's expectations when the movie was released . ) - The film was a complete success , at least in Europe . The critics loved it , the audience went to see the movie in theaters . - The movie was also very successful in many Asian countries , and is a great success in Japan as well . I guess it 's one of the best examples of Asian box office success of a non-English movie . - The movie was also a success in Latin America .|0
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like ""Pistolero"", ""Comanche"" and ""The Gent"" I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while ""CC Rider"" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable."|1
Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent which is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. At least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor.|1
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her great fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection.|1
"The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling . if you have any doubts about what the film is made of then please see for your self the opening credits : 

if you haven't heard of the film before then it is the story of a woman who finds herself locked in the cellar of a derelict hotel after a suicide attempt , the film follows her descent into madness while she attempts to rescue her husband who's been shot in the street , the film is directed by an unknown man and is in black and white ."|0
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood . Its hard to believe it is a movie that came out in 2013. If you are going to a movie this year please don't bother with this movie. It is one of the most boring movies I had seen in the last couple of years. But I have heard some critics saying that it's good. It's a shame there are no sequels because the movie was a hit, but then it was a sequel and a few critics hated it too.|0
Of the thousands of movies I 've seen so far , this is the first one which made me think about and think about the things I want in a film. It's the kind of movie that makes me wonder what's going on inside people's heads. There are moments where I actually feel sorry for them. Like when the little girl asks what her favourite thing is . I mean, this is clearly an innocent question, but one which makes me think that people would probably say that they love their families and their kids.|0
I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it . So charming and so touching . I hope that this turns out like that but I am not so sure. I don’t know how to put it. I just know I cannot wait to see this movie for my husband. Thanks for the recommendation. This is a very good movie! I love your review. I have seen this film many times and it is the first time that the film made me cry. This film should be seen by all.|0
It's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.The cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout.|1
As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood . In the scene where the dog grabs the ball, the actor should have held the ball in his mouth but he had to keep hitting it with his paw. Thats why he is trying to pull it out of his mouth. You don't think there are some people out there that don't think that way? You may have to get up to speed on evolution. The earth has been a planet with life since the very beginning (billions of years). Well, that's not true, it was just a few million years ago.|0
"well , i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now available on dvd. it's not a very good film, but i found it to be a very interesting movie . i don't plan on re-watching it now. it's just too bad the film was so widely distributed that a lot of people have never even seen it. in any case, here's an excerpt: 
"" the film takes us to the city of chicago where a number of children have been brutally murdered during a school-year."|0
I have read almost all the books by now , and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I just wanted to say how much i liked the songs. They fit well into all the book characters. I would have liked the musical production more had I seen it in English. I think it would have benefited greatly if the original songs in the book were sung by the characters rather than translated, but then I would not have enjoyed it much more. I do like both versions, but the English version is very much a part of the plot.|0
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie but when I read the book it became clear that was not going to happen for me. This was because of the content that was not acceptable for me even though I do not agree with all that the book was saying. It is like going through the looking glass into a darker world and this is the reason I did not like the movie. It is one of the most amazing books I have read but I think it could be improved upon.|0
Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet.|1
Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie -- who woulda thought ? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed and I still like his work but not this one. It is a good film but I think this is just the first of the two films he directed that has a chance to really make a mark in his filmography. I think this is a very good movie with just a couple of things I think could have been improved. However, he did a better job on this film than he did on his previous one. I saw the film last night and just had to write about it for you.|0
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I couldn't understand more than about 15%(the fancy English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. Didn't find it funny, didn't find it amusing, didn't find any sense in it.|1
Dictated by thin experience ( of both life and industry ) and no cash Sofia Coppola 's early short is the first ever movie to have come out without any outside financial support. Yet the story it tells – about a family torn apart by a sudden death – could easily be mistaken for a horror film. No-one can doubt Sofia Coppola’s talent – but it’s not for nothing that she was able to build a career as a novelist, screenwriter and director. So it comes as a surprise to read the first screenplay she has written herself.|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in.|1
But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there isn't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims.|1
Ho Hum . Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and smashing faces. It was pretty funny to watch, with a good dose of humor. I was expecting it to be much darker, but it was pretty light. I'm not sure it's the best action movie, but it did what it did well, and Seagal and his team of misfits was on top form , and had an endearing story line to tell. The only downside is that it had so many twists, and I would have like to see the film without the twist at the end .|0
"My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. The movie ""Babas bilar"" must be just about the worst film I ever seen. I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper."|1
I can only say this : ee03128 from Portugal , I could n't say it better . The worst movie I've seen so far this year , but not as bad as others . The story is very good and the actors are better than usual . And I have a bad taste for this movie and I didn't understand a thing . I'll watch the other two films , but this one is so so . The plot was very predictable , but this was the worst I've seen . I understand the people who liked this , but for me this was very bad .|0
"Although I saw this movie in Korea , in Korean , and therefore did not understand the language , images, etc , I was really interested in the fact that the director and the actors were in Korea for a film set in Korea with a couple of American actors in it . So, I went to the Korean website and looked for the trailer, and I could tell that it was a "" Korean version "" . The trailers for the movie that I saw looked very different . They were very American . The movie is about an American man , and his Korean friend ."|0
This movie had an excellent premise , and could have been a fascinating look at racism , attitudes to women , homophobia , sexism , and other forms of bigotry in America , all wrapped up in a great yarn . the problem is that it does not tell you what you are going to see , nor who is going to appear in the role of the villain . it is also quite confusing , as the film is told from three different points of view , one from a white girl , one from a black girl and one from an interracial couple .|0
Another first: this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Perhaps I'm a bit hasty when I say that this is probably my last Rohmer movie but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought was never going to end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. He struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air.|1
It's 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So, why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible. Just...don't...watch it. I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child produced this entire movie.|1
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want . I'm pretty much the same in this regard. If you're an anime fan and want to know what I think about something then go ask. You might think that I can't help but have a different opinion from someone else. But the truth is that I'm not an expert in what anime fans want. I'm not an expert in what Anime directors want to achieve. And I'm not an expert in what fans want either.|0
"The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of ""Drake & Josh"" fame, personally I'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier) and the ""Rick Punchers"" joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom."|1
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. Anyroad, here's a few things I learned about Mexico from watching this film.~All Mexican Women Are Super Hot - Remember that little desert town in Unearthed? Yeah, well, this must be it's Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. She'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~Half of Mexico is controlled by insane Satan-worshiping Palo Mayombe cultists.|1
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley part of the Southern states of America where they live. She gets all excited about him taking her to bed once a week and showing her his cock. She is a virgin. She is not sure what to do and she does not even know how to pleasure herself. So she does not want to have sex. She wants to take a nice long walk in the moonlight to get her mind straightened out. She walks into a bedroom in her own house.|0
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer . It has even been called a parody of that. I guess people don't really know what to expect from this film. I will let you in on a few things, though. First of all you will meet the main character, the daughter of a drug dealer who finds herself involved with a gang of gangsters. This is where it begins. Then you meet the main girl's mother. You meet the gang that is trying to kill her son.|0
The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French `` Emmanuelle 2 . '' This amazing scene, which opens the latest movie in a French erotic comedy series , is so provocative that Gemser has not been asked to appear again in the series since its beginning, and it's the only erotic movie which has ever been nominated for an Oscar (and won an Emmy). In addition to the erotic scenes in `` Emmanuelle 1 and 2 , '' there is also a full-length lesbian scene, and a scene featuring a sex scene between two men and a third woman.|0
Let's get right to the heart of the matter...This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead Actors look like they were forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in pain.|1
Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane! '; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits.|1
"Why bother , ITV ? Admittedly , Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to `` get , '' he said in an interview , ''but it is one of the most difficult to `` get over . '' ''

I know Mansfield Park is the more difficult of the novels to `` get , '' Mr. Mansfield said in an interview with The Times . He also added that he would `` be surprised if he had written another book at the time he wrote Mansfield Park . '' Mr. Mansfield said Mansfield Park is the only novel by him that he is `` still angry at . ''"|0
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along.|1
The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I 've ever seen . Aside from the lack of logic and factual basis , I think the script is quite good and would be very watchable , but I find it more disturbing than entertaining . It is a real downer and I think we all would be happier if there was a big bomb going off on this Bridge . I think the film would have to suffer greatly for its inclusion , but I don't think I would be alone , considering how bad most war films are now .|0
I have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly). The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember having seen it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been released on DVD or VHS although I shall browse around for a copy.The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young, mute Irish wife.|1
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations , Blade is by far one of the best realised. The book has been adapted four times and it has been translated into multiple languages with a fifth being in the works. All of these versions have had the same basic concept, that is, to update a classic tale with a modern twist. The most recent of these comic adaptations was published by Marvel back in 2008. In the comic, Blade is an anti-hero in a future where vampires live alongside humans, in this world he is known as Blade 2049.|0
"Oh my God... where to begin? ""Chupacabra Terror"" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes ""Demon Slayer"" look like ""The Exorcist"". Special note: A Horror B-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a hot girl in this one. With that inexcusable mistake, I should begin with the complete bash.First of all, if you're going to make a Horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a ""cool"" monster outfit."|1
"I'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first ""Road"" picture I've seen. I was expecting waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of the Road movies. If that's true I needn't bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.I didn't like the movie."|1
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable.|1
This movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good. It is truly appalling. Its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but alas they were serious. Made for TV, but not worthy of even that. It contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh will he save the town from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I cant explain how bad this is. Awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy.|1
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's ""cool"" to hate, like ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" or ""The Avengers"") I ask them, ""is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? Does anyone utter the line 'I'd rather eat a turd' in that movie? ""This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children."|1
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen . The story line is a joke , the effects are horrible and worst of all the acting by the cast is pathetic. The story line is terrible , they made up some stupid story line which makes it worse, the effects were just horrible, I cannot watch the movie with my girlfriend or friends because I'm so upset with the acting of the cast. There was a point in this movie where I laughed , then I felt really sorry for the character . It just ruined my whole day

So, I just finished watching this."|0
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? GIANT cgi versions of these beasts which battle! However I do require one of the guns used in the movie. Because apparently they are using cheats. Count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. Regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.The sound effects used in the movie for the Komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. Oh and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealthy as hell?|1
"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I can't see why. It's beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark"". The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows."|1
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests...|1
OK , I 've seen over 100 Troma films , and some of them are pretty bad . `` Sizzle ! `` was an exception and is now one of my favorite movies. It's an interesting movie in a number of ways . First, I don't like the movie itself . I know a lot of people like it , but I'm not one of them. It's not very good , I'll grant you , it's not great , but it's definitely not bad. I think Troma could have made a better movie and they didn't , which is strange .|0
i don't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones. when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off, but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires, a combination that i thought could not fail. That is until i popped this into my DVD player.|1
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since that gay kid (Ben) came along, this show has sucked. The writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse.|1
William Petersen ( that C.S.I guy ) has a small uncredited role but it 's the best part of the film, I 'm a fan and it makes up for the fact that you can't even tell this is an uncredited role, there are no other actors and the music is very different. This is a classic film of the 70's that I think is underrated by people like myself and others like me who think it should be seen on the big screen instead of seen on tv. It's a really funny movie but also has a tragic side to it.|0
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple.|1
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - SHOCK - it's an X-File.To me - it's cool that Scully/Mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).Oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? Or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work.|1
'The Dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.As 'Sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'King Lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times.|1
NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't allow my children to see this. I definitely would tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof as to why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network The producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot wasn't even born when this event took place. Did anyone attached to this project try reading the Bible?|1
The reviewer in Variety said this was `` overwritten and overlong '' , and I kind of agree with it. There are too many characters to care about and not enough meat on them. I think they were trying to say something. I was just hoping it was not going to get cancelled. I like this film but there is so much good writing and acting it is hard for me to focus. I can't find any fault with their acting but I think the writing is overrated. I think the writing can do so much better.|0
"Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies (e.g. the English Patient), but have far less appeal.After the first half-hour I started checking my watch, wondering if I'd make it home in time to catch Leno on tv.I passed up ""Gladiator"" to see this!? !"|1
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way.|1
I always loved this film. The music,story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte' after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam.|1
Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime pictures (particularly Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need, and was ahead of its time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-WW2 France. Its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off.|1
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, Washington's is OK, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-stretched CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (Some Spoilers hereafter!)|1
"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12"" x 10"". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment."|1
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous.|1
Okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. So, does he ask his father for the dough? Nope, he STEALS IT and gets caught. Kids, if I'm ever turned invisible, I'll advance your allowance, ok?|1
Beware, My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I did.A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside.|1
Some movies you watch and you say , `` Well , that made no sense . '' And you do not see a way to bring it back to life. This is the first movie I saw where you could see why someone made the decision to make a film and you knew that they were not making a poor film. I thought, I can get back at this thing, I’ll put my best foot forward here and do it the way I would do a better film. So, with that said , the film is an interesting movie.|0
After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time.|1
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen (with the exception of this and Affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way.|1
"That is the answer. The question is: What is the single reason to watch this movie? I loved her in ""My Name Is Julia Ross."" That is one of the best films noir of all time. Noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. That would be ""The Guilt Of Janet Ames."" This one has a spooky, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a fine director. I was expecting something dark."|1
I 'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer , ex-rugby player , and ex-boxer , and I love this movie.It's one of a few movies that make me feel like I'm a man and a real one.It's the last of its kind. It's one of a few movies that make me feel like I'm a man and a real one.It's the last of its kind. That's why I love it. At the same time I'm not a man. I am a woman. And I'm gay, but I feel like I could be someone else.|0
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher Graduation Day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.What it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!|1
when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE, Which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, Andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. And lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me Well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. And to make things worse i have the whole set on DVD fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche.|1
"First , let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel , so maybe I am directing too much blame at the author, and I have to confess that I could be wrong…

In his defense, however, you have to admit that in Balzac’s case, at least, it wasn’t his fault. It wasn’t because the story was written in 1842 and he didn’t know about it, either. It isn’t because we didn’t read it. In fact, we’re not exactly sure where it was written."|0
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance.|1
I just got back from `` AGS '' . After seeing it , I 'm convinced that no matter how good the movie is, no matter who is in the lead role and whether the movie is any good at all, you 'd be wise to read up on what happened to it before going to see it. It makes a lot of things clear, and it is one of the best films I have seen in a very long, very long time. You know why it 's one of the best? The reason for that may sound strange but in fact it makes a lot of sense.|0
"My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of ""bad"" movies. Among the flicks we watched, the strongest contender (for quality bad-movie fare) was easily Jack-O. It's ludicrous that movies such as ""Gigli"", ""Glitter"" and ""You Got Served"" are listed in IMDBs bottom 100. While they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. They're robbing ""Jack-O"", and ""Keeper of Time"", etc, of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve.So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)?"|1
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he has been investigating Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans.|1
From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again. This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema.The story is needlessly told in flashback style. All of the 'present' sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. I never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.The story self also isn't exactly the greatest. It isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell.|1
Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure. The main problem is that there is no point of having a comedy, if everyone knows that it's just a joke to be made, and it's just the audience laughing for no reason at all. The audience never laughs in the cinema (except when someone laughs because they have seen it a thousand times already) , so why not make the movie a comedy , just like in real life, so it makes people laugh.|0
My first post at the IMDb has to ( unfortunately ) be to warn others not to waste their time with the film. I mean, there’s not really that much to the story. I’m not sure why this one is so widely regarded as a great movie, but it was a great movie. If you’re going to see the movie, then I would recommend it to you without hesitation. However, this is a really boring movie. It’s almost a documentary. It’s basically a history lesson on the history of silent cinema.|0
This is a crummy film , a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies . And a genre that I loathe anyway . I have seen a dozen of these films in my life and can never, ever be tempted back to the cinema . Never! I was expecting a film of great emotional resonance and intensity but it had none . This is a film which I watched with my husband on Saturday night as my children were playing on a laptop in the background and I had the TV on. It is not that I did not like the film .|0
"Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - ""eXistenZ"" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (""P.R. nerd"") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth."|1
"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said ""wow what a good movie."" Someone actually walked out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough."|1
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it wasn't good. Actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to Nora Roberts.I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, Forlani wasn't alone.|1
As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra BS that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. Well...this was that piece of crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. The only half-witted acting came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies.|1
Oh yes , I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash . And in my defence , my wife did tell me about it , I did not read it . But that is a very different thing to having a piece of filth of this kind as a guest in our house . It is bad enough as a guest to our house , it is downright criminal as the guest to our guesthouse . We as the owner of this property , must be very clear about what we are doing and why .|0
Although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. It's just that most of us looked to the X-Files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV.In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker.|1
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made??|1
This film stinks more than limburger cheese ! If you find this at a garage sale , LEAVE IT THERE !!!!!!! If you find it on a shelf at a supermarket , I would say you are wrong. Go to a movie theater and take a couple of aspirin before you sit back down. You don’t want to be like me, I have a headache waiting at the theater door . A good movie should make you want to sit back and take a long time to think about it . I have to admit , this film does not do it .|0
Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.I know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a God. All great questions, But I really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed but come on.|1
Even though this film's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor (and I do mean Minor) character if this movie was suppose to being told by Sally's very own family! I mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history, would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character? His other lover (who happens to be white) as the actual love interest?|1
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand).|1
A gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's holiday. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...Blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but to little avail. What should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard but that's it.|1
Ok , when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations . Yes , the acting is poor . The plot is pretty good and there are some great songs , but it's a shame I had to cancel it . I'm hoping the sequel is worth the wait . I have to say , this movie is so good I don't want to spoil it for you . I'll just say this is a must watch movie . You have to see the original . The sequel is even better . I would give this movie 4 stars if the sequel doesn't exist .|0
One of low budget horror schlockmeister actor , John Carradine 's more animated roles as a implied Nazi scientist , 'Dr. Gernot Kruger' and his assistant , 'Iris', are the subject of a new two-part documentary series premiering on April 15th at 6:00 p.m., ET/PT on the PBS station ' P.A.T.V .'. The first hour features interviews with both actors and footage of their screen tests from 1956 . The second hour delves into the role of Kruger , who plays a scientist in a Nazi regime whose experimentation with human mind control (and the potential use of hypnosis) is a major theme of the movie.|0
I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form.|1
I just saw this movie . I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent , like all movies that come out of Japan. But the movie was not about that,it was about love.I thought it was a great movie . I can not say that it was one of the best I have seen.And I did not expect to like it. It was an unexpected surprise to me. but I can say that this movie touched me deeply. I liked the ending. I liked the story. It made me feel the loneliness of the characters.|0
Jack Higgins ' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into `` one last job '' ( where have I heard that before?). Higgins is a fine writer. He is also a fine teacher, and a very fine writer's teacher. Here's his lesson for aspiring writers. And here's the last paragraph. This lesson, as I am about to explain, does not have anything to do with writing or being a teacher, or being a good writer or a bad writer, or writing well, or not being a bad writer or being one of those writers.|0
"Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought ""Well if he likes it then I gotta like it!"" So I rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy)."|1
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM . We had never seen the film , even though we have seen the television series of the same name and it is the most popular television show in our household. But we had heard a lot about the film from our son, and it was an early Christmas present from him and his sister. So, we sat down and watched the film. Now, I want to say here that I am NOT a fan of the Christmas films. I think that they can be overdone, and even a little cheesy in some ways that are often taken too far in others.|0
While this is horribly dated, I MUST insist...PLEASE, NO REMAKE! Frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.The novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. I'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what I mean.|1
"Awful in a whole new way, ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a ""vanity"" production. I am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as Isabel Gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of ""lookers"" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie."|1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.|1
Going into the movie with the right expectations , I somewhat liked this movie . Like most reviewers who have come across it , I was quite impressed by how well the director managed to capture the true essence of the period while also maintaining a contemporary feel . And I think the main reason I liked it was the fact that it had some great performances from its stars and the story line , in general , was interesting . However , while it was a fun movie , it wasn't the greatest blockbuster of the year .|0
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. Park's newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes, that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean, and uniquely Park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop.|1
This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.The basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema.|1
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a film. The acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried.|1

Funny Farmhouse Stories. You might remember I was in the middle of one of the strangest things I ever wrote ever. I'm not quite sure why it was called ""Twice as Weird."" It was actually a blog post that was posted to a blog called the Farm House Journal and it's a series of funny stories that were submitted by other bloggers to me. I was actually quite surprised at the outcome."|0
Well , after seeing `` Beginning '' I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor version. I can understand them changing it because it didn't sell very well, but this version was a bit boring and slow. That's probably why it was so boring. When I first saw it, I thought that it was a nice piece of art and I like the way that it was animated. After you saw the movie for yourself, it just seemed that it wasn't the same thing as the TV series, and it didn't help that it didn't really have a strong storyline.|0
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour -- she 's one of the dancing girls in DANCING WITH THE DEVIL. The woman is hot stuff! And she's good-looking too -- she's the perfect size -- but she has a hard time keeping the men away. In fact, some of them like her and want to take her dancing! But she's not about to let them do that -- she'd much rather make them stay in bed and wait for her to go to bed! And she certainly hasn't let the men fool her too much.|0
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. The movie opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed.|1
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. Then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV EVER -- I think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl.|1
"""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie. But if ""Lifeboat"" (wich unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time (the early 40's) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, not discovering this film isn't really a lost.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it's rather hard to find the Hitchcock's touch."|1
Overall , I give this film a decent 7.6 . To start I 'll say I love how the character of the mother/grandmother/aunt was shown in detail with her in her home , with her own thoughts , and even her voice. Her voice is so authentic you feel like you are right there. The acting is so believable , the story line is so good you just get sucked into the story , the characters have depth , and the visuals are beautiful. This movie is really something you do not see everyday , and it will be worth seeing.|0
Excerpt from TV GUIDE:This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra.This is typical, lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. The Captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor.|1
Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards.|1
There were many 'spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s , and although this has a strong plot, is not one of them. This story is not based on a western theme, but rather, a story about love, family and the struggle of being a good person. The movie was nominated for the Best Picture Award, and many awards for the cast members of the movie. The story starts when a young man goes to a bar , and his love interest and best friend is seen leaving, but he is the only person that sees her .|0
Since the past couple of days I 'm really hooked on the `` Female Scorpion '' series and I keep trying to finish them all. The first two books I 've read, The Scorpion King and The Reign of the Scorpion are fantastic. The next three books are just on the edge of my bed, waiting for their time in the sun. The latest book for me is The Death of Scorpion which I would consider to be the fifth book in the series. Here are the three reviews for Scorpion I 've read so far (so far I have read and reviewed them).|0
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs . It is definitely an awful example of a good idea, and even more so in an age of 3D, where you can actually play the game using an XBox 360 with Kinect as the controller. In my experience, using Kinect to play games was a lot more fun, but as with anything new, there were some issues. First of all, there are a few different types of games you can play and you have to play them the right way, in the right order, to get the most out of the system.|0
If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial slowness you’re in good company. For the past several years, American filmmaker Ryan Reynolds has been at the forefront of the conversation around Hollywood’s increasingly regressive attitude towards sex and sexuality. With films like I Don’t Feel at All and I Feel Pretty, which have been criticized for their homophobic undertones, and his hit rom-com Switched at Birth, which has been criticized for perpetuating an outdated notion of what a marriage should look like.|0
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well. Compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. The plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which I cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture.|1
I 'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival . It is a shallow film , but not a dull one , at least with a lot of imagination . It could have been worse , and in a way , I would say it is a masterpiece . The film is set in Europe during the French Revolution , and there is some humor in it . However , as you can see , it is a historical movie , and that is what I think makes it such a masterpiece . For those who haven ' t seen the film , it takes place during the French Revolution .|0
The story line of a man 's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the first day of school begins to unravel and it's time for some truth, but will he find it within the truth? The truth has to come out in order to save the innocent child but if truth is truth and love is love and he loves this baby with a passion he will do whatever it takes to make this child his. This was my first YA fantasy. I'm really enjoying the read so far and I think I've seen the author improve with every story.|0
Why would anyone make a film like this? Why would anybody invest in a film like this? Why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? Why would any theatre show a film like this? Why would any TV channel program a film like this? Why would any critic bother to review a film like this? Why would anybody watch a film like this? Why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. This is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible.|1
Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization.|1
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.|1
I just watched this movie last night . Within 30 minutes of the start , I was hoping it would end the way it starts . Unfortunately , I found myself wishing it would end at least a little differently . And it didn't , but the movie was entertaining and enjoyable . If you've not seen it , it will probably leave you with one thought about it after you've watched it . What does it mean ? This movie was made for the film festival in Cannes this year , so it's not a huge release yet .|0
Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier. It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime, and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian.|1
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... with a $100,000,000 budget. Director Steven Spielberg was supposed to have been the star of Steven Spielberg Presents, the story of an escape from a small New York town held hostage by terrorists. (Spielberg’s last movie, Lincoln, was a historical drama set in the 17th century, with Lincoln played by Daniel Day-Lewis.) But this movie, now in theaters, was not nearly as exciting as it could have been. And that’s saying a lot.|0
I 'm a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 's subgenres . Name one  I 've been looking . The director has been working on a project that he describes as The Black Friday of horrors,  an adaptation of Clive Barker 's story about a young man who finds a young child and takes it home. I ve never been able to decide whether to be scared out of my wits by the film or to laugh out loud. I will say that it is fun and creepy as well as being genuinely scary, and that is probably enough for me to recommend it.|0
"Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the ""Toymaker's"" family. And, that's about it."|1
As I write this in November 2005 I 've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end. The first signs of this appeared with the death of Richard Attenborough in February 2005. Although he was widely regarded to have had the finest voice of all the directors who've ever worked in Hollywood and certainly had some of the finest cinematic experiences to his credit, there's no doubt in my mind that his body had finally given out. He suffered a stroke in 1994 and died of the consequences in January 1995.|0
"On the positive, I'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called ""buzz"", and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would've been amazing."|1
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending. (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along.|1
I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general ( I 'm not sure why -- I just like prison movies. ) and this was the best prison movie I had seen yet. There was a lot of tension building in this movie that I enjoyed. There is a lot of violence too which I didn't mind ( except for the prison guards -- I didn't really care that much about that stuff ) and even the sex scenes, while not necessarily erotic, were well thought-out and a lot of fun. I also enjoyed the dialog.|0
Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film.|1
Spoiler with plot explanation: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy (that pops out from nowhere, and no questions asked... ) that went wacko, and Casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death. With every frame movie gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending seams completely dumb, it has nothing to od with the movie itself, i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s**t this way or other, so it may as well have a stupid ending.|1
"SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yep, that'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of ""Lord of the Rings"", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now, with ""Everything Is Illuminated"" he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character."|1
"Even if you're not a ""theatre person,"" I highly recommend that you see this. Based off of a play of the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing-- by far Sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna."|1

Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks?I mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. Med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. Bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies.|1
I went to this film full of hope . With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Michael J. Pollard, the script, direction, camerawork, casting and music were all excellent. I was not disappointed by the ending. I can’t remember if I’ve seen it before but it’s been well reviewed and I would definitely recommend. I went to see this movie and the trailer looked so much fun! I didn't expect much but figured I would probably enjoy it. Well I had a great time, I've never experienced such a great film!|0
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through . It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Mary Anne Fitzpatrick. A woman in her 50’s who is very close-knit and loyal. A woman who is able to bring love back to someone who has been abandoned by his own mother. Mary’s story is a tale of two women in love . A woman who never had a father to support her . She always knew she would never marry and raise children due to her past . A woman who’s life was thrown into chaos when she lost her daughter.|0
This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... I am in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius-. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to come by.|1
Before I start to tear apart this movie , mark you -- I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL . That story is one of the best things I ever read in a book, but it's also a story that can be told in any number of ways. What sets it apart from all other stories is its ability to be told in an extremely intimate way -- not so much to show us the horrors of a particular day, but to make us feel the agony of those days. This is how I'll tell this story.|0
An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him.|1
My mom and I, rented this movie. I mean, we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they be big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks.But oh, we were fooled!! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small city in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. My mom and I believe in god and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. All I really have to say, is that we are Christian, but even we like to have fun.|1
"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" could bring me back, so here I am.With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad."|1
"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me , but I think I have an idea : one of my friends (I know nothing about security) sent me the link and I read a little bit more into it. I’m really not sure how this will help the situation, but I’ve started using it, so I want to say what I’ve learned about it. This is not an attack of the network

If you are under attack, the first thing you will see is that the site is slow."|0
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
Why ca n't a movie be rated a zero ? Or even a negative number ? Some movies such as “Trainspotting” have been given a zero rating and yet they are very successful at the box office. Couldn't something like this be possible in India ? Maybe we can create a “zero rating system” in India to give more value to an item which might have a lower quality than the rest of the world. The problem is that it will be hard for the movie-lovers at home to accept the rating a zero has on a movie.|0
I 'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR ! ! ! I did buy this film for a dollar and I think the film is great and worth $ 1.00 but for a dollar , it is only worth one dollar. I can't get it out of my brain and I feel that it was a very good movie for only a dollar. I think it's a movie made for kids, because if you want something like this then you have to be like 13 years old. Don't pay more than one dollar to see a kids movie and that's it.|0
I was just lucky I found this movie . I 've been taking advantage of Walmart 's $ 5.50 DVDs for a couple of months , and I had never seen it till I saw this movie. I was very disappointed that it was on the dvd and that the picture quality was lousy, but I took a risk and rented the movie. This review is based on my own personal experience of watching it. This is a great movie for the family and should be viewed by everyone as a good wholesome family entertainment flick. I hope this review will be helpful in your decision to purchase or rent the DVD.|0
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb 's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (but not exclusively) ignored in recent decades, and which makes for a fascinating contrast to the prevailing view of him as an anti-Semite, or at least of him as the sort of man who didn't like Jews very much, or at least who liked Jews enough to try to have a sexual relationship with them in a way that he didn't like their religion, but whose religion didn't like Jews either.|0
I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up.It's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. They may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't.|1
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent.There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier.I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use.|1
When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year.|1
Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.As per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that's gotta count for something!|1
"[ CONTAINS SPOILERS ! ! ! ] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut . They basically had no money and were living off food stamps . Garfield had to leave his family to go and get some money to get a house so he could help his dad . When Garfield finally gets his money from his dad, his mom tells him he needs to get rid of Garfield because if he were to die, his family would starve. Garfield agrees. That night, Garfield walks into his mom's bed. He says to her ""Mom, I've had it."|0
"The recent documentary `` The Adventures of Errol Flynn '' is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero . It follows the exploits of this legendary actor in his many films, from '' Gold Rush '' to `` Gone With the Wind '' to `` The Charge Of The Light Brigade '' to `` Lassie '' to `` Ben-Hur . "" It was on the screen in 1956, with a cast of all the greats, including Errol Flynn, James Stewart, Barbara Bel Geddes, Lee Marvin, Joan Fontaine, Jack Carson, Henry Fonda, Walter Pidgeon, James Arness, James Whitmore and others."|0
In my opinion the directing, editing, lighting, and acting(minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. I wasn't expecting much, in way of camera angles, sound, etc, but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all.After seeing the film, I personally felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another. And I felt like the Travis(Franco) character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after Terri commits suicide.|1
This movie was extremely disappointing , I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy ' but do n't be mislead by the fact that that's not what it really is. It does look like something I could watch at a party , with the exception of a couple of 'gripped' out characters . It is the story of four friends that smoke weed and drink beer together. When one of them loses an important job , they get to live in a camper van with his best friend ( who is also a very good looking guy). The story follows the four of them through the years.|0
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don't! This is no Disney film. This film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. The video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'.|1
Police Squad ! ( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon . But I guess it had it's good moments . I thought the music in that series was good . It was very clean , and the music and the show had just a nice balance . It was just that it ended after a few episodes . I guess I am going to need more time with it . I think they should have been on for at least 6 . They were good . And the actors were alright . Maybe I am missing something .|0
That 's how I was when I walked ( staggered ) out of this `` film '' . I could not make a coherent statement because I had just seen something which, even at the moment of its realization, I felt no more than a few hours before. In the interval, as I walked about the streets I could have been in any European capital. Now I am sitting alone in my room, and it has all come out. And yet it is too late. I know it is too late. It is too late now.|0
I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Take about stage presence! There seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away.|1
There is something that one of the characters ( the aging film director who pretends to be dead ) says that I think will be very, very memorable. It is not the part that goes like this. It is the part that goes like that. He is talking to his young son who, as his mother has left him for some years now, is staying in the house. The director is in his late 70's now and he has lost so much weight that his son, not being able to recognize him, runs to find him and find him he runs to see his mother again.|0
"The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in a bundle of cash off it. Not that we are complaining about their efforts. “You’ve never seen two people so good for each other.”

That’s what I told Jane. And I think we all have the same opinion of her. She’s the best thing that ever happened to us, and she’s our friend, which is something that no-one would expect to see. Jane Turner is one of those people who will always be with you."|0
Finally! Other people who have actually seen this show! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. It is just hilarious. 'And so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' And some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience.|1
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks , this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. The acting is pretty poor. The editing is really bad. And the cinematography is boring to say the least. I have to admit that I have never seen this movie. Never watched it in my life. I saw some clips of it and I just couldn't get into it. It was really bad. The actors just didn't do the characters and it made them boring, but it also made them look like they were acting their ass off.|0
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me . Everything I hate about films is shown here and it only gets better . I am sure if the director has read this , they know they have made a film that makes me want to punch a wall in frustration. I don't believe the film has any intention of offending or making us laugh , it's a very sad attempt at humour. I can only see this film as a product of its maker's need to feel important and I really can't get past it .|0
The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript that is now lost. Many historians disagree on whether it is a real manuscript, and if it was real, what it actually says, and whether it is a true document or simply a fabricated story. The debate centers on how authentic the story is, how much of the tale has become legend, and whether the document is in fact a historical record of a massacre in which over a dozen slave owners lost their lives as their slaves were butchered in their own residences.|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers, Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town.|1
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel ? Well, I'm in a minority. The problem with a 1-hour special about a super-villain who's been locked away for years on a planet he's never set foot in before is that it's got to be more than just a plot device to get us to the conclusion we've always been waiting for. The movie doesn't do much for the audience beyond what they're expecting and what they can take in with one ear and out the other.|0
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?|1
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die.|1
"""The next Karate Kid"" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and charming and I cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie."|1
This appears to be two movies spliced into one . In the first , ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a time machine trying to escape from an evil man-eating woman. He has to fight to get out of Hell. In the second movie , he has to save the woman in order to get out of hell. It's good that he's a time traveler from another world. That's an interesting twist. It's not explained why he's trying to escape in the first place. He doesn't know why, so he's not trying to understand it.|0
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture , I know this was a fantasy film and it was produced by Bollywood . If you watch the original movie , you will never forget it . You can watch it on YouTube . You can see the movie on DVD . Or you can see it in the theatre . After studying about ninja culture , I thought the movie will be interesting because I love Asian movies . This movie is a fantasy film based on the legend of ninja warrior.|0
What on earth happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. Every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, I might add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in.|1
Created by Dennis Spooner , 'Department S ' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol , based on the novels of the French journalist and author, René Weisbecker. The drama was broadcast live on BBC 1 with the first broadcast on 26th October 1982 from BBC Broadcasting House, London, with a repeat on 3rd November 1982. The programme was produced by Dennis Spooner and directed and written by Simon Nye. It was presented in the UK by Michael Aldridge and Richard O'Sullivan in series 1 and 2 respectively, until the programme was discontinued in 1985.|0
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film . The script is full of holes from a script standpoint and I can't help but to be reminded of the old days of the 80's when people thought that they could just throw a camera on a couple of actors at the end of a scene with little to no real thought. The result was that most of the shots were taken with little time for editing and in my view this film is full of very poor acting and the script is a joke.|0
Having watched this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for Goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. While I do understand that Mr. Forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, I was left feeling that there was just so much of Goya left out, so much of his humanity.|1
Without John Rhys-Davies , I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter . But in the case of “The Invisible War ,” it was a movie that I was glad didn’t make it to the big screen . The director and screenwriter Robert Redford and writer Joe Cornish both wanted to tell a more serious story than “All the President’s Men ,” so they took it out to a remote location that had been set aside for such things . The result was an intimate story told with great sensitivity and a great deal of compassion and understanding for the Vietnamese people .|0
"OK , so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door . I open the door and I see my mom . Mom : I wanna talk to you please . Me : No, not now !

This is the second movie about 1985 , the other one was 'The Wedding Singer ' . Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was set in present day , the story is about a singer , who has the ability to sing on an instrument made to look like a harpsichord by the Nazis, he has to hide the talent to stay alive, but he has to do it in order to rescue his lover , who was kidnapped by the Nazis who wanted her as an organiser of death camps . The story is based on true events and there are some factual errors , but its true story .|0
Saw this at the video store and thought I 'd give it a try . Sounded like a good story and the acting was well done. The story was about a young man who fell into the dark side. He thought the only way he could be saved was to turn his life around to a better future. I think it is a pretty good story about redemption. The acting was OK but the story is well done. I would give it a try if I had the cash for it. You should rent it if you have the time and money to try something new.|0
"For me , reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film -- and of horror cinema , in particular. So, if you're a fan of either genre , you'll love this blog.

Here's a new film that I think is well made. I don't know if I'd call it a horror movie, but I do like it a lot."|0
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.|1
"Look, this film is terrible... the ""plot"" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. Eventually the kids engineer ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny."|1
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 1930s. She plays a young woman who finds a man she thinks is her father in a hotel room, tries to get him to take her away from her husband, and has to make her way alone across the country after he takes her to the woods. “It’s a small movie with a lot of emotional power,” Delpy told HuffPost. “This is not the movie you want to watch twice, but you’ve seen it 20 times.|0
to make this short and sweet : i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the film genre . the film was so bad , , , , , , i can't even count the negative points in the film . . . i don't know how i can watch this film at all . and i'm not the only that felt that way , i am sure it's going to be an even more controversial topic when the next generation of films will come . . the cast was so bad , , , , , , it was just a nightmare .|0
Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and judging from the enthusiastic response, he has much to be pleased about. A taught, well done Indy, impressive for it's big budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were were especially well cast in the leads, delivering strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film.|1
"... and in this series , I 've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle . Remember when I'd get so mad when you didn't kiss me the first time I saw you in my dream . . ."" It was almost as if I could actually hear him talking as he walked through the door . . . There he was, right in the open . . . I could see him right away. . . . He had on a gray shirt with dark blue jeans, and . . . oh, the way he moved!"|0
"A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth . He owns a nightclub where she dances . She 's a great dancer and a great dancer has a great style . It's a shame the film was a flop but you have to give credit to Rita Hayworth who played her as an elegant lady with the grace of a ballerina. Friday, March 28, 2012

In my review I wrote:

So many movies have been ruined by bad casting. This film, though, is not like most others. While the casting was poor, there are not too many flaws to point at."|0
Just a few words : it 's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he wasn't, he would have been in the ground a lot longer than he actually did. And, of course, that brings us to that other thing : the reason he isn't there anymore. This is what happened to him. You don't need to be in his movies (he had a lot of them, but I'll focus on the best ones), but there have to be a few scenes in his movies that don't work, and they are in this video.|0
"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the 1930s.Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate."|1
Dear Readers , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best ... although I really ca n't say what his best was as far as I know. What I will say was that he was a genius at what he did. The story of his life was indeed extraordinary. In one sense he was just an extremely gifted young man who found out he had a creative gift in film. The rest was a series of accidents and twists of fate. That is a story we can all appreciate. The film has an incredible cast of great actors who did great work on their own.|0
I must say : out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out . It has its share of moments of entertainment and it has its share of flaws as well . The movie has a very good story to tell about life of an ex-policeman trying to live his life back in Korea . But with this story it tries to do a complete 180 turn with its characters . I don't think that the movie gives a complete justice to its story . I'm not sure that we will get the complete justice in life . So I'll give it a 3/5 .|0
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie . I do n't like the baby and I do n't like the mother and I do n't much like the father. I would like the baby and the mother to stay together as they seem to be friends. This would make a good horror movie . It could have been a fun film . I just hope the child dies . I could not be more upset about this . I feel the child should have stayed . If the child dies it is better than if the child lives . I just hope they get back together .|0
I 've seen some Bible-based trash . This one tops it all . To make matters worse , it lasts almost 3 months . If you want to get to know something about religion , I would suggest you start with a non-fiction book . It will provide you with more information . Why are there so many religions? The answer lies in the human mind . We are all different in our views . But there are some common beliefs we hold and they are the basis of all religions . But there are also those who are atheists or agnostics .|0
`` The Racketeer '' stars Carol ( deprived of the `` e '' that usually appeared at the end of her first names). It also gives her her ``e`` in her middle name. *    The movie version of the musical The Rink to the Roof uses the character's full first name in a few dialogue scenes. The full name is given, though, in full in the book, and at the beginning of Act I, and in the opening scene of Act II. (See Chapter 9 for the book. )|0
"Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as ""a gherkin in a burger"". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die."|1
The movie is nothing extraordinary . As a matter of fact , it is an insult to the horror genre. There is not an ounce of suspense in it . As far as horror goes , this movie is just boring . The characters are dull and unexciting . The story line is so generic . The film is devoid of any real scares . This is a film with no soul . I'm going to be very blunt here. It's just boring. The film is nothing special - it's average, boring, and nothing to write home about.|0
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. The characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.About an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh ""oh, that is really stupid."""|1
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots. (In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).Mani's class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever... Maddy,who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too.|1
"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve."|1
"If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Don't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I am a big fan of films like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of B-Cinema.But this film actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academy award winner!! The Dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. ""I will now Condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. The acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.The story?"|1
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV . It was both entertaining and informative . The reason it is one of my favorite shows because it's so hard to review but you have to because of how much of a good thing it is. Keep it up and thanks for the great effort you put into writing this. It was an enjoyable series, but for me it fell flat after the first season, so I don't hold any brief for this show. But it's good to have a variety of shows on cable so it's a good way to pick up new ideas.|0
"I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece ""The Deerhunter."" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business."|1
Now out of all the shark movies I 've seen , this one takes the cake ! The plot of this one is simple and interesting with some nice twists that keeps us on the edge of the seat from beginning to end. The movie is based around a love story between a guy (Kurt Russell ) and his girl (Kate Winslet ) . The story begins when they meet and fall in love one night in the city , and then they begin their adventure in the ocean of their own free will. At the end of the road , they end up getting together , and finally getting married .|0
"I'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. The series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It is sad that a lot of the ""usual"" characters died but, damn, we had a lot of nice NEW characters.Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series, the plot."|1
I agree with all the comments posted so far : This movie was a waste of time and energy , but not because it was ill-conceived but because of the direction of the movie. So i guess we have two different opinions to share here... I also have problems with this movie. I think a majority of people would like this movie. I loved the concept, the script, the music and everything else. However, the direction ruined the whole thing and I don't think it could have done much of anything if they hadn't decided to take the movie to the next level.|0
I was expecting a lot from this movie , and I can say I have n't been disappointed . First off , this is one that is not for children , and certainly for those who are sensitive . This is not meant to be educational in any way , and I really don't blame the director for making this a movie for the adults , as it is not an educational movie , but more a movie about the lives of people who are very close to me . The story is about two brothers who grew up as close friends but are separated after their father dies .|0
I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work . It only took a couple of scenes to make me wonder whether this was even going to go anywhere. I had a couple of small issues that made me wonder if it was even going anywhere. Then, in the next two or three scenes, the characters really started to get involved, but the script just couldn't handle that level of depth or emotion. There was an issue in the first act that was so bad that I thought the characters might actually die.|0
"The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (see Figure 1.1). 1.1 Ghilli-danda

Gilli-danda is played by placing small pieces of wood on a tray, each one touching another one on a tray. When the pieces of wood touch in certain way, the player calls out the word ""Ghilli""! **Figure 1.1** A gilli-danda (left) is used in a ghilli danda. A gilli danda or gillidanda can be carved from any of various types of wood and is not limited to the traditional birch wood."|0
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he's to quit touring and the other Boys calls him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group.|1
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to see it again for the first time. At one stage I saw this movie for the first time ever and was very confused as to what it was I thought I was watching. That said, if you’re familiar with the book you’ll know what to expect but it is a good film nonetheless. The book was written in 1959 by the late author J.D. Salinger and you can watch the movie adaptation below.|0
"I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . . . too bad the show ended before it was over . . . I had a really interesting show on Tuesday, February 26th . . . I started off my show with ""A Night In Hell,"" which was actually a great introduction. I really liked it. The band really sounded like it was right before I saw them, and it was so cool that it was right before their ""Ain't It Cool"" tour (which is one of my favorite bands, period)."|0
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! What possessed the filmmakers to do this? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! Do not see this film. And have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue.|1
I saw this movie yesterday , and like most allrdy wrote `` i also expected a Steven movie '' , and i must say i loved the film . i think i am not alone in this , since most critics have said the same thing . but i just want to know what you thought , what do you think , Steven , how did you like this movie ? . this movie is absolutely worth a watch , i think it is one of the better ones . i think that is what i said the most , i really liked it , and you just need to watch it , its worth your time .|0
"i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me , and i could n't put it down until the end. it was one of the best movies i saw in last few days , the ending was so awesome , i didn't have any expectations , but it still made my day

I've been a fan of this author since reading ""The Last Unicorn"" and have loved reading this trilogy since then. Now, with the movie adaptation of the first book I'm hooked to the world. I'll be sure to read everything he writes!"|0
There were only two redeeming features about this movie ; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture , and the beauty of this movie. Unfortunately, the story of Bucharest’s history, which was well researched and written, was marred by factual errors, and a lack of historical information that would have brought more to life this wonderful story. A movie about the life and times of Ghenadie Matei , Romanian revolutionary, would have been more entertaining than this movie. It has been a long time since I saw this movie when I was younger, and I haven’t seen this movie for years.|0
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada -- particularly in Quebec . That 's because I see it as a story about a father and son trying to escape the consequences of a crime committed against them. In fact, a crime committed against many. But there are other factors that play into this movie, like the story of two sisters who are murdered by their uncle, whom they believe to be innocent, while the police believe he was guilty and are on his trail. And there is the question of who is right in a story of a father and son?|0
For a teenager who has never read Austen , this adaptation might be fine . But only for them . For others this film is the first step towards a possible future . I'm afraid there's nothing to take for granted here . I don't think this film can be taken as a recommendation . I think it'll be viewed with some suspicion . This film is just a great adaptation . A great start , if not quite the best . And it has all the best moments from Emma without all the problems . The story is so much more complex .|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by Bodrov Sr.'s hackneyed and confusing script, which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. Most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited.|1
For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result  Petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).Overall, The Mad Monster is one dull and poorly made Poverty Row thriller.|1
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to die before I 'm done with my movie . I loved the twists and turns the movie had to go through . I liked the twists and turns the movie had to go through . If I had it my way it would have had more twists and turns and I would have liked to see more of it . I thought that was a great way of writing the story . I liked the way it had the mystery wrapped up within it .|0
"This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects . Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing out a few words in the air are so lame and stupid that it is almost funny

The dialogue was so stupid that we were laughing aloud at the same time. There was almost nothing else on the film. It could have used more effects to give a better sense of atmosphere, more special effects to really bring it to life and more characters to bring it alive. Maybe the script was so stupid that no one really thought about it."|0
"Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, ""Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian"" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. Not well done."|1
"this is horrible film. it is past dumb. first, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in 7th grade. not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being pretty and popular is not everything. but that is what the twins make it out to be. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to France. He has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two ""cute french boys"" with motorcycles."|1
I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. The film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. The acting was absolutely dreadful. The children were overly whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept from peace. The monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. The drama is laugh-worthy. I cannot remember when I saw a more dreadful film.|1
I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career , but `` The Man with the Golden Helmet'' is by far his finest film to date. In addition to being great fun, and being one of the first big budget films to be shot with practical 3-D, it's also an important movie for several reasons. Not only because it's the only film of the three to have a full cast of female stars (Judy Garland in the lead), it's also because of the subject matter.|0
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch. With such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. The excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. The photography in Empire Falls was lovely.|1
This movie was boring . Very much like Underworld , only even less interesting . It 's not much of a movie , although it 's not all bad , just not very original or creative . And there are a lot of bad parts . I agree. I watched this movie as a joke but it was really awful and boring! I enjoyed it more after I read about it. That's the first time I've ever read this type of reviews, because the ones before were very negative and bad, even if it's from a critic.|0
At the beginning of the movie , Ramgopal Verma says that `` Sarkar '' is his tribute to The Godfather , a movie that has come to define cinema in 20 years. The Godfather is an excellent movie , but it doesn't come close to the genius of Sarkar. In fact, that's one of the many reasons why we love the movie . Verma, the great man who is also a director, says that Sarkar is his tribute to The Godfather , the movie that came out in the 90s. I like to think that the Godfather and Sarkar are two different movies .|0
"The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It's the story of a young retarded person, called ""Zep"" (sic). A night, he sees his sister's SM sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! Zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. One man will find them. One man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist."|1
"This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring ""looks-like-a-suspens"" scenes.Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of ""hello's"" and few ""hang on"" on the 1st part.Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters."|1
1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 ( Dir-Brad Sykes ) : Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much had it's heart in its mouth from the moment it opened its mouth. The first 15 minutes or so made it seem at least like something that might have been good and interesting, if just a little longer. It went downhill from there. It was pretty bad. Very, very bad. The characters seemed bland and stupid. The dialogue was often bad. The acting and direction were also poor. There seemed to be too much of it going on.|0
"Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. Absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help cringe when I recall some of his lines, like ""In or out? You're worse than a cat!"""|1
This is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies I've seen for awhile. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks from Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the Chupacabra of legend is much smaller. All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. Why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the Chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do OK??|1
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they 're life styles and pasts which support this.The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors' seamless acting teamed with Bechard's Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story.|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff , but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself or your opinion above a group that doesn't agree with your opinion. I don't think I've ever read anything that made me laugh that wasn't funny on its own, even if it doesn't necessarily have any positive or negative intent on the part of the writer, so I can only assume that what you wrote in this piece would be funny to most people. I think you need to take a look for yourself, and decide if you want to write about things you don't really believe.|0
Being a fan of the series I thought , how bad can the movie be ? Well I got my answer after seeing “The Dark Knight” and now it’s time to see what they did with the other movie . I have seen both movies and both movies did not live up to the hype . So what did the directors do that was so bad ? For one , the acting was horrible , the plot was way to stupid, and the special effects just sucked . Even worse , the story of “Catman” was written in such a weird way that it made no sense .|0
This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet.Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and riveting. His displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow, love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or over-the-top. In fact, some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression.|1
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced, frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. I'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King.|1
"This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself ""this is going to be really good"". However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. The problem, not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner."|1
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many but I'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say I like 'em, especially Guts of a Beauty (aka Entrails of a Beautiful Woman). Watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and I was surprised how well it actually went over.Entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of Asia (specifically Japan in this case).|1
"I can't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex--at least I think that's what it was about. The script made no sense at all, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera-work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to ""support African American films."""|1
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't.|1
Now, I love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. Surely no one actually WROTE dialogue this pointless.|1
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a lot of flack, but it actually got great reviews! It was funny, and I enjoyed it a great deal. My only complaint was that I felt it had been edited very, very well, and a lot of the humour came out in the edit. But that’s a minor complaint compared to how awesome it was before the film was cut. First of all, thank you so much for all of your lovely comments here on my blog.|0
I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse.|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after this, rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You'll see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.|1
In short this movie was awful.I understand it 's a Disney movie , which are generally shallow movies with mediocre script and acting but this one was so bad I don't know if Disney could have pulled it off. I watched it with my Mom, and my dad. The movie starts with a prologue showing how the main characters live in a village in a fictional version of India, with the protagonist's family. I think they live somewhere in India. Anyway, the movie centers around a young boy, Ravi.|0
One of the movies i just DIDN'T want to see. I got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.Also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.|1
OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games aren't what I would brag on if I was over the age of 15. Cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. Just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't loose my girlfriend in that. Grease being the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical.|1
* * * SPOILERS * * * This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the most intense and violent zombie flick you will see this year. * * * If you don't want to know what happens then stop reading this review and go away. I'd like to be the last person in the room to tell someone about this film. Just trust me on this one. And you might want to go back and watch some of the other films on my Top 20 lists, before deciding to read this review.|0
This is my first Deepa Mehta film . I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its English subtitles. The film was released in 2006 but was not shown in India. The film was shot on a large area in Mumbai, India and has a very good storyline with a few good twists. The film has a lot of dialogues and good action scenes. The film has a good story and is very good on the screen. The film is set in Mumbai in the year 2025, after the 2008 financial crash .|0
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a girl from New Jersey who travels to New York and becomes one of the “wild girls” living in the grungy underbelly of Manhattan. When she arrives in New York and is forced to make a name for herself as she fights to prove she’s not only “wild” but also “cool”, Portman plays against Sarandon’s more confident and confident. It’s a story of both women at the start of their careers but in many ways it also feels like a coming-of-age tale.|0
I 'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with , but how did this seem to be the end of the world when I had no way of knowing this would happen. Well... now I am here. I don't know what to say other than.... I'm not sure if I'm in shock or just a tad disappointed. The idea that we would go from the biggest team in the NBA to the worst in the Western Conference seemed impossible. That was until we started winning games and started making it seem like everything was going our way.|0
"It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he is a really good guy. Of course it will be interesting to see who gets the role of Bruce Willis next time he is in a movie. He should be able to step up and take the lead role again. I'm just wondering if he really wants it. ""When I die, my death will be celebrated as I deserve to be: with laughter, music and, most of all, a lot of pain."""|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life.|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). Young Billy, Elizabeth, and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. But they can't go on fooling everyone.|1
"Well, after seeing ""Beginning"" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing ""Dominion"" I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better.Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. But there is so much little of it in the movie."|1
I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech.|1
The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable . It was just one of those things where I thought I watched the same movie three or four times or something and I just had to give it another try . I have no idea of the story going on in this movie . There were just a few things going on and that's the problem . The acting and the writing weren't there . They were just a little bit there and the rest of the movie was just there . I couldn't care less what happens .|0
I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook.|1
As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome?|1
Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain.|1
This is the worst movie of all-time , no doubt , and Schindler 's List , did in fact have the best acting performance of this list , and even that is a dubious honor at this point . not to put too fine a point on the movie , for me it doesn't work . but i do have to admit i'm not sure if i would have liked it as well as i do now , even though i've watched it several times over the last year . it is just too weird , too off the wall for me .|0
`` Son of the Mask '' is a terrible excuse of a movie . I went to see this with the express intent of going in to the cinema to watch it, but could never muster up the motivation. I mean, the story itself is interesting and it's really well made. But that's pretty much all you can expect from something like this, even if the writing is top notch. However, for a movie to be able to get to the top tier of any genre, at least one thing must be very good, and it's not the writing.|0
This movie was so poorly acted . What was with Jeff Bridges accent , horrible and unbelievable . Was it that Jeff Bridges got drunk on a plane ? . I don't think so . I hate the movie , the only thing I liked about it was the end , I have to say it was not the best ending in the history of the movies . Hmmm, here's a question that might help you sort it all out: Have you seen the movie in which Jeff Bridges plays a very, very bad version of himself?|0
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermellons, people, etc. This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to.The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV.What is Phase IV?|1
One of the commenter 's is wrong . This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he did n't direct. If you want more about Patterson , go back in time to his early work. He was always one to go to the dark side. I always wondered if he was born that way as his father had died early and he never talked about it. I am a big fan but I will always say that his best work was way back in the 60' s . I never saw a movie as bad as this and I never even heard of this.|0
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits.|1
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre . Vulnerable , naive nurse Charlotte Beale ( Katie Holmes ) is taken advantage of by the hospital's resident psychopath, Dr. Michael ( James Cromwell ), who is also her ex-convict lover . And yet Charlotte cannot forget his kindness to her as she attempts to recover from the trauma she suffered from the accident that took the life of her husband and child . This is not a work of art in the traditional sense , but is the first film in a new genre that takes place entirely inside of a hospital: medical reality TV .|0
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an X-File. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up.|1
i love watching the Jericho mile . i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt play basketball. i mean you can see he was the best but when u get to the level where u have to do it and you have to put all your heart into it then you know when its over, it was over. i think it is easy to see in this case how it is over. all he has to do now is try and make a comeback in a matter of months. im not saying he can but i am saying he will.|0
With its rerelease by ADV Films , I 've had a chance to watch `` The Giant Majin '' for the first time in some time. If you're not familiar, the film is about a Japanese man who goes to the South Pole with a robot to search for traces of an ancient civilization. He leaves a wife behind. He has no idea the robot would become his lifeline to civilization or that the woman would become his surrogate mother, the only person with his heart and soul. She survives the ordeal with him. It's a beautiful movie.|0
"I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive play, but now I can see that it's a great show. I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw and felt in San Francisco during the summer. I was in SF for three days last week, and during one of my days I had a great lunch date with this woman. After we ate our sandwiches, we wandered around the Mission District, and I had a really nice time hanging out. Then she said:

'Are we going to find the Mission Theater?"|0
"I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual ""horror"" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the ""Exorcist ""movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty ""B-movies"" she did? David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to ""Knight Rider"" or ""Baywatch"".All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film."|1
"For once a sequel to ""The Karate Kid"" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process."|1
"I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever ! He gave us the awesome "" Lethal Weapon ."" He's always had a gift for making people feel and think about the right thing to say ! Here's to the future Shane Black ! May he flourish and be happy in this new journey he is going on ! And now here's the trailer. Enjoy ! And here's the poster of the new movie , The Wolverine . Enjoy ! If you've been looking for the perfect movie to get you in the mood to go out and have some fun !"|0
I can't express enough just how bad this film was. First of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well I guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. The script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. I imagine maybe if I saw this back when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst.|1
If you Listen to Ween ( The Pod , God/Satan ) , then you know what 's going on with Ween these days . It has been announced that in the month of February the band will go on their first North American tour (which will include stops in places like San Diego , Houston , New Orleans and many more ) . That will be the first time the band will tour in the U. S . . and the tour will feature Ween songs from the album ( which is expected to be released this month ) .|0
Visually , this film is interesting . Light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an interesting storyline . It has a good message in this film , which can make people understand the power of love . It is true that , in life , people make mistakes , and that's why one should accept it and get over with it . This is a good film , in fact I would call it a very well made film . However , the way in which the movie has been written and the story line in which the movie has been written are a little bit too complex .|0
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer.|1
In his feature film debut `Yellow,' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian-Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. However, in so doing, Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates Asian-Americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. The result? Dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch.Don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `Yellow'; each falls into one of two camps.|1
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).|1
The first few minutes of this movie do n't do it justice ! For me , its not funny until he is being shot !!!! The movie is good, it is a bit slow for my taste though, I don't know why ! The action scenes are not as good as i expected, I expected much better ! I like the fact that he is in a car. I think that it makes a better scene . The plot is okay, but I'm not 100% sure about it . I do like the story , its quite interesting .|0
When I first saw the trailer for this film , I really wanted to see it . I thought some people would like this because of its unique look . I thought it would be something to like. I really didnt know how it would turn out to be . After watching the trailer , I thought it would make a cool watch. This trailer gives you a lot of ideas about what you can expect in this film . For example . This trailer has alot of humor and humor makes this a good movie . The story line is very good and can be used to make a good movie.|0
The animal-eating ( geek ) scenes were not as bad as you would think . After having watched Mondo Cane for more that a few hours , they were not that bad . I have a small family but they do not like to watch a horror movie so when i saw that they could still enjoy the movie by themselves . I give this a 7 . I thought the movie was horrible . I have watched it 3 times now , it gets better each time it comes back on the dvd . The best movie i have seen in a long time .|0
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels , do n't expect anything deep and meaningful . If you 're looking for something very different from the typical adventure-film, you'll love Wild Rebels . You 'll experience the world of adventure as if you 'd never seen it before . Just as you 're looking for a movie to get you through your week-day schedule, you'll find yourself engrossed in the world of The Wild Rebels . The film will transport you from everyday life to an amazing world full of adventure and excitement. Wild Rebels is the type of movie you would have never imagined would come to life .|0
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina.This film came out when the Original Star Wars proved there was a market for Science Fiction. This in turn lead to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.)|1
There 's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me . You can watch the trailer after the jump . I can't tell you what it is, but something is happening here that no other filmmaker has ever attempted. And it's a big, big, big gamble on Shiban's part to take. So we're watching this film to find out more. As is often the case with X-Files movies, the story is built on a single premise - the abduction of a 15-year-old little girl by an alien father figure.|0
"This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old ""cons turn good"" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', although nowhere near as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is Ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in Terminator 4.The MOD Squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy."|1
"Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course ""no question about it"" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like ""extremely boring"" or ""nothing happened"" ""a complete waste of time"". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening."|1
no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the IMDB comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script IS terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace.|1
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen."|1
"There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn't actually started watching it.To begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out ""Look there!"""|1
Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age.|1
Homecoming ; what a HUGE disappointment ! ! After reading the plot summary ( the dead coming back to vote for their loved one ! ) the only way I am willing to go forward with the finale is if they don't play the dead as the only ones that vote for a loved one in the end ( so they are actually not coming back for their family member ! ) So let's assume that the story ends with that, what I want to know now is what happens in the finale, and the only way i can find out the answer is by watching the finale .|0
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic . Anyroad , here it is . Now , you all know that there’s no way this ever should have happened. Matamoros is no more dangerous than any other town in the US. It is a fairly small place with very few tourists and has not suffered any major disasters. So , why the panic ? We’ll start at the beginning. On the night of the accident Matamoros, Texas , was under the control of a small band of criminal gangsters who for years had been operating in the shadows.|0
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever . There is no spoken dialogue , no sound effects , no music , nothing . Just blood squirting in the eyes , nose and mouth . Then it is over with the camera just going straight out . There is no cutaways , no flashbacks , no anything . It is all straight up , no nonsense . And it is fucking amazing . In fact the first time I watched it I had to stop the tv and turn it back off . It is so intense and scary that I almost lost it myself .|0
***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. But then came the rest of the movie. By the time it was over I was furious. Nothing was correct but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden.|1
"Great subject matter , director , and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film , told in that manner , it may not be great , but the acting , the direction , and the set design and photography all combine to make it a film that has more of a ""mash-up"" feeling than a true stand out . the acting by both hanks and joel fredman is very good but i must admit , in comparison to what should have been an excellent cast , i feel like i'm watching a different movie ."|0
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what ?! There is corn on them. This has to be the best sport, and the best way to learn sport. There is a little competition that goes on between the teams when they get the field. You will be surprised to see how good the team with the freshest fields are compared to the older, tired teams. It is a lot of fun. Some people think that there is nothing to it, but it is actually very, very good.|0
I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film.|1
Wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life.|1
"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why -- I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of ""scared straight""! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me."|1
Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. The actor i liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.Plot is a little uneven, about Lt.|1

The story is about a psychic woman , Tory , who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic past . When she comes face to face with her ex, she finds that there is more to life than she was ever aware of. It is a tale of love, heartbreak, betrayal and second chances. It tells the tale of who you are, who you have to be and most importantly, who you have to leave behind at the end.

There are movies that are leaders , and movies that are followers . `` Meatballs '' was a leader . It was the one that everyone wanted to see, because of the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy , and for all the other reasons too. It's still one of the hottest movies at the box office, even if you don't like their chemistry. It is true that this movie has come to define the two actors, because of the chemistry that they had . It's still a good movie.|0
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...In this case, I guess it doesn't matter that much. The third Underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. They had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in.|1
Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. They aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No.Acting, corny and rubbish.Sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.Cinematography. These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix.|1
1931 also presented `` an American tragedy '' , the original tale of `` who will he take up with '' ? He was killed on July 6, 1940 by a German U-boat when trying to board an unarmed U-boat in the North Atlantic, according to an article on the `` World War Two Ship and Submarine '' website . An article on the `` World War Two Ship and Submarine '' website details a German submarine sank an American freighter in the Gulf of Mexico on June 5, 1919 and the U-boat was then captured by a U.S Navy destroyer which sank the German ship in the same location.|0
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry ' because this was 'like watching paint dry.' It could have just as easily been written off as an unfulfilled dream or a poorly-written script. It couldn't be denied that this movie was better than the average, but there was no real reason to take the film seriously. The only thing the filmmakers seemed to get right is that, despite it being their first feature-length project, they had a lot of experience in the world of film making and a lot of confidence in their project, so why not give it a shot?|0
"I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated college and moved on to ""real life"". I was not in a fraternity, but a lot of my best buddies were, and I got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house, so I know what goes on to some extent.This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or college life for that matter, although it does hold a lot of truth, albeit exaggerated for the most part."|1
"This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see ""Black Day, Blue Night."" There is the late, great J.T. Walsh (""Swing Blade,"" ""Pleasantville,"" ""Red Rock West,"" ""The Last Seduction,"" and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (See also ""Breakdown"")."|1
I'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog. The film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight some more. There brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship.|1
"Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda , Stanwyck , and the supporting cast.Never saw this film in a theater, but it does have a great cast. I don't understand why this movie was rated R. I thought it should have been rated NC, or at least PG. In the film ""The Graduate"" we see, in flashback, our young protagonist, Benjamin (played by Paul Giamatti), coming home late from a high school basketball game. He's very tired and he walks through his small apartment and to the door, which he has not used in ages."|0
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish . My aim is to help people who might not be able to come to watch a film if they are not very familiar with it . I try to find out a bit more about the film in a short blog post . I don't want this post to become too detailed . The reason is that this post will give you an idea of something I liked , and if possible I want to keep it very short . I don't have to be that specific about the film if the film itself is really good .|0
"First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never ""big"" here in the US as it is everywhere else.That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen.Now, I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over and this show stands out.The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was terrific."|1
this is one of the stupidest movies ever , not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest . i would have been able to sit through the movie in 1/2 if not 1/3 because it really did not hold my interest , nor was i able to give a shit about anything else . i thought i liked it but i guess i was wrong ! if you do not enjoy this movie i would recommend to not waste your time on this . if you are the type of movie lover that enjoys mindless popcorn watching you should not watch this .|0
I'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a $5 bin I figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea.|1
"The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."|1
Would be promising if it were a student film . Never seems to know where it 's going next , even as it leaves the one it 's on at the last second , and sometimes doesn't seem to want to leave that 's on . You have to wonder what's up with this. For one, I would think he'd want it to do well, and he would want the film to do well. I can see why he is so concerned with his film, as he is in the business of selling it.|0
And so it started with `` Shreik '' a send up of horror films , then we had Scary Movie, then Saw , and now we are seeing more and more horror remakes . what I want to do is take you back to 1977 and talk about the rise of the horror genre in Hollywood , the first two films that really kicked off the horror movie revival , and the horror genre itself . however , first let me say that there are many other horror films that came out back in 1977 that are well worthy of being remade .|0
I simply can not understand how any Who fan , or just plain anyone could find this awful , lazy, unimaginative, mediocre movie interesting. The movie does not tell an interesting story about an ancient evil that was responsible for the death of the ancient gods and the rise of humans . The movie is an epic tale of love , passion , lust , revenge, and murder. There is not much of a plot . The story is based on an ancient Greek epic and has been adapted numerous times over the centuries . The film was made in 1964 by Richard Fleischer who was nominated for an Oscar for this film .|0
"What a wonderful film , filled with eccentric , unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast led by Mark Ruffalo , Bill Murray , James Gandolfini and Christopher Meloni

As I have been thinking about this movie for awhile , I have been watching a lot of movies with characters similar to this group of eccentric , talented characters . It is a group of very talented people who can be a little difficult to pin down . I think it is great that this group of characters are a good match for the role that they were cast to perform ."|0
This movie could have had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course acting is needed. This film lacked both!First, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact.|1
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic.|1
Well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. Instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.|1
Would be promising if it were a student film. Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.|1
This film was really terrible.However , it 's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene in a long time! The story was interesting enough though , with the plot involving a family who are on the move to a new home. The story was good enough that I watched the entire film twice - first to see how the story progressed , and then a few days later when I needed a little boost in the emotional department! What I noticed during the re-watch was how the plot was a bit of a cop out.|0
What a mess -- and I 'm not referring to the `` destruction '' in the title . I could be wrong, but I'm sure I'm right. 1. The US and Israel are trying to start an arms race. 2. They have the same weapons, and they can't agree on how many warheads to put on the missiles. 3. We have the most advanced missile guidance system ever built. The problem is, we haven't agreed to share the data with each other, so each country only knows what it's own missiles are doing.|0
First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is most certainly a film worth one's while, but one is left sorely puzzled at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for whose beyond himself); or was the Colonel not a fraud, but used as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest Colonel?|1
DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, although way hotter than most low budget starlets, is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I ain't trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick.|1
"Went to the Preview Engagement of ""Grand Champion"" today (Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. Though the plot is a little ""Hokey"" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. Director/Author Barry Tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment."|1
"Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist? In this case, it is ""Jurassic Park"" and I don't even know what I'm going to say about it. For what it is, let's just say that I'll probably never see anything like this again (except maybe a movie like ""I Am Legend"", which is a pretty damn good horror movie). So I've decided to give my take on ""Jurassic Park""."|0
"A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of the manga, anime and other extras that came out. It included:



• All of the manga, except for a handful of chapters that are now available online



• English translations for all of the anime, including the English language editions of the anime series, the anime films, the manga, and the TV series. You can also find a lot of original artwork from the manga on there. I was really excited about this when I first saw it, since I really like all of these original artworks."|0
I saw `` Sweeney Todd '' on Broadway in 1980 . It starred George Hearn and featured most of the Broadway musicals. I was in the orchestra as well, so I thought it was an interesting musical. As a youngster, I thought it was a great story. My mom loved it. I think she would have been ashamed of me. Sweeney Todd may be one of the great musicals. A great story, and a very clever one. What makes me think it might be better than it is? It’s not the music, the dancing, the singing, or the storyline.|0
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions.|1
"Altioklar: Master of the thieves. Watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched ""Identity (2003)"", ""Saw (2004)"", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said ""Eureka, eureka""(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It took only 10 minutes for me."|1
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp setting. The series was dubbed “Battlestar Galactica” in North America and was first broadcast in the UK in the early 90s. I am surprised how much of it still stands up. I was surprised to find this series is available on Netflix in the UK. The series is available to stream and is well worth a watch. The story follows the ‘battlestar’ crew as they try to survive a space disaster after a ‘galactica’ sized asteroid collides with earth.|0
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has very much of.|1
I watched Love Life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting, but as whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words.|1
This can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. But I have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to be remembered.To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted.|1
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself... Am I going crazy..? Can't I see the beauty from a film like this..? Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did!|1
"Acting 10, Script 1. ""Hurlyburly"" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. Even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ""ain't."|1
Actually I 'm still in doubt if there 's anything about this movie I like . As for the story , I agree that this is a great movie . For a first one I think . I would have liked the second part of this movie , because it was a better one . I didn 't like this one very much , it was the only thing , where I did not like this movie . But still it was not bad . In the second part I 'm not so sure , if it was a different movie , I 'd go for it .|0
It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion.|1
...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance.|1
When I first saw this movie , I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset , but , it is not that bad , it is just an ok movie , I was bored , and I am not sure how it could get much better . The only thing that got me to like the movie as it started out was the fact that there was a man who was with his dead wife , and she was smiling . Then , we saw his daughter , and she did not give a hoot about him , not even at all .|0
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie . Instead , I saw a movie that was trying to take on the UFO phenomenon. For a movie that was supposed to come out on August 19, 2012 , it came out in a theater that was almost two years after it was actually scheduled to release. It is called “Glorious Nellie”. It has already been a success in Japan and will probably be successful in China. But the film is very controversial in the UFO community, and the only thing that could have caused this was that it was not planned to be released when it was released.|0
What crack are you smoking? This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! The action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, I just about peed myself. I could go on...Entertaining, arguably so. Good, no. Well made, certainly not.As a commentary on America as empire, it's actually pretty good.|1
"Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. Sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his card buddies. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family.Faith, family, and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune--""Return to Me."|1
the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience.|1
A stupid movie , with a stupid plot . Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender . It could have been made by a guy in his fifties , who just got tired with the same story . It is a shame , but , that this movie is as pointless and boring as hell . The plot was a joke , as it was just a rehash of what we have seen in the last years , or maybe decades . Not to mention , the plot twists are not that imaginative . But , it would be interesting , to think , why would anyone want to see such nonsense ?|0
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well.|1
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible. Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. Don't make the same mistake I did. The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can't pull it off. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines.|1
I 'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A . Not only do they sound as if they’re talking down to A, they’re actually doing it. I’m very glad that I’m not a big fan of Koyama Shohei himself. But I have to say that a lot of these reviewers who are praising A aren’t talking about the game, they’re praising it for some of the things Koyama Shohei has contributed to it. And I don’t really care.|0
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race.|1
"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great! ""The King Of Queens"" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves."|1
As a serious marathoner, I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. While I did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of Deena Kastor, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: These were brief!!|1
I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money ( and time ) I have ever wasted. It is like watching a video tape of your high school days with no sound. It is a real piece of junk. It has no soul. It makes me so angry to see a film like that made so many times over, for money. The script is weak and there is no chemistry between the leads. I would not rent the film if it were not for my nephew who loves the film so much.|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at a different stage of life.The movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you have seem them before. Yet I would not want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note.|1
Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them . Whilst shamelessly copying a song I would never have heard of myself. I've been going back and forth for a couple of weeks now - to try and decide whether to re-record it and re-release it as a single, or to keep it as the double A-side release it was when it originally came out. There is something about its simplicity that I really like - I never quite get used to it, even after hearing the songs a thousand times.|0
In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi (e.g. The Score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. This one apparently demands and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master.I was on the edge of my seat throughout. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of its day.I would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.I cannot give it enough stars.|1
As a fan of nearly any period drama, and at that a huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaption. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short. It felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtly to the relationships, particularly that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location. Despite having looked forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas I turned this off after an hour and went to bed.|1
Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.The acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (Magaret, Rain, Hal).The plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable.|1
i love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's Casey his sister to now where he's dating Dana.. love this show cant wait until Monday night!! Also i am so glad that cappie and Casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! As for Evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale.|1
We have a character named Evie . Evie just wants to be a good person . She 's nice , and has a heart of gold , but she's not always very happy . She's been bullied at school , because she's very shy . She's also got a good heart , but she's not as brave as some of the other kids . But she is determined to change . And I hope to do the best job I can. Evie is a character who appears in a novel, and in the film version of the novel.|0
"I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in ""robot"" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole ""plot"" isn't a robot either.The whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the acting...This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of ""Star Crystal""."|1
"Two little girls strike a friendship. One tries to convince the other she's a witch. The other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. On and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose ""shocking"" questions. You know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, ""How do you make a deal with the devil""? Oooh... creepy.In the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend."|1
A few yrs ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that Rozzie R. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'.Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading.|1
I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was no fun at all. I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way.|1
I love this show . I watched every episode last year . I bought the DVDs . And I tune in the next time I have a few minutes free after work at the gym . Every episode is awesome . The cast is awesome , the production team is awesome , the location is awesome . And every single episode has one of the greatest fights of the year . I'm sure I could have watched the whole series on my laptop and not missed a beat . But I always have a DVD or two . There's a very interesting aspect of this show that I'm just now realizing .|0
With a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it.|1
This movie , although well shot and superbly acted , was awful . I felt as if I was watching a movie made for someone like me ( a white male) , who is not particularly interested in the movies that I watched . What I loved the most about this film , aside from the brilliant casting , was how it dealt with an extremely sensitive and important issue in the society , yet presented it in such an honest and genuine manner . This movie had all the elements of a great love story . The chemistry between the three leads was excellent .|0
River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it a lot I am not sure it has a single bad or weak point. The first half or so seemed to drag a bit but I am not sure if I could have seen it a few days before as I am a bit slow in that regard. It is definitely not a perfect film in any aspect. I would rate it 7 out of 10 and I think it will be one of the better films I have seen this year.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor, but he is probably one of the finest screenwriters around today. The only reason we haven't seen Howell in anything is that his movies don't work. I'll get to that in a moment. It's hard to say how much of Howell's early success is because of his screen presence. But Howell has always been able to carry a screenplay to fruition, and few writers can match that feat.|0
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock, it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: ""He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour."" The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police. ""Strangers on a Train"" is probably one of the best in his ""wrongly-accused"" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series."|1
It starts quite good , but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are getting . The film starts slow . The first 3/4 hours or so are good , it's just after the fourth or fifth of these that things start going downhill . You know , it gets to a point where there is very little plot , but you get a good script from the director , but that is as far as it gets . There is nothing to the story that is original , it has been done too many times , and in this case it's a good story .|0
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. One of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor Peter Coyote lives in.|1
The Toxic Avenger , Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger ( John Altamura who played the Toxic Avenger ) killed a man in revenge for the man's brother, the guy who killed the brother tried to kill him in revenge, and then tried to shoot the Toxic Avenger after he killed the guy. He didn't make it through the first time. He was so traumatized by that that he couldn't return to work in the film, much less the studio. He did make it back to work on the second part.|0
YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous.|1
"This movie makes ""Glitter"" look like ""Schindler's List."" Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting a P.O.S. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer/director/producer/actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project gone south, ""Hell Ride"" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on Bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in."|1
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good. In my opinion it is a very good and a very bad. I was originally going to write a post about the trailer but I don't want to write that post now. Instead I decided to watch the trailer again and make my own judgment about it. So here is my review. I'm not going to go over everything in great detail, but there are a few parts that are important to my opinion of the movie.|0
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered to the four winds of heaven it is more acceptable to deny and diminish than to recognize and appreciate. In my younger years, I did not think much of the Catholic Church. My parents were not Catholic, and neither was I. But in the wake of my conversion, I discovered that, at heart, I am an evangelical Protestant. And I have remained so throughout my life. I love God and Jesus, and I believe that he loves me, and that he has chosen me.|0
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew, but there was something that didn't seem to resonate with those watching it, as if it was being viewed in a bubble. I feel that it could have been a movie that resonated more with viewers, and made a bigger statement, because of the subject matter and how the characters were introduced. Instead it came across to me like it was another movie, which is what made it more exciting, but maybe not that interesting or meaningful.|0
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite storyline. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies.|1
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is , in many ways , a modern equivalent of Dickens ' Hard Times, except that it's less melodramatic about it. At the time of Hard Times and the American Civil War , the North was a nation divided by class and slavery (not to mention the Civil War itself) so Dickens was able to use it to explore those themes, while at the same time making his audience feel that they, too, have been through a similar experience. And it worked! It made the American Civil War a more visceral experience for the audience.|0
When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book `` Het Gouden Ei '' /the Golden Age by the Dutch illustrator Piet de Vrije, he was in no doubt as to his task. ``We're going to use the same drawings,'' he says, ``but this time as illustrations.'' As a child in Holland, he says, ``I was always very attracted to drawing. So from the moment that it started to be possible for children to draw, I used to draw.''|0
"If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the bowels of made-for-TV hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused ""docu-action"" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W ""rawcore"" footage. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming."|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year, until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis , maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens.|1
I 'm a big fan of the demonic puppets . Looking at the surface of this one , it looks like it's meant to scare people (in a good way) and I'm really not sure that I'd want to have one in my house. That said it does look like it could be fun if you have a lot of imagination about what you can accomplish with it (and if you are up to the challenge). It also looks like it would probably work well as part of a display for Halloween party .|0
"I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled ""Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op."|1
Realistic Master-Piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I never saw in my whole life a film like this one. First time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction... And It didn't looked like... That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It's the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down.|1
Now , I love bad , old skifee movies as much as most people . And I understand that a lot of them make no sense when they're done , but there's one I love , and I know there's one more. It's a bad movie , in that there is not much that makes sense about it. There's one point in it where I can't even follow what the heck they're doing , but I think I get the basic idea. And when I saw it, I could totally see how it might have had some sort of meaning .|0
Personally , I do n't like a lot of b/w movies , but there 's something magical about this movie that I find it so fascinating , that i can 't believe it's made by 2 men , but i really liked it and the plot is so good , it is so hard for me to find something similar to it on the web . The movie has a unique style and its the first movie i've ever seen with this style . It has the same feel in the beginning , it's the same feel after a while , a feeling that it has a story and the plot is well thought out .|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube . For a low-budget effort , it has an interesting premise . A group of students at a rural college find a body in a shallow grave and try to figure out what happened . Unfortunately , it's not quite as entertaining as it seems . I have never seen this movie (and have no idea when I will), but I'm guessing it's an old, low-budget production . I found it at the IMDB site and it looks like something I'd like to try .|0
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason.|1
"If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed her name as a ""headliner"". I picked it up thinking, ""Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!"" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie."|1
"`` Flashdance '' meets `` Meatballs III '' or maybe it should just be called `` Meatballs IV '' .'' If you prefer to watch the movie in its entirety with the sound turned on, check this link:
[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097920/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097920/). You can also download the movie for free on their website (for now). I think this movie will be a little better with sound. Maybe I am wrong and there will be no sound, but still I don't see the point in watching it if you can't understand the words."|0
"I was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.Unfortunately, I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of ""twists"" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act."|1
Alright ! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg in the final showdown. It’s a pretty big deal to be a part of this film. In the last days of 2012, it was announced that a new feature film would be released in 2013 by Paramount. We knew the movie would have a big action element to it. There’s going to be a lot of big baddie moments where you’re gonna have to fight to survive or at least stay alive.|0
"OK,I've seen over 100 Troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" was horrible, and ""I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist"" was unwatchable, but this is THE WORST FILM IN THE TROMA LIBRARY!A bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.This is really terrible. Even as exploitation films go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs."|1
This is a total piece of crap . It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert . It is an insult to the original movie by Stanley Kubrick and it is also an insult to the books by H. P. Lovecraft . It does not even know that Lovecraft created the Cthulhu Mythos . It also does not know that Lovecraft had a brother named H.P. H. Lovecraft . It is not an honor that Lovecraft has a brother , it is a disgrace . Cthulhu is an ancient name that Lovecraft has no relation to it , it does not belong on the cover or the title .|0
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning . Motion pictures are works of art that take days to make, even weeks, to complete. They are an art form. But they don’t just exist in a bubble. We have an entire community of movie fans who come out to theaters every time the movie is released. We love the characters. We love the stories. And we love to go to the movies. There are so many movies to see, and you can go to most of them on demand.|0
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just because I didn’t enjoy it as much as I did last year. There was a lot more to it last year. Some of this has to be because of changes that have been made. I’ve heard people talking about how they liked the first movie, but then it wasn’t as good as people said it was. This year, it’s almost like the second movie in a longer series.|0
From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights.|1
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today . Many consider just two out of the year 's best picture winners, Thelma and Louise, to be the best American film in decades, and the Academy seems to be on the rebound as well. With all of the Academy's recent decisions, and the Academy's ongoing push to get the industry more representative, I wonder how this new era of Academy awards for film will shape the future of films, and whether or not those films that we consider to be 'American' are moving in directions that are different from mainstream American cinema today.|0
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say ""fake"". ""it's never been disproved"" also is a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada."|1
"This is a great little movie , full of interesting characters and situations . While not in the same class as ""Logan's Run"" , or even ""Rise and Fall "" (though it certainly has the best ending of any movie I've seen in a long time), the movie has a lot going for it including a great script and good acting performances . You've Got the Love, You've got the Money - You've got the love - You've got the money - And now you've got the fame, you've got the money - And it makes perfect sense, I should know."|0
Well , this is new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror film director and actress. He shoots it in one of Italy's oldest and best preserved film archives. He does this in an attempt to capture the atmosphere of the 1960's Italian horror films, including his own. The film is about Fulci and the actress that he is obsessed with. He tells her he has been writing her story and that he doesn't want her to be alone while filming and instead wants her to be with him.|0
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! How can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? Maybe part II will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! I have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!|1
"Down Periscope is not a ""Great Movie"". But then again very few flicks are. So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a ""great movie"", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must take on the entire US-navy with it's nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome."|1
"I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story , and what a great way to spend a Saturday. The story is based on the life of the real life Eddie Monroe who was a veteran who served with the U.S. Army in WW I.

Monroe worked his way into a position of power and leadership at the University of Texas where he played a role in helping them win the 1936 national championship. The film also stars Kevin Costner as Monroe and was written by Scott Biesenbeck."|0
Please do not go see this . I did have several laughs throughout this movie , but they were all very low-key , and I have no clue as to how they are going to come up with the next one. I did have several laughs in this one as well, but I really had to stop because it was just not worth it, not even for laughs. After this is a complete waste of time, it's like trying to see a comedy show. There is a guy in the crowd that always sits in the aisle and laughs like he is in an episode of Saturday Night Live.|0
I was unsure what to expect from `` driving lessons '' - unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a heavy load. So I put the question to him. He replied: ''You can learn driving from any man who can look at a car and say how to drive it''. So that's why he is the best driver I know, he can look at a Ford and say 'that's a nice car' and know what kind of driver it takes to drive it properly. I know he could do with a few lessons himself, he is a lot better than me with cars - and women.|0
"Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist ( Mike Connors ) and his wife ( Linda Liao ) who mysteriously vanished during a trip to Paris that was paid for by their wealthy boss ( Mitchum's ex-wife, Anne Bancroft ), played by Richard Widmark. It was the first time the pair of them had seen eye to eye, and Mitchum plays them like a couple. There's a terrific scene where he says, ""You know I have nothing to complain about. It's like I married you. I never complain."|0
"This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos . It is a documentary about one of my favorite actors and directors of our times, Fritz Lang . It's also a good time to learn a little more about Lang . In the beginning, we are taken to his early years in Berlin and on the lot where some of his early movie work was shot . He was there from the beginning of 1933 until 1937 . In this period he made about 20 films . Among them are: "" The Testament of Dr .J.B."|0
I wo n't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating , plenty of other people have already done that to some extent. I can only say that if I didn't like the film I would have rated it much higher. But, I did. And, with that in mind, it's probably the only film in the world that I have enjoyed more than I should have . . . . . What I will say is that I enjoyed this film much more now that I have finished it.|0
David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over.|1
"I expected a lot more out of this film. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. Bottom line is that ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier.I really like Grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing. The character is designed well, but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think that his character was explained too well. I mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to become a woman."|1
"and there are not many in cinema history. ""Rouge"" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in mankind and in life. But to say only that may be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces."|1
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema . In the early years of the decade, both Lenfilm and Mosfilm were struggling with the cost of producing feature films , and it was felt that state subsidies were no longer available for the former and the need for foreign co-productions for the latter. In May 1946, Soviet film director Oleg Yuriev, who had been assigned to the Mosfilm film studio since 1939, resigned. This resulted in the immediate dissolution of the studio into a series of small film production studios in which each of the four major Soviet film studios operated.|0
"Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar, it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.The plot line may have been a little thin, but what B movie isn't. I understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging every movie like it is an Oscar contender, just silly."|1
The Mummy 's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films , and it seems that this film is the best of them all, in some of the scenes it gives a real horror feel and in others it is just great. The mummy is very creepy at the beginning but as soon as she appears we understand that she is a trickster. She seems to have a great sense of timing and her movements are very slow, which makes for a great horror experience, as she slowly approaches us.|0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again.|1
The mission to see the movie `` The Cave '' was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the movie `` The Day the Sun Stood Still,'' in which the scientist played by Gary Cooper is stranded on a tropical island, stranded alone with the only human in sight, played by Robert Newton. Now I would like to see the movie `` The Cave'' with a very special person, but I have to leave for a week or so and will not be available. In the meantime, I am hoping you would make up a question for me.|0
I do n't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in , but this is the very first movie they've ever seen and they loved it! I am not sure whether to feel flattered that my film review is being read as a compliment or insulted that this is the very first movie in which a reviewer actually saw it! Anyway, my wife and I had a wonderful time this past Friday night and were very impressed by the movie. It is a wonderful romantic comedy and we had a wonderful time and were both very happy about the whole experience.|0
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it doesn't have any continutity. It feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software!!! Music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby deol is good.|1
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also The Floorwalker in this category.Charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.There aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator.|1
One of Chaplin 's longest films up to that point , Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex satire on modern feminism, with a cast of women and men who all seem to find themselves in positions of power and control. I was not a fan of the film, mostly because I thought the women were all over the place, and I did not understand their motives. It was very difficult for me to relate to the women, as they seemed to me to be very different than the men. The film had a very interesting premise of a woman in charge who was trying to reform a system.|0
I watched Love Life on holiday , when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida . It was the only film I didn't know about, so was really interested to see it . The film is about a girl who falls in love with a trans-masculine man in San Francisco who she meets through an escort service . The love life of a trans-male is very hard, and I can relate to this , especially with my last relationship , where we had been together 6 years , but the trans-masculine men don't understand us and don't accept us .|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning . Well I was drawn to the fact that it was about the first time I’d ever written a ‘blog post’. It is a very old one – it’s from 2001 – but I am glad I wrote it because the words are still very true to this day – it is a great reminder that the most important thing any parent can do is to be honest with your kids. It is the only way to be honest with them about your feelings and thoughts about your family, especially when you have kids like mine.|0
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which has n't been given the credit it deserves . It is a beautiful film which is full of heart and tells the stories of a community that is being destroyed. The film has been shown in over 70 countries and it is just one of the best documentaries ever to be screened. A young woman is walking to a bus stop when a man follows. The young woman turns to run down the road but the man grabs her wrist and tries to stop her.|0
It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull off Shakespeare's Othello, by bringing it to modern day context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. There were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending in Dessie's death.|1
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year, but it's been revived by CBS. It was originally supposed to be an anthology series set in the 1970s, with an all-black cast and a female co-creator, but the plan was scrapped. CBS then made it part of the CBS All Access streaming service. On Sunday night's broadcast of CBS Sunday Night with John Dickerson, co-creator (along with actor/filmmaker Spike Lee) Will Smith announced the series would be renewed for its seventh season, with 20 episodes over a two-year period.|0
"The recent documentary ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart,Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. If he hadn't been under contract to Warner Bros. he would've of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator."|1
Just saw this at the cinema . I have n't read the books . There is nothing new about this , and it was a waste of my time . I am sorry for the people who were disappointed with the movie . I don't want to go to see this movie . The only reason I liked the movie was because i have seen a similar movie before . I will not go see this movie again. I really enjoyed watching this movie, it was interesting with some good twists and turns and a good message that we are all vulnerable and we need each other.|0
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. A bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.It's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex.|1
"This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of ""Touching the Void"", one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event, and I'm relieved that it didn't let me down."|1
We've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. In fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on June 25, 1945.The war on Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a Nazi spy ring was helping out the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater.|1
"I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes ""Legally blonde"" look like ""The Usual Suspects"" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie."|1
`` Hood Rat '' is absolutely terrible . This is a urban version of `` Willard '' . I just can't take it seriously enough to be angry . It's not funny , it doesn't move , it's not funny , it doesn't make any sense . I just can't see how you can make it any good . You're a terrible writer . This is a joke , and you're just playing around on it . This is a bad movie . It's not funny or moving and you just waste time and money .|0
"first off , i 'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site ! but what's even more amazing is, this movie was supposed to be released in India on 2nd october , and it finally got released in India today on 10.07 . i can't tell you about the review i've been reading so far though , so i will let you know when i do find time to go over the review of the film :)

1st , i must say, this is a very cool movie !! i know , it's not the same type of film ."|0
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison, is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English. Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.|1
I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show 's `` contestants are. They don't know what the hell they are doing. They think they are funny. I watch this show with my 14 year-old in the basement in the dark. He can barely see anything because he can't turn his head to the left. So I have been able to observe him at work. When I saw this program last night I had to turn the sound way down. I don't think there's a whole lot of material for the first season of this series.|0
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes.|1
I was sorely disappointed in this movie . Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were not worth it. There are scenes that are so boring it was hard to listen to the characters. The acting is average at best with only the lead actor in the lead. The story is pretty much one dimensional with a twist in the tale at the end. The story is told from two different angles. The first angle is about a teenage boy who gets picked on in his high school by some girls. His best friend is one of the bullies in school.|0
"Let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...I mean a ""truly"" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. I admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And although I'm giving this film a 1, I highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: Aussie Park Boyz."|1
"This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame , fake-looking bird puppet which is supposed to depict a moose. And, to top it all off, the whole thing has to be viewed from the side. It's hard not to feel a little bit sorry for this moovie because, while it's fun to watch, it looks rather silly. The other thing that the moovie does so well, besides being fun, is making fun of the ""reality"" of moovie films. This movie is so fake."|0
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life . While I like how the director was able to put a lot of humor in it I was very disappointed that he did not try to go for a more intense scene but tried to keep the comedy in . I guess it was one of those movies that was too long so I just couldn't get enough of it . I was wondering how many times I was going to get to watch a movie and then I realized how I had only watched 10 minutes of it ! But I will definitely be watching the other 10 .|0
Look , this film is terrible ... the `` plot '' involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents and have to fight to survive on their own. Why in the world would you choose to make this film? It just isn't very interesting to me at all. I was going to start a rant about this movie but I decided that I'd save the trouble and simply write a review. If you liked the book or the movie then this review will probably bore you to tears, but then again so will most reviews.|0
...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its a kind of mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! If anyone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.|1
I hate to admit it, but they were right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone.|1
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_ , and _The Wild Life_ comes up with a number of familiar faces. We hear the voice of Andy Kaufman in the opening voice-over, with his distinctive drawl, and then see him in several episodes, including the opening sequence of the second episode and the opening credits to the first episode. And, as in the movie, we first see the kids running around, in the opening credits to the second episode. In the movie, though, Andy's voice-over says, ""Ridgemont High was the worst school in the whole world."|0
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics . Sure , it 's fluff , it 's not ``real , "" but it 's Christmas , it's one of my favorite movies , and I'm including it here for some of my other classic Christmases . (It 's not the first film I watch every Christmas, either . I usually end up watching a couple movies I 've seen at my local theater ) . And there 's only one Christmas movie I 'm not particularly fond of . (That one , I haven't actually seen , yet.)"|0
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus the death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola.|1
First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie, I can't comment on that.However, I DID see the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on that Channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.I've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so.|1
The threesome of Bill Boyd , Robert Armstrong , and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of a blonde woman .

The three of them come to the carnival where they have been assigned . Bill and Robert arrive in a hot air balloon with their female companion , but are mistaken for a trio of thieves by the bouncers .|0
"There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you have some idea of what these two are like. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once."|1
"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. It came no wonder for me that this is admired by most American viewers and hated by Europeans. This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.You have been warned. It doesn't even have ""guilty pleasure"" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.I wish I could enter negative values, admins?"|1
Christopher Nolan 's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out . Shot on a $12 million budget, The Dark Knight Rises continues to be seen as a masterpiece , even if it is, as always, full of flaws. It's hard to find someone who doesn't consider it the greatest superhero film ever made, or that it can be improved upon. I can say the same for Christopher Nolan's next film, because it's not the kind of movie you can change, at least not without making some major changes in how the movie's characters and plot are presented.|0
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a.|1
Uggh ! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s ! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by my father’s ill-fated taste ! And yet they were the first cartoons that I was ever able to sit through! My parents must have had a sense of humour, but they must’ve also been inarticulate at times ! Now, as I sit on my sofa and watch this latest instalment, I can’t help but wonder how many of my readers will be able to relate to this new cartoon.|0
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey's character DIck Harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either.|1
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that he pines after. In the same unfinished château he built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group.|1
Sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A. Fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his cinematographer, László Kovács) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel.|1
This is only the fourth effort I’ve watched from this director (whom I met and found quite genial at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – I’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone!|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward ... granted i am an avid horror film fan and this movie was no exception ... i will admit this movie had me a little bit scared at times but i was in awe of the acting. this is one of the few horror flicks i have ever seen that i really enjoyed. i highly recommend this movie to those that love horror films and enjoy watching them. I am looking forward to the sequel to this brilliant film. I know i won't be disappointed.|0
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. This movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" - 1941, and ""Heaven Can Wait"" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. The closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment."|1
Allegedly the `` true story '' of Juana de Castilla , the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (or Isabel la Catolica) the Second, was written in 1526 by her sister, Isabella Fernández de Castro , the author of the celebrated work '' Historia Compostor de los Reyes Católicos.'' It tells of the death of Juana in the arms of her husband, the Duke of Medina Celi at the very moment the Duke, who was about to give birth to their daughter, had been betrayed by his wife, Juana.|0
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That 's reason enough to check this one out, I think, even if you've already seen her work. I don't remember where I got this video from. I remember the title and description but that's all.I saw it mentioned in a thread somewhere on youtube and checked it out. I was surprised by how good it turned out. It was quite an interesting experiment in the editing, too, to give the viewer a choice. It's an interesting experiment in a lot of areas.|0
"I generally LIKE Sion Sono 's work , but this movie was completely retarded . But sadly , not retarded enough to make me not want to rewatch the movie over and over once again . It's just very difficult for me to sit through one more episode of ""The Vampire Diaries"" . I like the episode of ""The Vampire Diaries."" It wasn't the best episode by far but it's a lot more fun than the first episode, and we get to learn more about Caroline. I do hope they do another episode. This episode was okay."|0
Not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them.|1
What an awful movie. Full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. It is hard to believe the same guys that wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of Top 10 Worst Movies of All-Time. Didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Let alone make a sequel for it!!?? Amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released!|1
It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children?|1
This is an extraordinary film . As a courtroom drama , it 's compelling , as an indictment on the way American justice system works today . However , as a cinematic treat , the film is not nearly as satisfying as it could be . The film has two main plot points , the first is the way the case was handled . The other , the case is not treated with enough respect , and that makes it seem a travesty , in the sense that it should not take the life of one innocent person , in such a horrible way .|0
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen . the acting was god awful , the story line was stupid , i just dont even want to write a review on this movie . this is a stupid movie and i just dont even want to watch it. i am going to give this movie one star because it had potential and i liked a lot of stuff about the movie but this movie was just way to far off from what its trying to be . ive given it 1.5 stars . and this is how bad this movie is. its horrible .|0
"First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular . The cast is like the saved by the bell type characters and the director is kind of overrated and just plain boring . The only thing that keeps you going a little longer is you know that it doesn't end well . What I really wanted was an epic film that you would have been happy with . Unfortunately, that was never to be

So what did you think of the movie ? Do you think that you would have enjoyed the movie if the plot was a little better ?"|0

"A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope that's what they were going for because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been."|1
... with a 500 $ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no special effects then this may be the only one for you. But it was not your money and your brain. So don't go in with an expectation that you will be watching a movie. I would rate the film 3 out of 5. I have a feeling that many will not be able to handle a movie with a budget like that. And for that you may not enjoy this film at all. Don't be disappointed though.|0
"I am very impressed by the reviews I 've read of this film - generally well-read , thoughtful and informed - and I can see why people think that this film does what it does

But there are so many reasons to say ""meh""

1. It's not a documentary at all but more of a documentary feature film. It's not very long at 2 hours 40 minutes - and if that's the case then the audience should get bored with it by now. This is really disappointing because, as I've said, this film does not need to be told as a story."|0
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh OK I'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'Nightbeast' emerges, OK so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people.|1
this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. I've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. This show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. I dislike that crap..i have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. The 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. I seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up.|1
I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance.|1
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington , Ky last night . After a wonderful evening with my friends , I walked back to my car . I was very aware of all the noise that was around my car , but I was also aware that what I was thinking and feeling were probably being recorded by everyone in the movie theater . After about twenty minutes , I got out of the parking lot and started my ride home . As I drove past the theater , I noticed that everyone in the theatre was still there , watching this movie I just saw .|0
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.|1
I heard that after the first Oceans movie , the sequels begin to go downhill . I believe that this is true because the last movie is really good, but I am not sure whether it is the last movie or not . I heard that in the last two movies in the series , the producers were planning something , but I don´t know what they did with it . There is a lot that I don´t know , such as which character will get which role , or which characters can be replaced with new actors .|0
Imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. Otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens.|1
Just finished watching 2FTM . The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, which is how much of a sucker I was. I found out that 2FTM was a remake of one of the more beloved anime's in the past 15 years. So I decided that this remake was well worth seeing since it was so much better than it's original. So far it's not even close. It's nothing more than an extremely mediocre and poorly thought out version of one of my favorite anime's in recent memory.|0
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvellous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score, and witty, light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous, the results are hilarious.|1
"First off, I'm a huge Bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. I watched every film he made on the big screen since ""Love and Bullets"", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood-blockbuster star.I kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latter films."|1
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram. What a come down from Fox values and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox films. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan calmly walks across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter along, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown.|1
A snore gore . I saw this piece of horrible , stinking , worthless , junk at the Cameo Movie in Hollywood, California, when I was just a boy . It is the most hideous thing on God's Earth . It is absolutely horrible . It would make you shudder if you could see it . If I could live through it I would go mad . It made me sick . It made me want to give up . It brought on a nervous disorder . If I could take it back I would do it over again .|0
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes , this entry ( the fourth ) feels tired . Toshiharu Ikeda's script doesn't have the energy or spark of his previous three , but the director, Tatsumi Hijii , wisely avoids being overly showy or overlong in order to keep things interesting , even though he does have one of the better soundtracks of the series , but the score is still forgettable , with songs that sound similar . It's not bad , and there's an element of charm to all of the characters that keep things going , but at the same time , the plot can get repetitive at times.|0
"The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at ""My Maisonette"". Hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of ""alternative comedy""(I hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on TV today.I'm glad that on a trip of local DVD retailers today ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" was sold out across the board."|1
When I saw the trailers for this movie , it looked like a good romantic comedy . I expected some comedy from the trailer. I was wrong. I thought the movie would have some romance, a little humor, and a little suspense . But the romance, humor and suspense were all terrible. The film started off with too much romance . And by that, I mean one of the characters, who I thought was the only one in the movie who had a bit of a romance in him, suddenly turns into the love interest. Then the comedy was way better than I expected .|0
Apparently this movie was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminded me of how when I see that someone has been murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I move on. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point?|1
"While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography ( I thought a more purposeful approach would have been the better choice), what's to say they were wrong? Quote:

It was good, but not great. The ending was just meh. It just didn't feel like the end. The ending felt like the beginning of a new film, it felt like an epilogue, and not like the end. That's an interesting viewpoint. That I think is a common feeling when I see films like The Shawshank Redemption, or even, like I said, A Fistful of Dollars."|0
"I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie . What is even more stupid is that it's rated R and yet it's shown in school and everyone is supposed to know that. I would not have recommended this movie to anyone . I hope they sue the makers or at least tell the makers and distributors that their movie is ""Not Recommended"" or even better they tell them that there are some things you just don't show your kid. The movie has a great script and the movie makers made it entertaining . I enjoyed it very much ."|0
Dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no cash Sofia Coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus. The cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b&w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance.Yet there are one or two things to note. Inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots.|1
This film wasn't good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever.|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first ( and probably the only) people with the idea to do it all. The idea was inspired by a tweet. This is an idea that I am working on, as I mentioned in an earlier message. While I am in no way shape or form sure about how this will pan out ( and the idea to do it all is still there) , I wanted to get some input from you, to see if there were ways you thought would work and if you thought the idea was worth pursuing.|0
"Can't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as ""Special Thanks"" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock YOU'RE AN IDIOT."|1
Predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page.|1
"""Driving Lessons"" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (Linney), and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.Grint's portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film."|1
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military.|1
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood , and this nearly hit all of them, except for one, which is a minor quibble. And it is a quibble I’ve heard a lot from people who went into this film with high expectations. But this quibble is the same quibble that I’d hear from anyone going into a Stephen King novel. I’d heard it too many times myself to ever dismiss it as just a quibble. The thing is that this quibble is that, in a very literal sense, it isn’t.|0
"I was unsure what to expect from ""driving lessons""- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie."|1
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by Hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities.|1
Christopher Nolan 's first directorial effort , a year before he did `` Memento , '' and this is almost as much a story of how he became a director, his process and the lessons learned as his films themselves. He spoke with us about the movie and his career in Hollywood and beyond. Movies & Culture: Your first movie was about memory: the film was based on a real event that you had read about. Can you talk a little bit about what that event was, how it came to be and what was involved in shooting it?|0
"I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance . I ca n't imagine anyone smoking pot and saying to themselves , ""Hey, let's see if this is as good as the weed I'm getting."" It's not a stoner movie in the traditional sense of the term . What it is is one that takes you into another universe, that of the potheads. It takes you into a world beyond the norm and a world that doesn't accept the rules as they exist, in the real world."|0
First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent!|1
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.|1
That is the answer . The question is : What is the single reason to watch this movie ? I think I answered it in the first paragraph. What is the reason to watch this movie ? Why do you like this movie ? What is the reason that made you watch this movie? What would you love more in this movie ? I will answer all the question in the same paragraph. What is the reason that makes me watch this movie ? My reason is the love that this movie has to bring to my heart. What is the most significant reason that makes this movie amazing to me?|0
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs ( Naked Gun 1 , 2 & 3 ) and two seasons of its own made for TV show. Written by Eric Overmyer (The X Files ), produced by Joe Carnahan (Naked Gun 1 & 2) and directed by Joseph Rubenstein, the first Naked Gun is a crime thriller about two LAPD cops who are forced to work in tandem when a serial killer sets his sights on Los Angeles - and a city that can't take a joke.|0
"I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic."|1
I probably have to blame myself but I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title Sleepless in Seattle. I have to confess, I’ve been more than a little confused about what to think of Sleepless in Seattle. I’ve seen the film once or twice before, but as the story is about a guy in Seattle with a problem sleeping, what do I know? The film really does go by its own title, which makes it somewhat of a strange title. However, I suppose that it works well in some ways.|0
"Yes, why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's ""Psycho"" however, gives me pause. Why? I wonder."|1
This film is terrible . Not only is the story unbelievable , the situations the characters put themselves in are also way to out of the ordinary. It is a movie that you will not forget because of how horrible it is, but also because it’s hilarious . That’s not to say the movie is good or anything like that . The main problem I had with this was the lack of emotional connection or depth . The characters just have no heart for each other and the story is extremely flat . I would highly recommend this movie only to die hard fanboys of the series.|0
Love this little film , that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem , SHALL WE DANCE ? (also made in the 60's, and I am not sure which one comes first, the first in the Japanese one was made in 1970's , so maybe both were made in 1970's in Japan). The second one I liked a lot better than the first, but the third one has a similar theme , so it all works out. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I am glad I got to share this video with you.|0
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.|1
This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.The cast are good though, Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome A.J.|1
This was it! i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff.The one thing that i hated was that why was Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore!|1
'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east, her country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991).|1
"This film easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of ""12 Angry Men"". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie."|1
"The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  ""why""? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation."|1
"My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60's... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre.The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of Le Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious ""American business"" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?"|1
my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not Queens in NYC.Ramin Bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the OTHER face of American, but the REAL face of America.Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta' aperta.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors . His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses , The Apartment , and The Big Sleep have made him into a household name , but his other films are just as legendary. His portrayal of The Man in the Moon in The Man Who Knew Too Much is perhaps the finest of the genre. If you haven't seen The Man in the Moon , watch it now. This is an actor you have to see, and not just to see his acting skills, but to see him. He played the part like he was telling us about himself .|0
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film , this is the one I like to highlight. This comment was posted by an IMDB user with a unique username and has been viewed over 50,000 times since it was posted. It was originally posted on January 15, 2014. ""I like the way you are making fun of this film and I love it, but I don't understand how you can like an animated film that's based on a book of a book."|0
This is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to Penthouse Serenade just as the opening premise (Hoppity's coming) may well have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name Disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect.|1
`` Wagons East '' is widely known as John Candy 's last movie , as he died on the set of his latest movie in December 2008. He died at the age of 47, only a few weeks after the film's wrap. John had been suffering with lung cancer, but had undergone successful treatment to cure it in March. John was also a close friend and supporter of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, who had died on July 3, 1996 at only 24. John was in the studio for Shakur's funeral, where Tupac's funeral was held.|0
What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot.|1
You can take the crook out of the joint , but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the whole joint . I was talking to my mom a few months ago. I had been feeling a little out of sorts over the holidays, and was trying to figure out what was wrong. My mom happened to mention that a few weeks before we were all invited to our relatives’ wedding, a friend of ours lost a leg in a swimming accident at a pool, and I was wondering if she was going through the same thing I was going through.|0
I have just started watching this show . Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station. It just seems to me to be a load of rubbish. It seems to me the only reason it could have got as far as it did is because they were able to get the cast and crew to appear on television, and to get people to sign up to be extras, which, if I remember correctly, only about a hundred or so took the bait and agreed to go along with it.|0
"Two years after this short, the last ""Our Gang"" short was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. The quality of ""Our Gang"" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unfunny and Froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of film making."|1
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism . After all , Fun Fun Fun was one of his most acclaimed films and a major hit in the year 2000 . As I settled down for the second and final part , it began to dawn upon me how far the film had actually come in 14 years . This was a film I had never seen before , had never thought about it in the slightest until the film started to roll , and I had never imagined I’d see the end.|0
"If you 're looking for a typical war movie , this is not it , so a note to all the non-genre movie critics out there. This is not a horror film , so that's not it . It's not a drama , so it's not it either. It's not a love story , so that's also it . It's not an action-adventure thriller , so that's also it . In the end it is a war film , yes , and that's the main reason I liked it . __________________________________________________________________________________________

This movie was filmed in 1969 and released in December 1970 in the same year."|0
I started to watch this show by accident , but I love it . The fact that main character is blind is just a bonus , I think . The main character in the show is a kid who is in a situation like this because of his sister , but is also a very intelligent person . I liked this show , and was really happy that I got to watch it . And I also really liked the characters in the show and how they all seemed so real . I'm so glad , because I think people like this show and that's really great .|0
This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, naturally, is larger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and Courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. The period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial.|1
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the Jon Hall, Maria Montez films which have long since become camp. This one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. It's a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity.|1
"""Hood Rat"" is absolutely terrible. This is a urban version of ""Willard"". I just can't believe this movie got made, let alone distributed. Someone in Universal Studios thought that people would watch and like this ""movie"". The only good thing in this is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. The one thing I hate in movies is sped up action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Every scene transition is some fast motion special effect. The director should be banned from making movies forever."|1
"This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction . I thought that it would be good for a few decent stories to be written about the characters in that film and I also thought it would be cool if it had its own thread. If any one has any stories or photos of the cast, please post it here and we can add them to our gallery. There will be a list of the stories we've written for this thread in the future. As for this thread:

I don't actually know what I would call these stories. They all kind of fit together like a puzzle."|0
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would . I was stupid, I was wrong, I was wrong, I should have seen it before I said what I said and I would love to give you this excuse and I'm not asking for any sympathy or any sympathy, I don't care about you or me, I'm sorry, I wish I could tell this to you in a more constructive way but I can't . I can only say it in this way to you. It was an unwise, stupid decision to make.|0
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil 's apprentice ? who wants to , well , create an angel . But then , he 's forced to decide, will he have faith in the boy or the devil ? I can't believe it's been 2 years since I started watching the show. In case you haven't watched it, it's on the Showtime network. I really enjoyed it and the characters and the story lines were very intriguing to me. I've always had a fascination with the occult , but had no interest in studying them until this show .|0
This movie is absolutely horrible ! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union , Hill Harper , and some funny moments, that it would atleast have a good review . The plot is terrible . The first half is very funny . The second half is really boring . The first half could have been better . It just seems that it was rushed . The second half is not so much bad , but could have been better . I had a lot of fun watching it ! I thought this movie was good , I like it a lot .|0
"""You can survive anything"". Anything except a dumb horror flick. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of ""docu-comedies"": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. Some genres cannot be mixed."|1
I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't.|1
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater.|1
! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and the owner has to sell it. So he decides to buy it, but he gets it a little bit at a time. He buys it and puts it on his property, where he has to find a new place to live. When he finally finds a place, he has to convince the real estate agent that he will make good on his mortgage, because the place he bought doesn't fit in with him anymore, so he has to rent it.|0
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola 's masterpiece . I was lucky enough to see the movie twice on my own (I think) at age 10 and 12, the only way I could see it properly was to ask my father to rent it. I can't remember who my father was at the time, but I remember my mom sitting me down to watch the film and explaining the story and what it all meant. I think I remember her telling me it was the film that got her a scholarship to NYU where she would eventually become a professor.|0
"""Go Fish"" garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. The entire film rings hollow. I cringed the whole way through.Its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. Well not much more here to be learned than from ""In and Out"". By now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes."|1
"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said ""To Be Continued"" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more."|1
"Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen , clearly inspired by Rock Hudson 's "" The Razor's Edge ."" This movie had a huge influence on John Cassavetes, whose film "" McCabe & Mrs. Miller "" was loosely based on one of Day's plays . In both cases the basic material came from a stage play, in Cassavetes ' case from a long play and in ""Mrs. Miller "" from a short one. Day had been a successful television writer and playwright, and when he wrote the screenplay he was an established playwright too."|0
First of all , let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - there are many people who believe that I do. However - for the sake of this article I would like to put up with the fact that this is not a matter of faith or belief , but of science, and thus what we say here cannot be held against faith or belief. I am going to write a long article here, but in the first few paragraphs I would like to state a little about myself, in order to clarify the issue of why I am writing the article.|0
This is an excellent film , but Momento ( Nolan 's other big budget film ) is much better . It is not a documentary though , it's much more dramatic , and the way in which it is shot makes the film far better . It is very much like you were there . I love the scenes in this film . There are a great number of people who worked hard on this film . I know a few of them as I am a huge fan . It is a film that I had wanted to see for years , and I am thrilled that it is in front of me .|0
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind . One knows it 's going to be a big film . It 's one of the best films of all times . The director is Ramesh Sippy , and he has done a fantastic job . The screenplay has been superbly written by the best writer of all times . The film takes you through the life of an ordinary man . There is a time when all is right and he gets married . There is another time when the man gets into a great trouble .|0
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis . Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha . It’d be nice to see a version with the actors in their native Mongolian language. The actors have a limited repertoire of language to play with, I would have expected more out of them. I am surprised by the lack of emotion in the film . If you’re not watching it in a foreign language, this is a great film that should be seen by the Mongolian community. I’ve only watched the film a few times.|0
Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm? !,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.|1
"Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia ""goodness"" in the form of this soft-core Cinemax non-classic.A numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a ""black hole"" as the intelligent dolts put it. Pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. Pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.Ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin."|1
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood. The author is correct. The first time I tried it was when my son was about four or five, and we were walking down the stairs. He would be standing on one foot when the stairs were level, so we would be walking at the same speed as a person in a standing position would. My son started to walk down the stairs with his right foot and I would put the left foot just a tiny bit further ahead of me.|0
"I grew up watching the ""Bowery Boys"" on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. Still it was fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs would beat the crap out him. The East Side Kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am repossesin about my childhood."|1
As Muppet movies go , this is easily and clearly the best . It features loads of cameos by big name stars like the Muppets themselves, but I'm gonna focus on just three of them and how they play roles in this movie . As you can see in the photo above , there's lots of them , but this is the three that I want to focus on , the ones that make this movie worth watching . First of all , here's a very funny sequence that shows how these three Muppets interact . And , for good measure , here's another .|0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot . A virtual copy of The Cave is currently available for free on the Weta Workshop site and is also available on Steam. The Cave was the first feature length adventure game for the PC, created by Brian Froud, and it was released in 1995. The story is based on Froud's own experiences as a prisoner. It won the Interactive Achievement Awards 1995 in the categories of Computer Games and Interactive Art. This game was ported to the Sega CD and Saturn in the 1990s.|0
This is one of a rarity of movies , where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it as the movie progresses. You don’t even realize what happened until the end of the movie.

Do share your views in the comments section below. “I just want to thank you all for taking the time out to listen to what I had to say today”.|0
"""Flashdance"" meets ""Meatballs III"" or maybe it should just be called ""Meatballs IV"". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: ""This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it"". ""Gimme An F"" has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her ""Clueless"" days."|1
If extreme activities (and I don't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts's obsession to prove himself against great odds. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.The filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him.|1
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan . What could be worse than Hogan taking his talents to film and making millions off the Hulkamania he inspired? Nothing! And then, after Hulkamania, the film goes out to the world of professional wrestling fans to try and turn us into fans of Hogan's character, as well. If only he hadn't lost that match, and his career wasn't over, and the wrestling business was still going strong, would Hulkamania turn out to be such a flop?|0
It`s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I`m psychic ?!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time .|1
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today. Horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. I will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference.|1
I 'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott . I could 've done without the female nudity. There 's no need for that, especially if it 's the same actor and not a totally different one . But I guess in the end, it makes the film look a lot better . I actually liked this movie much more than the trailer. The movie is really good, and the trailer was kinda crappy. The story was quite good . Just don 't watch the first 25 minutes . It'll ruin everything. I would give this a 3 out of 5 .|0
"I think the ""Bone Snatcher"" should go after anyone associated with this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker."|1
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful ! Awfully long - even though they managed to make a decent thriller out of it. It was also very long, and the pacing was very inconsistent (it jumped from long scenes to very short scenes) - especially during the last 2 hours of the film. I didn't really enjoy it, but I can see why it was made, and I agree with others that the ending is a disappointment, although I do find it hard to put my finger on why. I saw it twice.|0
OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's (RIP) original 1973 film.What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!|1
"Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call ""humor"". That this movie, and Moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can out-isolationist Charles Lindbergh."|1
I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone . He 's one of my favorite actors of all time , and this is one of his best roles . It is hard to choose a favorite . He is very good in any role . I think his acting skills are exceptional . He will make any audience feel and think that they are watching a great story teller and a great actor . This is a very interesting movie. I've always appreciated Finney's subtle performances. It's hard to put into words but I really like this one.|0
"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?)."|1
"SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with ""Oldboy"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, ""sang"" means ""blood"" in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim."|1
I know my summary sounds very harsh , but this film has very limited appeal . The average Joe out there ( and I am a normal Joe ) does not seem to like this type of films , and its not just that we do not want to see the same movie in the same format over and over again . No , its the fact that these people just do not seem to get it . If this is a film that people like to watch , then there is a simple reason for that , and that is because the film works .|0
A traveling couple ( Horton and Hamilton ) stumble onto the town of Gatlin , where kids have slaughtered the residents for sport. They decide they will leave Gatlin, taking with them all the animals they find there. As Horton and Hamilton leave Gatlin , they are shot by a gang of kids who had been hiding in the woods nearby. Hamilton survives the shooting by the grace of an old friend. As they continue on with their journey they encounter a band of bandits and have to fight their way out. When they find the rest of the group, the bandits kill all but Horton.|0
While many pass this off as a B movie it is , indeed , a first class comedy that is both campy and very funny at the same time. And it does not disappoint as you will not want to put it down and do something else until the final credits roll. You will enjoy this movie a whole lot because of how well written this film was and how charming it is to watch. You will have the best time with this movie and you will watch this movie over and over again for your own enjoyment.|0
Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the film.Cobb doesn't know it, or doesn't let himself realize it, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the business from union organizers.Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. He's shocked -- shocked!|1
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent.|1
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight . I must say , I was blown away. I didn’t think I was going to like it, but boy was I wrong! I will definitely be going to see this when it is released on dvd. Hopefully, the movie has a great soundtrack as well! There was some good reviews in the local papers and I saw a review of the movie on IMDB, so I knew I had to watch it. This movie was an instant winner.|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much . It was a good movie . I thought that since it was the first movie I would see the first time in the cinema, I was surprised that it wasn’t any more of a roller coaster ride I was expecting. I thought that it would be a pretty scary movie . But it was more like a movie that would make you laugh and then scream. It had a nice ending too . Although it ended pretty much the same way the first one did.|0
"Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie ! It takes a long-winded bore to write a comment on a thread. I just saw it on the net and it seems to have more of an ""intriguing"" and ""suspense"" than ""horror"". It was very well done and a good movie at the end. I like the way it was made and very interesting as well as good story telling. The only thing I don't like was that they used a child as a victim. That was one of the best horror films of 2000."|0
I have always liked the Carry On films , with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy. I have seen Carry On London on DVD, and thought I would give it a try out in the theater. What I found was an utterly different experience, for me at least. I was expecting it to be silly, light and fun. Instead, it was actually rather serious, heavy and heavy-handed in its delivery. I wasn't laughing a lot, and had to put up with a lot of rather over-the-top musicals and songs.|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. If watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. Sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable.|1
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of `` The Ten Commandments '' and it fell short in a way it was never meant to by taking a religious story and turning it from a cautionary story about human sacrifice to a bloodlust story with all the drama, violence, and suspense that goes with such an approach. It's worth pointing out that there was already a history of religious films in the 1920s (and some that had religious content) - but few of them reached the same heights that "" God is Dead"" did at the box office."|0
This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.He also loves his mommy .It is based off the true events that I experienced with my own son and a woman I had a brief affair with when I was 19.There is a twist but it does not effect the film,at least it did not effect my view on it! This is the story of a man who was a victim of sex trafficking and was forced into servitude and sexual slavery. He is the first person to have his story made into a movie by a Japanese film company.|0
"I would not recommend it whatsoever . It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater , but with the possibility to get a free pass when it is your lucky day ! You have to wait in the very last row to buy your pass at the very end , the best part of the show . I was very happy to get my pass before the end of the show . What to see in Bangkok

If you are looking for a good time to see all the sights in Bangkok , you need to go somewhere else !"|0
Susan Sarandon . She made this movie for me . I 've never appreciated her acting more than as I watch the movie on a long car ride , with me and my daughters , while driving down a very beautiful California road . The scenery is amazing . The acting is fantastic , and the cinematography was amazing , as was the editing. I think you should make a movie . I don't think you will find any movie that is as beautiful as this. I was just going to post a little comment about her acting but I found that it was better to leave it in the blog .|0
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say , most of the other reviews I read didn't even bother with that review but they just raved and raved about what they were seeing on the screen . They even went as far as saying "" I never saw it like I did last night , and I've been going to the cinema since 1969"" and all that rubbish . But I did see it , it was one of the best films of 2016. My only problem with it is that it was made by a film maker who doesn't really know his arthouse movies ."|0
"This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson . You owe it to yourself to invest in this movie and check out the trailer for yourself. For the record, I'd like to mention, if this is the same movie as Underworld USA, then I want the sequel to this movie in the form of Underworld USA: Revenge of the Ninja Turtles, not this. I don't want my money being wasted in this movie! The plot synopsis for the original is as follows:

The Turtles face the evil Dr. Eggman in a new adventure, when Dr. Eggman takes over the island of Manhattan."|0
This is a very , very odd film ... one that is so odd it 's best you just see it and then forget about it. That's what I tried to do, at least. I had to see it once. But it wasn't to my taste. I didn't feel the way others have written it off and made me think it was the biggest, shiniest, sexiest sex comedy in the universe. What I saw was a film I didn't care for. This is a very strange film, that's all. And yet it's just what is.|0
"This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen. Probably ""Okul"" is the first turkish horror film. I must say that I were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. This shows that turkish film improves itself by time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, It was really successful."|1
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! !This beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. This one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?I give this a 10 out of 10!|1
"Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. Some have merely called the film ""contemplative"", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a Realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on."|1
( May contain spoilers ) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives . While it is most certainly an interesting movie , it doesn't have much going for it . The plot is pretty thin and it has a very limited plot . The film's plot basically consists of an attempt by people to find out what happened on Mars years ago . The story doesn't really go anywhere and it does not progress in a real way . As with most sci-fi stories , we don't see the consequences of the technology that's used in the film or if it ever will work .|0
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . Generic and boring , there are very few movies that actually work . The majority of movies have the same set up . You go to the cinema , get to the theater , sit through the whole movie , and walk out feeling like shit . You’ve already seen it a few times , and your mind has begun to get numb . You are going to have to see it one more time before you get anything else out of this experience .|0
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: There are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that I spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity.|1
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it.|1
How sad it is when a film as wonderful as `` Jurassic Park '' slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre nonsense, as with this dreary, dull-witted `` Return to Neverland. `` What is the matter with the writers of this film that they can't think of anything original? The story is that of an all-male band that gets stranded on a tropical island for six months while their plane crashes. We're told that the plane was forced to land because the pilot's wife had to go to England on business and couldn't leave him alone for a moment.|0
This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much.|1
Except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was patronizing and convoluted. Without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note.|1
Wow , Kiss the Bride was n't that bad , but it was n't that good either . It sure was n't better than any of the other wedding movies of that year ! What a mess , and a shame . I don't know if I have the same feelings about the rest of the wedding movies of that year. But then again, I'm not the one who is getting married. I just like wedding movies. The only one that I enjoyed is A Wedding In Scotland. It was a very romantic movie. But the rest, no.|0
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. Kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. This role was like many he had made already,One can see why he was a big star for so many years.He filled this role easily like a well used glove.The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a fine actor Robert Walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress Jennifer Jones).Robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films.|1
Pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. All the characters are OK, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing.|1
The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia 's `` Nine Lives '' comes when Sissy Spacek , hidden away in a corner, has a crisis of faith. Sissy: I don't believe that there's anything worth loving, nothing worth fighting for. There isn't, not for me. It turns out that her mother, played by the late Ann Sothern, was actually a prostitute who gave her up. The film is set against a backdrop of poverty, the Vietnam War, racism and the drug war, among other conflicts.|0
"The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief, too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first ""chase"" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well."|1
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon.|1
Loki, Norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad.|1
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing. Movies aimed at young adults tend to feature sex scenes with lots of graphic violence. Teen sex movies tend to have a much lower production cost and much better production values. But the only way to get a teen sex film is to get some young adult actors who are willing to put their careers on the line for that project. I believe this is a common misconception for many people. If you don’t already know it, there are lots of teenage sex movies.|0
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.I have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. Instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'The Deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery.|1
Supposedly , a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less destroyed by a UFO, is going to be released. The movie, according to reports, was originally going to be released in the US on May 21st and in Canada on May 22nd. Now there's no date mentioned for the US release. So what do we do with the information that's out there? How about a movie? The same way they do it in the comic books. The movie is called Alien Bounty Hunter.|0
Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. He, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., How sweet. Lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time, he is partnered with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty.|1
I did n't really HATE Mirrormask . I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . The visuals weren't as bad as i thought they woul d be . The acting was OK , i like the character of Jack but he didn't have anything to do that would make me care . And the plot to me was just way to dumb . I'm not mad at the film or Mirrors Mask , i like it but it just didn't grab me . I know some will say the acting was good for the film but for me at least i just saw it and it didn't grab me .|0
I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc, These movies constitute my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but whoever I was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. I don't think words could express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney brought.|1
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen . It looked so amateurish . Chris Hegedus was very good . I have seen a few documentaries that looked professional and this did not . In the few seconds that I was exposed to what was put forth by the producers , I could not help but feel as if they were going out of their way to discredit those who supported the war . But it did not take me too long to see where they were going with it and why . The whole thing is like this .|0
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares?|1
If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart , then you probably know about the $ 5 DVD bin that sits between the shelves and the checkout counter. This bin, along with an extra $ 50 you can earn, is a reward for shopping at Walmart. If you spend $ 50 or more in one day at Walmart , you’ll be eligible for a $ 5 “Discount DVD Gift Card.” If you spent $ 100 or more, the $ 5 Gift Card will be yours.

I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera.|1
"This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb , the design , costumes etc are flawless , the post production is superb, and the story is a masterpiece. It has all the elements needed to be a classic. I would highly recommend this movie. Gosh it was great. I've only seen one other movie, ""The Big Lebowski, and I liked it very much. I like the story, the characters, the dialogue. The only bad thing is that the characters don't seem like they believe in their own convictions."|0
"This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in ""Alien"" - and some decent ""he-man"" performances from the male cast. The possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play, ""Blood Beast"" might have been pretty decent."|1
I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian , but I am learning right now.I also have read the books and watched the videos, and so far, I do understand the parts of what he says.If this is so, please share with me , I would love to know why he says what he says. There was a time, and there was a book, when it was widely accepted that there is a god and that he does things. I would like to believe it still, but I do not know that. I find it is very hard to accept it.|0
I seen this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and great soundtrack. I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap (which I did not like)> This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but. This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *ROCK STAR* Yeah I said it.|1
"I love this movie. Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called ""big fat liar"". Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. I don't think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is."|1
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended, I was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.It's not bad in an entertaining way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors.|1
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal . Such an amazing relationship between parents and children as well as parents and son. I have a lot of questions and would like to hear the answers from both Mr. Mani and daughter. What was their relationship when they were not in touch with their parents and how are they now with their parents? What about when they are not with their parents. It seems that they had not had any relations with their parents and had to meet their parents for their studies.|0
This movie was terrible. You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain films combined. To start, the acting was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.|1
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer . They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same name. I saw the movie a week or so later and was amazed it was even better than the trailer. I had to stop at a stop sign to watch the movie. I didn't realize how much i was missing out on when i was at home in my living room with the sound down and the screen up . In the middle of the movie there was a small part that showed a woman getting in a car wreck . I felt so bad .|0
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who went off the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck?|1
"So bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers ""horror"" flicks? The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called ""uniforms"" the ""military"" jokers wear. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in ""Jurassic Park,"" but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here."|1
"I unwittingly walked into this ""trap"" of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a refund I would be happy.It was 7:30pm and Cinderella Man didn't start until 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and I dare say God reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing."|1
"I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. However I saw it on Irish TV recently and there was an added narration by Roy Scheider (""we're going to need a bigger boat!""). This ruined the film for me. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. I wonder at the new DVD version that has no Roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it."|1
Ed ( Kel Mitchell ) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger , a small but famous burger joint. After working for three days at Good Burger , he takes a night shift, and goes home to sleep. However, after he has finished his job he goes back to his flat and gets into bed with his girlfriend. At the weekend, he goes out for the day, but ends up in his girlfriend's flat instead, and she is not happy. When he returns at the end of the night he finds her watching porno videos on a laptop.|0
"This is definitely a touching movie, and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle. The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book ""the origin of Species"" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion."|1
This is a must-see movie . You will laugh , you will cry , and when it 's over you 'll be thinking of all the ways that this film coulda , shoulda , could not have been done better. If this film is any indication , then there 's no future for American politics. It's like watching one of the few American politicians who actually has an idea to offer, and what happens next is that everyone else is trying to make a big show of their own ideas in front of the camera , to the point that the viewer can't distinguish the two.|0
"There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. It was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. Compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. I kept thinking ""it must get better."" It got worse. And worse. How on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews I see of people actually loving the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad."|1
"I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. The acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood's actors appear life like. ""Sammy,"" the lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character."|1
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might).|1
Another first : this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer . Perhaps I 'm a bit spoiled by the fact that the French can produce a good film on any given day. So I was a bit puzzled about the name of this movie. The director was Pierre Billon, who came from France and directed the movie Les Américains, which won the Best Film award in Cannes. In this movie, one of the guys gets killed, which doesn 't change the fact that the ending was quite good.|0
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated.|1
"I did n't even watch this whole movie . Now , I like 50 's sci-fi movies even when they're cheesy. And I do agree with your idea that this is not a bad movie. Just don't over-analyze a movie with a very obvious plot. And the fact that a movie like ""Ender's Game"" is about to be shown on the big screen in cinemas is no guarantee of a great movie. That's what I mean. And the same goes for ""The Dark Crystal"" , ""Harry Potter "" , ""The Matrix"" , and ""Watership"" ."|0
"I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic ""Forbidden Planet,"" Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine a sailor? ), even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I guess he was a red herring, like Pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank."|1
"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II."|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker , Jr . He 's a young gun who has played the same character in the first film , and he 's also played the character in a couple of previous serials . He has a very good screen presence, and an easy, natural voice . There are some funny bits to his voice, and I suspect he 's been doing this for a long time , though he only appeared in one or two other westerns before this , and there are no signs that he can do any better as a singer .|0
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror , so far this season Masters of Horror has been the same old same old, with nothing new, or even really scary. If anything, the characters have gotten really annoying and just annoying, it's sad but I guess that's why they keep on getting paid so much . The main theme of this episode of the Masters of Horror is the story of what would have happened if Adam and Eve ate from an apple. It's pretty good for a horror story because it has some good visuals and some really cool scenes.|0
There is a lot to like in this film , despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about a little girl with a heart of gold and a little boy who is not quite right. The story is about a girl who is the daughter of a rich man. In a family that does not have any real social standing, she grows up in comfort. The film follows her life from a young age, through high school, to her time as a student at a local university. The film does not waste any opportunity to preach. It is a film about love.|0
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know...but how good is it? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****SPOILER****When a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow.|1
Michael Bassett 's film 'Solomon Kane ' ( based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard, also known as Conan the Barbarian ) had a big effect on me. But the reason why this film had that kind of impact on me, even though I had seen it years before, is the atmosphere. This film had an atmosphere of suspense, tension, fear, and mystery, all wrapped into one big package. It was very atmospheric to watch, and I guess that's the thing I love about it.|0
"I really liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good level-design, interesting and clever enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I am not by default against movie spin-offs of games. I thought ""DOOM The Movie"" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll has done here, is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible (well not the length, the movie runs only a merciful 90 min) The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement."|1
"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...The strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a real treat."|1
This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to . It is not a bad movie in the sense that it is mediocre at best , it is not a great movie , it is not a horrible movie . It is one of many bad movies , I’ll say this and I’m sorry to say it but if you have the time, it is worth watching . But it is not worth the money , the only reason that it is in this list is because it was released in the UK , and it was released on Netflix in the States .|0
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry in Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly weird Bubba Ho-Tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this TV episode. The plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. This time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac.|1
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director 's new zombie flick. So I think I can make an informed comment. I didn't know what I was getting myself into and I don't regret it. If I had, I probably would have refused to do the zombie makeup the first time I went in for the audition. But once I saw the zombie makeup, I knew I had to become one of those zombies. I saw it all as a job. I can't help being a fan of the zombie genre.|0
Okay, that was just brilliant. I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong. It really needed more episodes like this. The cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. Writing was fantastic and so was the editing. Great job in all accounts. The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. Which is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but failed until now. The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being this good.|1
"This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother."|1
This is marvelous movie , about a soul of Ale . This is a journey to Ale 's heart . And it is the movie of this journey that we are in , of how we were born , to Ale and how we grew up and what we learned from the years we have been with Ale . Then it was about how our life became a mess , and we started living our life with Ale and how we started changing and growing up and how the people around us helped us with the change . It was an emotional journey of change and growth of our soul and then it ends in a beautiful ending .|0
When this show began it was fairly interesting : we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through before the crab season. This season they’re just sitting around, waiting to go in and catch a few of those crabs and bring them on shore to be eaten. The crab fishing has become very expensive as well since they’re on the verge of a big run. The show is just as well done as its predecessor, and I think you’ll agree that the show is a lot funnier.|0
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world ! An absolute masterpiece , with a both bizarre and a beautiful tone that you can not watch in one time. This film is a must see in every genre, from comedy to horror to thriller to war and everything in between. Great job , great acting, great music and cinematography. It is a must for all movie lovers and fans of true fantasy cinema. One of the best films of 2018 , and if not for this film, you can not even call it a good movie.|0
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development.|1
"THE worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen allot. Acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! Ok, I admit, `Air Bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `Soccer Dog'. This ""dog"" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, don't watch this movie."|1
"Well, at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in America, they now discovered they could simply hire the Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. That's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! ""The Messengers"" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the Oriental countries ever since ""Ringu""."|1
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. The acts is so awful nor the plot. The story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, you name it! 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so below average film.|1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... You will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...It really pisses me of that viewers gave Reba 6.7 on their voting...Sure i knew there are some people with IQ lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them!|1
"Too much stock footage (almost one third of this 53 minute film) really slows this one down. Granted that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say ""Ro-DAY-oh""), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina-- even in the great ""Duck Soup"" [1933]) and the 'heroine' Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hey! it's her sister!)"|1
After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film , and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out with my finger nails in a futile attempt to see it through to the end, I'm now glad I did it. It's not a movie I'm likely to re-visit anytime in the future. But if you're into horror films, give it a watch if for no other reason than to see what you're all about. It's also well worth a few seconds' thought as an example of why I don't usually enjoy mainstream horror films: they are never good.|0
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose.The music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although I did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie.|1
A antique shop-owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley(Valerie Alston)gets put on a US District Court jury, on a trial of a known Mafioso Armand Asante(Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of Pirone attempting to get Whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. Much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with Willam Hurt as the go-between. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable.|1
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet ? I can see that a lot of other people are interested in it but i haven't seen any offers on it anywhere and i don't know why ive been waiting. I'd love to have it now as i don't want the series to become a dead series. In the meantime i'll just wait and enjoy what i have as i've been reading it on and off the whole time. I have read the second and third in this series and really like the first.|0
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen . When I watched the manga review in the wiki , I saw that the characters are too stupid to be believable . Also , I feel bad for the guy who made this . Anyway , the anime is very boring . The girls in the anime don't seem to have any personality . The story is very boring . For example , I would like to see the same story in the manga with more interesting characters , so the anime will become more appealing . I think the anime is not as good as the manga because of the lack of characters .|0
It is sad that some find this film worth watching . I am Russian , and I am disgusted . And I am ashamed to watch the film in Russia . It is a tragedy that in our country such a movie can be made . I know this film has been criticized by the people. The film itself is a story about a love story between two men . I think it would be a better story to have two women as love interest . I have seen the movie twice already . The first is in Russian with my family . I was disgusted to see how this film was treated .|0
"After the failure of `` Hellraiser III : Hell On Earth , '' the chapter that served as a kind of de facto death knell for the Bizarro film genre, no one expected a fourth film from director Sam Raimi to arrive in time for Halloween in 1989. Yet, in Raimi's own words, there could be no better choice for the film to make than to follow his most recent effort, 1997's '' Spider-Man 2.

'' The Amazing Spider-Man ' ' is widely considered the greatest comic-book movie of all time -- and it's an easy argument to make since it's as good as anything Hollywood has made since. ''"|0
This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row , public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, and the first few decades of modern American history. There is a bit of film history, a touch of romance, a dash of sex, a pinch of romance, and a dash of sex in between. The most interesting element of the film comes in the second half when you learn the real identity of the woman with the mustache. It is very enjoyable and even the most boring bits are worth watching if you have time.|0
This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do.|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is , if you 're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie like The Conjuring or something of the sort, it's going to end up being more of a psychological horror film. At the very beginning of the movie it appears as if our main character will be getting a divorce from her boyfriend, which will take away any sense of control over her life whatsoever. After all, we're meant to think, when does a person get to make decisions for herself and where are the limits of what's acceptable?|0
A satire about greed and money , what ? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in the money involved. You are right, in a way, there is a certain greed involved as well as a certain selfishness, but not the greed for power and control. I think that it is more about greed and control for the elites who want to maintain their wealth and privilege. They do not have a problem with the average Joe and Jane. They want to keep their privilege. They also have no compunction about telling the public what to think.|0
`` THE KING OF QUEENS , '' in my opinion , is a pure CBS hit ! Despite the fact that the original version was recorded by CBS , this is a completely new take which has not seen the light of day before. It may well be the most exciting version to date . I am also very pleased to say that it is the first and only episode of '' MYSTERIES '' in which the two leading characters of the series are introduced !'' The show is currently airing in Canada . I am sure we will all be hearing many more great stories !|0
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on TV or I've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much of a mess.ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first time director and it shows.|1
Not too good a movie . Sure , it contains action , but the effects are n't all that good . The scenes are boring . The action scenes are boring . The dialogues are too short. The story is weak . The actors are very poor . I would rate it with 1 star . The action scenes look so bad that it can be considered as a movie with no good effect . I hope the movie gets released on Blu-ray. This movie was the bomb! It made me feel good. It made me feel sad and also made me laugh.|0
OK, so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er, sorry . . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So sue me. I spent my whole Saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. I can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie I'd never seen, rather than read Proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.Which is to say, I didn't deserve Open Graves. Of which I saw none, incidentally. Were there any? Did I fall asleep?|1
This was a modern TV classic ! The story goes like this , Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia . When she gets pregnant , Bob wants to marry her and give the baby to her, but he is not able to do that. On top of the problem of being unable to marry her in his condition, he also feels that she is not a good person to be his new mother. Bob has a huge problem in life and he has to overcome it. He does so by taking all the things that he thinks are wrong in his life and turning them into gold.|0
Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless.|1
Firstly , few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent 's lover . Secondly , few women professors have sex with students . They are not afraid of being busted by parents . One of the most popular sex scandal from India is the affair of Dr. Pramod K. Bhargava , an obstetrician from Pune who allegedly had sex with students in his hospital. It was alleged that students of Poonch medical college were sexually abused by Dr Bhargava who is also the chief doctor in Poonch. A medical student and a resident doctor from the hospital in Poonch filed a petition at the district court on the case of the medical student.|0
"Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie--who woulda thought? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed--""Wisdom"" (with then girlfriend Demi Moore) and ""Men at Work"" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy films---badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on in pure curiousity--it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if it didn't pull me in.It concerns Estevez coming home from Vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there."|1
"Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist."|1
"I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. The only plot summary I can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high. (Spoiler alert starts here...) When the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the ""Demon Cop"", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a Halloween costume gone wrong. A car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running."|1
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. You can, however, see how far she has come.The one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s.The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting.|1
One of my all-time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film.|1
"Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best ""If Walt Disney had hailed from Texas, he would have made Grand Champion"" The movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (G rated) This is a masterfully crafted ""simple"" little film made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb."|1
This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself `` this is a decent enough movie , it would make for a good slasher flick ' . But the plot quickly descends into incoherent incoherence , it is hard to make any kind of sense of what actually is going on . This movie also has a number of flaws , for example in the case of the characters the plot does not pay them any attention at all , other than to bring them back into the story for more exposition . Also , the characters in the film seem to get a little bored by each other .|0
My mom and I , rented this movie . I mean , we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks , and we had a really hard time with the movie . The story is about a couple of young adults who decide to go on an expedition , to find the lost city of Atlantis and retrieve the lost library of the city . But the city they are going to look for is located deep in an underwater cave . I won’t give you the exact plot , but you should know that it is a comedy , and it’s a really stupid movie .|0
This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt government, crooked lawyers, crooked businessmen, and evil politicians. The term “dark film” can be applied to any of these films. The main reason the term “dark film” was coined was so that these films could get released in America at all. It’s not as if it was easy to get made or that American film making companies had to go out of their way to bring them over from overseas.|0
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact , it 's so nerve-wracking , I have not even told the story. The story is not about the main character , it 's about how the main character goes about his journey to find out about his father and his family . The rest of the film is about the love of his life , his wife and how their love story begins with the discovery of love at the end of a life long journey.So , when I tell you this story, I hope you have a smile on your face.|0
I'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS...) Why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. And how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...OK, OK...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity.|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great.|1
25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen : Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have always wanted to meet him. I have read a couple of his books but the one that got me on to him was Goldfinger, I really loved it. The only problem I had was I didn't get a chance to see him in the film version, it was years before I even thought of seeing it. I just had it on my to-read pile and I never got around to it so I decided to make my own.|0
A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( `` scapegoat '' ) for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a well written short with an intelligent plot. The author has used only the best of the tools available to the author and the reader and that is how the reader is treated. There is not a dull moment.The language is simple and clean, the writing is easy to follow, the dialogue flows naturally, the action is exciting, the love story is believable. All in all, a very nice read.There are only a few problems and they are all of the reader.|0
1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. Stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.|1
Cruddy , innocent .. no smoking , drinking or bikers , but Jeremy Slate ( good actor ) and Jocelyn DeBoer ( a great actress ). The film opens with a car chase and a chase scene. In the chase scene , Jeremy ( Slate ) and his gang are running away from the cops . After they are stopped , Jeremy and his gang start a car chase. The chase scene is so good and exciting with all the cars and motorcycles. The chase is a good film but it can be divided into 4 parts . This division makes sense for the plot and the actors .|0
"Well, this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a ""master of commercial suspense"" or maybe a ""compulsive technician"" -- or was he really ""deep."" Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at his best, he could not have been all three things at once.In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit."|1
Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland 's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - from giallo-inspired thrillers to creepy cult classics. Today the store announced that it will be selling a DVD box set of Italian horror maestro Luigi Cozzi's classic 1971 masterpiece, The Damned. The set, to be housed in a custom-designed, two-DVD set box, will be available on August 31. The Damned will be released as part of the Horror Collection, which will include other films from the director, most recently his 1979 horror/drama, La Notte (The Night).|0
"Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: Sean Connery as the wily Arab sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that ""big stick"" to good use.Aided immeasurably by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg."|1
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull . Well , after watching the movie , i have to say that this is probably one of my favorite comic book movies of all time. I like it a lot . But , i think this might be my favorite comic book movie i've ever seen . If you've seen this movie you'll understand why this is my favorite of all time. The story is great . The cast is top-notch in their roles. The effects are great . The soundtrack is awesome .|0
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture I can only think this is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. This movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.|1
Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution , one should sit back and enjoy the journey. I had a good laugh at the absurdity of a puzzle of such scope and such complexity. It was one of those “you never know what you’re gonna get until you get it” puzzles. And in that respect it was no different than many puzzles that we have all seen. And yet, in one sense I found it more enjoyable for it was more like a puzzle game where one had to play the puzzle to make sense out of it.|0
"As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who, well... are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget. Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films?FBI capture two buddies and send them to ""New Alcatraz,"" where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests.First rate acting all around, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys."|1
If you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll be happy to learn you don 't need the mainstream to entertain you . You can make your own entertaining entertainment , by making your own films . And that ' s exactly what I did . In making my own films , I discovered I had a very unusual talent and that I had become a filmmaker . For years , I had been telling other people that I was a filmmaker , but no one believed me .|0
Well it is a good movie . However , you have to admit that Van Dame 's movies have n't changed much from 's , but for a few scenes in the beginning of the movie , you have to admit that a few scenes and a few dialogues , but still , this is good movie , and Van Dame's movies have been good , so he is a good director . The plot is not that good of a movie , but this is a good movie and a good director . The main character , the movie was good . The plot was ok .|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. This is an oblivious labour of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full truly artistic elements. The movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by Mishima to him. All without being confusing in the least bit. The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won.|1
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it 's one of the few American films to be produced in the late '70s that did not use footage shot for a live television broadcast, it is not just the only film of its type made in that decade but one of only two or three films that have been made in the 20th and 21st centuries using live-action footage shot for television broadcasts. (The other film is The Matrix (1999) and the one-off film is The Adventures of Robin Hood (1965), both of which used live television footage and one-shots.)|0
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra.|1
"Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there's ANOTHER murder...so it's someone in that room.What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before ""Dracula"") who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector."|1
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea , May 1891 ' . A small lifeboat has drifted ashore on an island. We see a crowd of people. A young woman is standing on the beach. She speaks, then her voice fades and she disappears from view. A few seconds later we are taken to another beach. There are a few men and women swimming and wading. They appear to be in their late thirties. The caption informs us that the man and woman we have just seen standing on a beach at 'Port Royal, May 1891'.|0
"This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. Wanna know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead ""actress"" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted."|1
Yes , maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that does n't take away the enjoyment in watching it, it's the same with all films. I can't put my finger on it. I would have to watch it all over again but this is the best thing ever made. I think this film has a lot going for it but it's all wrapped up so well. I had no idea the first three films were a trilogy but the final act makes it very obvious. You can't really go wrong in watching this film.|0
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in the UK last year. This year it’s a different story. A new show has launched on Channel 5. It’s a good one, but not perfect. It could do with a good deal of tweaking before it got into the US. But let’s go for it anyway and watch the first episode. It’s set to air at 10pm on Channel 5 on Saturday 6th September. There will be no commercial breaks.|0
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on IMDb, I'll leave this comment here.Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film.|1
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie, looking at after war, psychical problem, from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of Vietnam war, causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father.It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past, with whomEmilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal, and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with.Protective mother looks at this problem with warm , and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.|1
This is one of the most horrible 'scary ' movies I 've seen for awhile . I had to wonder if they put this out knowing it would be the most disliked movie out there. That's why I never want to see a sequel to a horror flick. It's like watching paint dry on a wall and then having it flicker out. It's horrible. The movie is actually not that bad...but the acting, directing and the editing are horrible. The story is good enough, but is ruined by the poor acting.|0
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them."|1
"this is the worst movie in the world . the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the acting was not good . and i am an actor and have worked alot of acting jobs . i did the movie with my friend of 10 years . i think he could have made it better though . the acting was good . i know it was the best thing he could do though . but i guess that i should not tell you how i felt . just enjoy the film

well , i don't really think of the movie in terms of the acting , i think he did a great job ."|0
Bad . Bad . Bad . Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot people with the most juvenile of ideas. I'm going to make an exception and add my own opinion here. There are far better films out there. I'll start with some of my favorites, and then continue with some lesser-known gems, before concluding with a brief review of a few movies that deserve to be watched by the masses. THE WALKING DEAD: The first two episodes of Season 2 have been extremely disappointing to me.|0
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family : the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Anna Roos) a young woman and a member of a small family of three girls who live in the house. She has never seen the inside of a cinema. She is the oldest of four sisters. When she is eighteen (18 years old) she marries Charles Brighton (Kurt Wimmer), a young man from her father's village. Her life changes when her husband has to leave to join the army, and her father's estate is auctioned off to satisfy his debts.|0
"This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.Hilarity ensues.Like the ""Police Academy"" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes."|1
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels.|1
"Eddie Fischer was simply bad . Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a conversation with his son David about his upcoming visit to a hospital to get the results from a bone marrow transplant, and the kid had to interrupt him to get the conversation going: ""What's the worst thing that could happen?"" he asked. ""I hope he lives,"" said the dad. ""I think he'll be all right,"" answered David, then asked his dad what the ""best"" thing would happen."|0
`` Christmas in Connecticut '' is an absolute gem , and a must-see for Christmas ! Elizabeth Lane , a Connecticut native , has created a beautiful series of illustrations for this new version of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens . Christmas in Connecticut is just a little different from the traditional version because of its use of color. Rather than a white background , this new edition of Christmas in Connecticut uses deep blue, which is the most prominent color in this story. Elizabeth Lane has done an outstanding job with her illustration and her color scheme gives this new Christmas in Connecticut a fresh, exciting look that I just love !|0

Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!|1
I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences . I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact is this is what happened with Jon in the past? I do not believe it is good to let a person like this in the movie. I believe he is the one who killed his father. What is he doing in England? Is it to save his son or to take revenge for his father death? It was reported that he is to play a very important role in the next movie. And it was also revealed that he is going to be played by Robert Pattinson.|0
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one . The writing was awful , the acting was awful , and the plot was laughable . If you are going to spend $15 for this show , you should be very thankful it's on DVD instead of on cable . This is just a bad movie with bad special effects , poor acting and bad plot . I hope they make a second one for cable , but it would have to have better writing , acting and good special effects . If it's bad enough to get released on DVD it's not going to do much to impress anyone who saw this movie .|0
Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public , not me . But I have one last question for you . What is wrong with the American cinema? What is wrong with us? I will give you one answer . We have not yet fully learned how to do film criticism , as we do not even know how to criticize films . In fact , you would be shocked to hear that we do not know how to give good criticism , let alone good advice . But we are just starting to do that , I would like to say .|0
Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and empty movie about nothing. As in life, you are never sure whether to trust your friends or to distrust them, so it makes sense that you distrust Patrice Leconte's film about friendship. There is no story, plot or theme. Instead, there are three friends, three friends' parents (the film is loosely inspired by Leconte's own experiences), three friends and two friends, three friends and two friends and so on.|0
"""The Dresser"" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the ""energetic"" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."|1
"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork."|1
I like the shepherd ! Sure the acting was n't good but the fight scenes were nice . Van damme is a great actor and I think he would be great in the role of a villain . I just didn't think the role was for him . It's a shame because he would be great . This was the second movie I saw in a week and I thought this was better than the first. Van Damme was fine, not great, and it's just a shame he can't be the bad guy, since he seemed to be the only one who actually had to fight the bad guys.|0
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy schlock but the movie is actually the most sophisticated and creative movie I've seen since I saw the original Rocky Horror Picture Show. This is a film of real people that tell stories, like real people would. It's like a true documentary in the same way that a true documentary is a film by someone who knows the story of the people on screen, but who can't possibly be inside the story, or know what goes on behind the scene.|0
"""My Blue Heaven"" is boring. The plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. The leads, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.There's really only one reason to watch ""My Blue Heaven""."|1
"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous""."|1
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone ` s home movie . Drama schools must have been crazy to think this up . It's not hard to get a decent home movie camera, and I use mine almost every day. I was in New York when the first home movies were made, and they weren't good. The first film was made in a small, cramped living-room with very little light. When I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, there wasn't much light in my house.|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin.|1
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film , but for the controversial ending of the movie . And the story goes that Solomon, the main villain, had to make a choice to save his own neck or sacrifice his son to save his daughter's life. Unfortunately the film was cut for this very reason and Solomon dies at the end. But the truth is that the whole film has the same ending. So, there is no reason not to see Solomon and Sheba, as they have all the elements needed to make a good movie.|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
"The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...I first tought: ""Oh No, I don't want the trail that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent killer"". But this turned out to be even worse. Typically in this American film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. I want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. The audience isn't involved."|1
I agree with the guy above, It is so funny I understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I give this movie a 10 out 10.I have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month.|1
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film is going to end.The premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.Uhh ..no.The main problem is this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz its boring!|1
I rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.It starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. Its called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? Well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.Then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst.|1
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair , hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the characters I’ve seen so far. The only thing saving it is that at least he’s the only one who actually knows how to do anything, so he gets a lot of attention. There is always a lot of speculation about why he was chosen to do the narration, and I’ll save that one for later. The episode is really well put together and features a lot of character development for most of the people involved.|0
OK, this movie, was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion.|1
I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys . As I searched for the two boys . I kept looking for them to be just a couple friends . In the search I came across this movie . The story of this movie is so touching and beautiful . I liked the movie and I'm glad I watched this movie .I was looking forward for this movie for a long time now . I watched the movie with my mom and my brother . My mom enjoyed the movie . She told me how much she liked this movie .|0
What ever happened to shows with united parental figures ? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as their child's, and the parents never do anything to keep the kids safe. This show has one big problem, the kids are a lot of the same. I hate when people complain about bad shows for not having enough parents. I know what you mean. But then I think about all those shows that have good parents. In the world of bad parents, they have parents who have great kids, not just kids who do well in school.|0
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had 350,000 dollars to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie....Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this movie....To small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better.|1
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.|1
This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . It 's supposed to be a remake or sequel to The Sixth Sense, but it isn 't . In fact, it really doesn't make any sense . For example, the police don't know that this is a movie and won 't admit to it . The movie also has no plot, no reason why this is happening or why it 's happening . There is a small amount of violence, and it isn 't very graphic . It 's not very good . But it's not a horrible film .|0
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning. Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor.|1
I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well.|1
"Dire! Dismal! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing!Right, your trapped in ""The Cave"" with several ""hard"" Men and a Woman or two, your being systematically killed by ""Something"" and you STILL don't get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A 15 Cert' here in England, and you could tell!The Egos of the ""Macho Men"" was just too much, pass the bucket I'm going to be sick.This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever."|1

No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. Canada becomes part of the USA. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the USA. Silly me. Continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South have to be among the most imaginative series ever.|1
"The MTV sci-fi animated series ""Æon Flux"" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all."|1
Actually , Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times ... mostly due to the cartoonish jokes and the fact that the story was very well thought out. And while it was not very deep I believe that it made me laugh more than the previous two stories I read and enjoyed. In the past few days I have been revisiting my copy of The Book of Skulls . As with the previous books in the series this time I have been having a hard time coming up with any good reviews for it ... well , to be honest ...|0
The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker ( played by Drake Bell of the television show Drake & Josh). Drake has been hired to make a film about Spiderman, he is a good enough actor to be believable as Spiderman. It is very obvious the director wants to make the movie more comic booky than the comic book film. I was surprised when the scene where Spiderman saves a boy from a fire. Drake does a pretty terrible job of acting the scene and it makes me wonder how believable the scene would have been had Drake not done such a poor job.|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter.|1
I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the plot, though I thought it was a bit too cheesy for its time. The premise was that a group of American soldiers are sent to Vietnam to help train local villagers. Unfortunately, they get captured and captured by their own troops, so their only way out is to make a raft and sail down a river to freedom, which they accomplish. There was one major flaw in the script that I found to be extremely annoying.|0
"The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it IS fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.This film, in short is atrocious."|1
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it's natural that I'd choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting.|1
"Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a film with these two together for the first time! Now imagine THE WORST film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to ""Night Vision"". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction."|1
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all is the plot a very thin plot (Wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN!!!!!!!!!!|1
"Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country, which is always the Northern part. If black people were shown this way, there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons.This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the ""clever"" farce clichés. But it's mostly tiresome. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudice.Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality. This is not funny."|1
"This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work depicts. Ward and Dalton aren't so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince. She was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward ""Why can't I move you?"""|1
This was a great movie . It had one `` sot-so-nice '' outburst . Plus there were some very intense and emotional moments . I love it because it is an example of how movies can do what books and poems do , and it's a very powerful and memorable movie . I was so excited to see this movie . I haven't seen anything like it . I had never seen anything like it . It is one of my favorite movies . I was blown away . This movie has the ability to create an emotional reaction . It has the ability to create an emotional reaction in people .|0
Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film.|1
"A bit ""the movie in the movie"" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the ""real"" one.As any Cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. Can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it."|1
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic , as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the fact the government was trying to cover up how much the cost of a programme such as EHIC has really gone up. I think they did it because they had done it before and then realised how bad they had been doing. I think that is the real problem, not the media coverage. I also find the idea that it is the NHS’s fault as much more likely than the government’s. They are not being honest with the nation, but instead are lying to themselves.|0
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening , thinking we were going to watch something that would provide some much needed entertainment, well the cable bill came in for $3500. I called his service provider and found that he had not signed the contract with the provider for this service. Well we were not going to watch this service anyway, we would just watch something else. We did not pay a cent for that cable bill, we are saving ourselves a good deal of money.|0
The Toxic Avenger, hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, whom is in cahoots with an evil corporation who just want the avenger gone to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less grim, much more comical tone, and a plot line that can't hold a candle to the original.|1
I watched this movie last night , i 'm a huge fan of the book , and i was pretty surprised i had never seen it before . It was a very intense , but entertaining movie that kept you riveted from beginning to end . I don't feel bad about being one of the two people who walked out of the theater. It was really hard to sit through, but i would recommend seeing it for the emotional and intellectual thrill of the story . There were a couple of things i did not expect from the book , but they were more surprising .|0
The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt {I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt tricked. They trot out about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate.|1
Adam Sandler 's movies are my favorite comedies . The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie . But I’m probably the only person to ever name the two movies I love the most as my favorite comedies. So, now you see where I’m going with this. Or maybe it’s not where I’m going with this. There is no way it’s this. It’s either this, or I can’t be this. It’s impossible to me, because I am exactly the same.|0
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. There are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? Not at all, is my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with a failure like this.|1
"Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said ""leave it alone."" Why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 ""Psycho,"" I don't know. My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialog was the same and the story the same.On one hand, I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film."|1

When HULK hit theaters in 2003 , it was n't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show started showing up, and not only did the series star Lou Ferrigno, but a new Hulk movie was announced for 2004 . With the success of the first movie in a new franchise and new characters like The Hulk and the Wasp on the screen, it would be natural for Marvel to go the whole hog and to bring out a second film. But as we know from the time when Spider-Man was first introduced in '63, this was not going to happen anytime soon.|0
I recently rented this promising mini series, I didn't even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.Forsyth deserves much, much better than this.|1
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante 's great work , distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, and destroys all credibility for anyone who claims to value the 's work of art . It seems that Dante has now gone off his rocker , and is just plain nuts to begin with. He must really be suffering from dementia . I am going to give you a hint , and suggest that you read some of the most recent work from this author . But first, I want to say to all of you about the genius and genius' of Dante 's work .|0
JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure Sam Nell ( The Dish ) , William Macy ( Happy Texas , Fargo ) and Mary Kay Place star. The latest entry in the hugely successful film series takes the characters we know and love back to the original movie for the ultimate all-new adventure, filled with action, adventure and humor. As the story opens we are taken back to the summer of 1983, a time when John Smith, an American journalist, and his wife Alice go to visit their family home on the Texas Gulf Coast. During this visit, their young son is taken away and never heard from again.|0
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that).|1
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar, where the company’s owner and his son both died in tragic automobile crashes on the road to Africa. The movie is set against the background of a revolution in Madagascar and the arrival of a new revolutionary leader. There is a happy ending of sorts and the movie ends with the character of an African saying “the world is what you make of it.” There’s some light comedy here but mostly it’s just an honest and somber look at death and the way that the world works.|0
I cant believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. Thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer Simpson making a movie about a doughnut!|1
"Sorry about that. But if you have seen this ""epic"", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but I do know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the Earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways."|1
"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(..in a running gag, anytime he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment."|1
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions.|1
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the U.S. and couldn't work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe.|1
"""Black Dragons"" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him."|1
I have never seen this in the theater , my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to my first one , there were no problems . for those who have never seen the movie (or don't like it) let me tell you that the movie is not a movie . it's more like a documentary . but the movie was not in the theaters in the beginning , so many people saw it without knowing its true nature until a year after the movie first came out , and then it was a success .|0
"1931 also presented ""an American tragedy"", the original tale of ""who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl"". this was a truly entertaining film. Babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. Monroe owsley, unmemorably played Babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing Crosby of ""the big broadcast"" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. Ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold."|1
"If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demise. ""Rififi"" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision."|1
The prior comments are way to generous . This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic . On the plus side however there is some good comedy in the movie and some good character development but this movie is a big disappointment . I have watched this movie more than once and every time I feel bad for the people involved in this movie and for what they have done. The movie is about a woman who was raped and then murdered. She had a daughter who is now an adult with her boyfriend and the man who committed the crime is now in prison.|0
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama 's brought upon us by Hollywood , this movie excels where others have failed to. It has everything one wants from a horror movie, especially in a setting that is ripe for the picking. If you enjoyed the first and third movies in this series, you will surely love this one, as it has everything one could want to find in a great horror movie. The plot of the film centers on a young boy, who is the son of two rich men.|0
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout?|1
Down Periscope is not a `` Great Movie '' . But then again very few flicks are . So if you have seen some of them , you would know that . The plot of this film is simple . The main character , Raju ( Jackie Shroff ) is a middle class guy who is a businessman and wants to take a vacation in his father's hometown . But then he hears that there is an old lady who is living alone and who is looking for him . She has been waiting for Raju since his father died . On that day , Raju goes to meet his father's house .|0
Philistines beware, especially American ones! This has all the elements you'll hate - a langorous approach to film language, a painterly sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well... If, however, you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of MTV/TV Commercials, then watch this.|1
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV . I own all 9 seasons on DVD and have never watched another sitcom that I find so laugh out-loud funny . The show's writers have done a terrific job at creating the most realistic and realistic looking characters to ever appear in a prime time sitcom . They have even created a cast who look and act as if they could really be any age or from any time . It's hard to explain just how realistic a sitcom this is but it really has become the benchmark for how great sitcoms should look .|0
This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. Yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm making out, but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.|1
"This movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science. There were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.People with expectations of seeing a ""pretty war"" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.War is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song."|1
this film was probably the best `` scary film '' i 've seen in years . chilling might be a milder word to apply . i thought the story was a nice twist to an otherwise mundane and dull film . in the film , which takes place in the year 1991 , our hero , rikki mordo ( jane michael) is a librarian at the local university library . she does a good job , helping students find the books they need and bringing in the books they need , but she always finds a few that the students just don't seem to find anywhere .|0
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product.|1
The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I 've seen in a long time -and I 'm not just talking about this film- was this one in this film festival I went to for the festival (that one I didn't watch, because I was tired), where there was a young woman sitting at an outdoor table. I had to sit down because I thought that I'm going to fall on my ass and hit my head. The woman had short hair with a ponytail, and was wearing a long black coat and some kind of cap over her head with a big white star on the front.|0
Why could n't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery 's men fighting the French instead of the Germans in the mountains? I don't know why the ending was changed to a German victory. They should have been fighting on the beaches of Normandy. If they would have made the movie differently, I wouldn't mind. I know, I know. But how can they not? They could have made a better movie. As it is, it is the perfect movie, a tribute to the Greatest Generation and the American military.|0
You know , I really hate IMDb 's censor system , since my entire review is almost gone if you use the censored version . It is annoying , especially since IMDb 's censor system makes it a lot harder to find out things about the movie , like what director, actor, writer and producer they used ( if they did at all ), or which directors and actors they used . In the censorship system itself , which IMDb uses , if you use both versions , then they will censor everything . In the end , it just looks like they censored .|0
"I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies I've ever seen. But the makers of ""Overnight"" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's Boondock Saints even about?"|1
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoke the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap.|1
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do . If you have n't seen Oldboy ( or the sympathy trilogy ) you can find it on Amazon or DVD in most of the video rental shops . It is rated as the best of the trilogy by various critics , it won best picture and best director and one of the best movies of the years and of course, it is probably the funniest. It is set in Korea during the Korean War which is the subject of so many other movies but Park's sense of humor has so much in common with them .|0
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot . I know , I know . I’m not even going to bother telling you why it is the best . Because that’s pretty much the way I feel about it. So to review, our heroes find themselves in a new town and they start out in a brand new school ( which I’m sure is a great start in itself ) . Unfortunately, that is not the only thing they are put to work for. They are tasked with the job of defending a town and its people from aliens.|0
"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing ( especially when they were all dancing and singing to that song)

This was my very first trip to Hollywood! I went in the spring of ’92 and rented it from Blockbuster. I saw the film again a week later, but only at home. We saw it again a month later when my mom and I took a family vacation to Orlando, FL. We saw it again the first weekend of our trip, but when we stopped in downtown Orlando we got to see it for only $0.00."|0
"This self-important, confusing b+w ""film"" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. There's no room for plot when you've got ""visceral imagery"" and ""subtle"" allegory. To me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades."|1
"This movie was pointless . I ca n't even call it sci-fi , since that requires more from a movie . The only science in it was that the people are all connected , but they don't do much with it. I can't even call it ""fantasy"" because there was nothing fantastical about it . Its not a bad movie , its just not really very good . 3.5 stars . A sci-fi movie about a group of scientists who are sent to the planet Mars to study life and how they can find a cure for their dying planet."|0
Do NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. It possibly is the worst movie I have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire.|1
Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) and Andy Kaufman. The other was filled with Jim Norton and Bill Maher. In one, Bronson would play a guy trying to play a woman. In one, he would be a man who would play a man who would play a man. Both were hilarious and I’ve watched both versions numerous times. But, I can only watch one. The first time around, The Comic Strip Presents was aired on ABC and ran for three seasons.|0
Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but lack Ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. When Mondo Burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like Good Burger is history, until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door.|1
Mel Welles , you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman 's Little Shop of Horrors , directs his first feature film , The Witches ( 1966 ). He was the film's producer, writer, editor, and star, who was able to put up the money to make his first feature. Welles worked with the director in many capacities, such as filming, editing, lighting, and cinematography, but his most important contribution to this film was the writing of the story . Welles would have a hand in the development and editing of this project, but he would be the star of the show.|0
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. Even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.Unlike most HK actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and a roll-call of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery.|1
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job.|1
Goldrush : A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages . The movie focuses around three young people who are having problems in school and family life. They decided to spend a winter in a tiny village on an island in Alaska for the purpose to live and figure out what their lives are about to do. They are all very close friends, and they can't get enough of each other. They also have a problem with an old friend who is moving back to Alaska. All three friends are searching for what they really are and what their real purpose in life is about to.|0

John Belushi died in 2004 at the age of 49. After the death of his wife Linda, they had four sons and two daughters. John Belushi was a talented actor who made it big in Hollywood. He was in some of the most popular TV shows in the country. He was also in many movies with his brothers, Tom and Bill.|0
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions.|1

I was so `` impressed '' with Tim Kincaid 's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try . . . and it is by far and away better than most . . . better in every way . . . . . I would recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining thriller or a decent spy novel. When you have a great author, you have to have great editors . . . and I am very happy to report that Kincaid . . . is the greatest editor that I have ever had the great fortune to work with . . . .|0
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt like it was about one hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie.|1
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. There never is the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years of age. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie.|1
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . Even the most patient audience members are likely to expect that the film will follow a coherent plot line. A good film will offer a satisfying narrative. A good movie will offer an engaging story to its audience. An engaging story doesn't need a plot or a climax, but it must tell a good story, one worth telling to the audience. The best films are the ones that don't require too much effort from the audience.|0
Pete 's Meteor . I seen this referred to as `` authentic '' and a `` gem . '' I know it's authentic from a personal standpoint. It's not my first choice for a piece of jewelry but it's unique and a great piece for any lady to have! I'm glad you liked it, I love the look on the back! If I had to describe how I felt when I bought my gem, it was a mix of joy and relief. The gem itself is so beautiful in person that it's hard to explain but it's just a beautiful, unique piece of work!|0
`` De Dominee '' is based on the life of a real dutch gangster , Klaas Bruinsma ! In the movie , he is portrayed by Jan de Hoog , and his gangster career begins in Holland with him as a member of the criminal organization 'De Koning'. In the beginning , he is just a simple thief , stealing money , drugs and jewelry from the rich for his gangster friends . In order to get the money , he needs to steal the jewels from a bank vault , which leads to a big problem for him.|0
Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on.|1
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off, the set-up is very predictable and I love how it is filmed. I think that they used a lot of the camera to make it seem as if we were there at the set, and it really added to the film. It also got me really interested in the movie and I loved it! I think it could have been better and I enjoyed it but I do agree with some of the criticism it has. I can't explain why but I think the characters were pretty weak.|0
As far as fake documentaries go ( fakumentaries anyone ? ) , this one is up there with the best of them. Not only does it contain priceless interviews of some of the world’s leading scientists but it also is one of the very few that contains footage and photos from some of the biggest and best secret space programs and programs that may never be publicly acknowledged. You’re about to embark on a journey of discovery that you may never, ever forget and it will be the trip of a lifetime!|0
Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror , science fiction and suspense films from the 90’s . We all know what they say about nostalgia , and there is a whole lot to be said about that. The first 30 minutes are enough for most horror fans to leave the movie. There’s so much to love in this movie . It gives you what it promised and delivers what it promised. I was so impressed by it when I first watched it and I was not disappointed . I have to say I was really disappointed when they cut the movie .|0
"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about ""cold spots"" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (""it's getting cold!"") Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary."|1
You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).The story is really touching and hats off to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different.The relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.|1
This movie was a disappointment . The story is essentially The Shining with a castle ( or a very cheap replica castle ). There's no mystery about what happened, and you don't really want to know anyway . The characters aren't believable . The performances by the leads aren't really that good. I've seen so much worse . Some people like the movie because it's a little edgy. If you like the movie, don't go and don't let me stop you. I just don't think it was worth the time . What's with the title?|0
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at Eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, I see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society.|1
An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants . At the same time, it's as if the director John Huston was trying to prove that he's an equal to Alfred Hitchcock by casting him in the lead role . It doesn't happen very well . And yet, it does, as the film has an almost hypnotic ability to grab your attention and then leave you with your own questions . . . and a few ideas . . . and some questions of your own . . .|0
"Watched this film with an audience of .... 5 in total ! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ...
but the audience voted for Lakshya. This film was very good but I don't think I would be willing to give it more than three stars ... If you're not sure how to rate films, here's my simple system to judge the worthiness of these films that you've watched. The idea is to take the number of stars given to each film and then multiply by three ... so that the result gives you an average rating for that film. So here goes."|0
My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this should be good ol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all.|1
"Kazuo Komizu strikes again with ""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman"", the sequel to ""Entrails of a Virgin"". This time around the story is based around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take on the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped-up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day. When she gets over her head and the Yakuza capture her, she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery. It apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine."|1
"Man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh#t. I read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself........ Ah this seems like a half decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No,no,no way f*cking wrong. Jesus, if only I could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film, I would be happy. The lead actor had THE whiniest, gayest voice ever.Man!It really was bad....""Amandaaaaaaaa...."",""I gotta save my girlfriend...."" F*ck off!"|1
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious , it does an amazing job showing what is going wrong and what is right with the world. A brilliant piece of cinema , with no pretensions whatsoever and a great ending. A real eye opener and should be watched by everyone. It was a great movie, I really liked all of the characters. I don't know why but I didn't mind the ending as much as others seem to have said, I found it interesting and emotional. I have a question though.|0
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park. It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free.|1
Too much stock footage ( almost one third of this 53 minute film ) really slows this one down . I was hoping for a film about a family of four that just happen to live next door. I would have paid $5 or $6 each for a ticket to this film and I would pay double now. I saw it in a drive in. I saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse when I was at the Denver Film Festival. In both of those venues it was better than expected and worth the price of admission. I really hope the next one is better.|0
"Normally I am a typical ""creepy-crawly-hatin'"" girl, but after watching this film (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc. ), and how a plucky young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Honey."|1

Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema , and it 's way better than I expected . I 'll give you some quick background info about the film , and what I thought when I first watched it . Then you'll hear how I thought about the film while it was in editing , and why I thought the film had an interesting story (and it did) . Then I tell you why I think the director is a genius of a writer (and he is - his story is interesting, I think , but what's more important is the film he makes ).|0
` Rock star ' is not on its way to any ` stairway to heaven ' category as one of the greatest rock and roll stars of all time. But there's a reason he's not. At the very least, it's a great song to play in your backyard. Here's a look at four reasons why you should give it a listen right now.1. The opening guitar riff is among the most infectious rock songs ever created. It's as simple as it sounds, and it gives the song a feeling that's even simpler.|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie. I thought that since I'm young and it was made so long ago I wouldn't like it all that good, but after I saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it to liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco was treated during the Early 1900's, by the Germans, French, and even the Americans.|1
Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero ( Bond ) and villain ( Blofeld ) were the most boring and stupid characters I have come across in my life. At one point I thought they were going to make a film with Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks doing a two man Bond film. If only Bond was actually a spy I could have liked it. Instead it’s an action film with only one scene of actual action. At least with the Bond films we get some character development from Bond and we find out his personal life.|0

I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease.|1
"If ( as I just pointed out in THE GOAT ) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding an excuse for himself and his comic-book family to make a statement about what's happening in his comics, a tradition that has been going on since the mid-1950s. I believe he's doing it now to get back at Marvel for having made him and his comic a target of ridicule. I believe he's saying that he's ""got a family to take care of"", and ""that's what family is for, right?"""|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. Luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. A hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house.|1
Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport.|1
This film is bad . Not so bad it is good . Just bad . It is however hilariously bad . It’s like the worst comedy I have seen all year. You can’t believe how badly this film is going to ruin the comedy genre. I will give you three good reasons why you might not want to watch this film . So I guess it’s up to you to decide if you will watch this film . The First Reason why you might want to Watch This film is that it’s so amazingly bad .|0
"I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, ""Ben Johnson?!"" - he was a goddam MOVIE STAR guys, a COWBOY, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for TV disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. So there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm."|1
"I rented this type of ""soft core"" before, but I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as ""Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die""--which was both sexy AND funny. It had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason why I didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the ""Must be 18 to Rent"" Sticker. I was looking for more ""cheese"" and less ""cheesecake."|1
Terror in the Jungle is a real find . If you saw it , you 're one of the few who will appreciate it as a movie. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg , from his own notes and interviews with the survivors of the massacre in Cambodia during the early 1970s. He has written the screenplay . It is one of the most intense films I have seen in a long time, and I can fully understand why it became a classic. It tells a story that is very important for our own history.|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb, Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller.|1
"Don't get me wrong. I've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to ""Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys"" sticks a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun, ""Head Of The Family"" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W."|1
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. For something made by an eighteen year old film student, I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti stick to the documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around Portland writing graffitti. He is joined by another and they skate around together creating art.|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . The acting is pretty bad , but the acting is what matters . I think I will skip this because it was rushed . The only reason I see it as good is cause I saw it with friends . I watched it last night with a friend and I didn't think I liked it at all until we came to the part with the girl getting gang raped. I don't know what I thought the movie would be when I started watching it.|0
Sometimes it 's hard to be a pirate ............... but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun with it. The first time I saw her performance was a year ago in Sydney, when she appeared at the Town Hall Theatre at the National Gallery. Then I had a taste of how much fun she could be. The following year, she was at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour. The following year, she was again in the Sydney Opera House as part of a UK tour. And the following year, she came to Canberra for the Canberra Book Festival.|0
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also gross but not like this). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. The film makes this plan look that easy. I guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person.|1
This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long . There was an aspect of film-noir contained in it that I have not seen before in any film . I would give it 5 stars if I could . It is also a story I am interested in seeing told from a different point of view. The movie starts with a story of two men in love and they are trying to get back together again. This is something I feel a lot of women do. However this couple has two children who are almost grown and have moved out from home.|0
This is one of those movies where the acting , set location , direction , and effects were so bad , the whole thing was not worth watching for the acting or the effects , but if you are really looking for an action movie then do watch it , this is just a great movie with great action , great music , great cast , great effects , and just a beautiful and great film . If you enjoyed it , please remember to leave us a review and tell everyone what you thought about it . You can also subscribe and follow us on social media for new and fresh content .|0
"I completely understand WHY this movie was made . Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome, violent masterpiece that went against everything that was going on in society at that time. It was about a girl who was abused by her father. Her boyfriend killed her - he killed her family as well. I wanted to watch this movie as a teenager. In my teen years we were obsessed with the Twilight series and we thought it was just the ""coolest"" series EVER! The main character Edward Cullen, was the ""good"" one and Bella was the ""bad"" one."|0
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England. It is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'Technical Aspects' of the IMDb site.|1
We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. I've seen that Junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID! !|1

One of my desires is to be a film-maker , and I just have to say there 's no way I'll get to it until I get a real job , which I have no intention of doing. But that doesn't seem to stop many people I know, so I want to know what do you do? And if you're lucky enough to make it through to the other side of life, what did you learn? And what keeps you going?I think the answer is as simple as the question.|0
"A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence . Rob Bowman 's direction is brilliant . . . and he has never been short of interesting stories. ""What do we do?"" ""Find the guy who wrote that piece of filth and make him do what you want."" He looked at me. I looked at him. And we both knew we'd both get what we wanted if we just did what they wanted us to do. He went on. ""You know how they operate."|0
Okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *SPOILER ALERT* The film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is so very.) Now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough.|1
The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.The movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town.|1
Thank God I have fast-forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Whatever: It's a stupid cliché. It doesn't make any difference. There's this guy, javier Bardem, who constructs buildings or something. It doesn't matter. He is handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there is a car wreck but I watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? Car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me.|1
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is.|1
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it 's even the worst movie i've seen this year. I can't say it better but this is just one of the reasons why it was one of the best movie ever i've seen. It is so different and funny. This is just a movie i really love. I really love it. i love it. This was one of the best movies of 2016. It's a movie i really love it. One of the best movie of 2016.|0
"Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: ""go to hell."" thanks. it had to be said!"|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I 'd be able to relate to this film perfectly . Its got all the elements of a good story, including good drama, good acting and excellent cinematography, but it is just that, and that is what makes the film. The characters are pretty flat, I can't even begin to describe how I feel about them, they are so unoriginal and boring to the point that it is annoying. The characters are so boring that I had to watch it over and over again just for the pleasure of hating them.|0
"The prey has an interesting history , unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984."" ""June?"" ""We're not going to get to the truth in time to stop a disaster."" ""And if we don't get it now, what good are we when we do get home?"" ""We have no idea what that may be."" ""There may be a whole army on the loose, and you might not have a clue where to look."" ""How can you be so callous?"""|0
"This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made . Following are the plus points of this movie-

First of all this movie is totally different from any other Hindi film . The script writer and director are new entrants in the Tamil film world. Second of all the film is an attempt to present Indian society through an authentic lens which is not seen in other Indian movies . This is what the film is really all about . Third of all this film is a movie that will not let you leave the cinema until the end ."|0
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager . I grew up with the Sesame Street characters , but I was not really into it. When I saw this movie, I was in awe. The characters are very human. They are people just like you and I. There is nothing fake about them, and they really care about each of their fans. The plot was simple , but very touching. When I saw that it was based on a true story , I also was amazed.|0
A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy,the sensible elder brother.|1
Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.|1
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought 'I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place.|1
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself ... Am I the only one that thinks it's just ... Well, it's a little silly, maybe a little over-the-top, but I just can't put it down. This film was so funny to me, for me, the only way to describe it is ... It just made me smile like crazy. The story line is simple, and that's what I love about the movie. It's not like any movie out there. It's more of a cartoon, a farce, a short story.|0
I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest , this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife team Robert Downey Jr and J. D. Roth have produced an excellent comedy. It's a film with three distinct stories: a man who has lost his family in an automobile accident and lives with his mother and her dog; his wife who is forced into marriage and a young man who is about to become a mother when she's killed in a car accident. There's a tragic sense of loss that's all too evident in these characters.|0
First, and foremost, I take issue to the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they are referring is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but I assure you, it is singular in Spanish.Next, I thought this movie had been done years ago. It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been kind of scary.Let's talk about the special effects.|1
"Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film ""experts."" it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he has done."|1
"Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it to the guy. In my eyes, he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.Thirst is, essentially, a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the ""rules"" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with."|1
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies , and a third one is being filmed. In celebration of the 25th anniversary, we're doing a series of interviews with anime and manga creators. For the first, we caught up with Yūji Okada, the creator of one of my favourite characters of all time, Naruto Uzumaki. How did you first enter the Naruto fandom, and why did you get involved with the series in the first place? Yōji Okada: In the summer of 2006, I was in Tokyo, doing some freelance work.|0
If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman dumps Ripe on us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is this?|1
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I 've ever seen . Very little of Segal , himself, is visible in this film . It could be considered as a tribute to him , as the film features mostly non-actors . I found the film one of the most unique of its kind in recent times . With this film , it seems like Segal has put out a statement that he is not done making films . He is now a film director with more passion , passion and ambition than ever before . This is an interesting look at the state of the nation and the political system .|0
That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks.|1
"I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan . I figured it could n't be that bad . It was actually pretty good . It had a couple of plot holes , but most of the things that were supposed to happen just didnt . The characters were all well done . It did have its flaws but I don't see why it is considered a terrible movie . If I had to compare this film to another I would say ""A Walk to Remember "" , but the only similarity is that they both were made in 1988 . There was never a sequel to either one ."|0

I don't know about you but it is time to get out and get dirty again. It's time to start something different. Something a little more exciting. Something more creative. This is going to be different. And we are going to keep it up. For as long as it takes. For the rest of your life."|0
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. Half the scenes are pointless. There is not an inkling of character development. The score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie yet I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances.|1
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie . This was a better story than the rest of the film but had one of the worst endings I've ever seen. And I have seen quite a few films that have terrible endings. This just left me wanting to see the rest of the films I've missed. Also the ending of the movie was just a huge let down for the movie and was so predictable that it ruined the ending and really left me wanting more .|0
I like Arnold , and I love the subject matter , but this was a very disappointing movie . When I was a teenager , and had just started to read the works of H. P. Lovecraft and of course there were many books by Lovecraft and I had started reading them with my father and brother as well . The reason for that was because they all started to read them when I was 8 or 9 years old . My father would take us into the attic and we would read them . When I read them , I would get to know them better .|0
"This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. Isn't there something a little hypocritical there? The scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite."|1
Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was horrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it is a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrible.|1
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination, dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now playing at select theaters near you. Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look away.For rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.|1

Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.The first one, which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic.|1
"I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan . If you have not seen a Cronenberg film I think you should. He puts a smile on your face every time he steps out of the shadows . Friday, January 20, 2013

This is my favorite quote from the movie . I don't know about the rest of ya, but I don't like to be made to feel that way by a movie . I would rather be given a happy ending and have to come up with my own story about what happened."|0
So many of us who are devoted to the `` art '' of the motion picture will disregard or forget that the great art of the film is the one thing that really matters. It has no `` market value ' '' - not the way an ordinary book or magazine would be `` sold out ' '. There is nothing in the movie except the art. If the art is good, the movie is better, but there are some pictures that are really great because they are full of life and meaning. The great movies are so full of life and meaning they have a quality of their own.|0
Dreadful . I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this . I don't even understand all this. But I want to warn you because if you read this book you will have to deal with horrible things. It's a horror story . You can get away with this if you keep reading. But if you don't then I can't do anything to save you. That's if you can stomach what's in here . I'm not an occultist . But when I read this book I felt compelled to warn everyone I know .|0
Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic `` Godfather '' and yet another case of over-hype due to being too big and overstating its potential. A very simple story with a very simple plot. It has everything one needs in the way of a good plot to make the viewer appreciate a good story. The story is very simple. It's a love story between a rich man and a poor man. The rich man dies in a gangland fight and leaves his rich wife for the widow of the poor man who died in a gangland fight.|0
"Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic ""writing"" sure will.A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. Need I say more? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special."|1
I just saw this movie tonight . Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman. In her role she did something that I never seen anyone do on film before . I will say it was one of the best roles of the year but for me that's not saying a lot . The acting is great and I can't think of anything wrong with this movie because it was well directed , well written . The plot is decent and the plot twists and turns you don't really see coming .|0
Worst movie ever seen . Worst acting too . I can not imagine a movie worse then this . Nothing was funny at all . . . . . this movie has to be watched . This is so bad . I can not put this on the movie charts . It is too bad that you can not see the movie with out subtitles . I will buy a DVD of this. This review is of a movie that I saw at a movie theater. The movie has been on TV for a long time, but I have not had the opportunity to check the original movie.|0
This movie was obviously made with a very low budget , but did they have to make it so obvious that everything was a metaphor and nothing was a literal statement . when you can't have a movie without a metaphor , you have to make one . you have to make one because there is no other way to make that movie . you also have to make one to make that movie , and that's the case here . because the first half of this movie is all metaphors . there is no reason to make it so obvious at the beginning .|0
"Just awful. It's almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plodding, passionless mishmash could result. But that's television for you -- filler between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the period re-creation, which screams ""1928"" in banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and waistcoats, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) -- with all the attention paid to pointless, arty detail, the important matters get ignored.Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or competent writing and acting."|1
Well, this is new...Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called...Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films.|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. If you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. Its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.Also I was wondering, where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, It went pretty good.|1
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake.|1
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi , but this movie is just not good . The movie starts off good, but it’s after 10 minutes I start getting very bored and annoyed , with all of the people just walking about talking, talking and walking , I am very tired of this movie by the end of the film . I did not even watch the whole movie , but the best thing about it was the sound design . I can’t believe how bad the director’s cut is ( I had a copy of it in the library and decided to read it) .|0
I was very disappointed in this film. The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way.|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines . One exception for this is the one film that I always watch in theaters and never watched at home - DDLJ. There are not many Hindi movies worth watching nowadays. But DDLJ always stands out. There was one film in my life, in which the director took a new way of writing, and made an amazing film. DLJ has a very unique way of writing, and the story is just amazing. It also has one of the best romance stories in the world in the form of a love triangle.|0
Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M . It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously .... Scott is a guy with a troubled past and he has to get a new life by any means possible.His ex is an evil bitch with the body and the face of an angel.She wants Scott dead.She's going to kill him.Scott has to do it for the good of everyone. He doesn't have long to go on this quest to find himself before he has to make a decision. I loved the journey, it was like an adventure in time.|0
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage, I have stumbled across this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. Its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right. I was in love immediately. Then, a funny thing happened about the second time around. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie.Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That's very commendable.|1
What a self-indulgent mess ! Duncan Roy 's film is apparently autobiographical , however it 's impossible to find any evidence that Roy 's parents ever existed, or that Roy was born anywhere other than the Australian Outback , where his father, Robert Roy, was a rancher who became a police officer during the 1950s. It is not known whether Roy was raised in either of the towns where his parents lived , although he claimed to be an only child. The only other reference to his father is his birth record from the Western Australia Births Register Office , which reveals he is registered as Robert James Roy .|0
I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience!|1
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or being paid to do it. But the fact that you're looking at an image of yourself, wearing a suit that has not been tailored to suit you, is almost certainly the reason why you've come here. And this is exactly why. In this picture, you’re looking into the mirror, looking like you, the person you think you are. You probably think you look pretty good too.|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy.|1
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen ""Dahmer"" (2002) I can say that following what the media put out about Jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. I have studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood."|1
"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just a look at his new film, ""Everything is Illuminated"", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector."|1
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 `` Musical Thriller, `` `` West Side Story. ``

Sondheim is best remembered for being one of the great theatrical composers, but he was also an astute business man, and he brought these two sides of his brain to bear on his art. He was the greatest of Broadway directors when he took over the musical of ``West Side Story,'' and he was an astute business manager, always trying to maximize his own profit."|0
Well well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it by all ways. It's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA. So copies disappeared into the underground scene. All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. So it made this flick unique.|1
Steven Segal has done some awful films , but this is probably one of the best since his career took off. It’s a simple little story about an American man who moves to an Israeli settlement in Judea to try to get to know his mother who has been taken by Israeli soldiers to a Palestinian village where they were abused and beaten. Segal made the movie in Israel, so it is a little bizarre to find out that, for years, the IDF had the film under strict watch on the battlefield.|0
This movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. I find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.This movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.There is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. There is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten.|1
"i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. It was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom ""hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid"".Um. Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! It is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then."|1
The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by.|1
Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town. The audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director. Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7, I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!|1
Amazing , amazing , amazing . What more can be said ? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage of our theater. This is the only production I have seen in years that I will be able to look back and say that I sat down, paid attention, felt that I was involved and was so impressed that I bought the book at the end. It was worth it ! Thank you , my dear friend , for all the love and care you have for us . This is my favorite production.|0
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle.|1
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! i waste my time watching it and after few minutes of watching it i just turn the tv off without watching the rest of the movie . this was really bad i don`t know what to do with this movie . this movie will never be watched . i give it 2.5 out of 5 stars . When I see the trailer for this movie, I get excited to see this movie because it’s very similar with “Hercules”.|0
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate.|1
A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets , created by Jim Henson & Co , have been made , but have never seen release . There’s always been a desire to bring them to the screen, and we’ve been very lucky to get this opportunity now , with the release of Sesame Street: The Muppets – The Muppets , which comes as part of Sesame Street on DVD & Blu-Ray . The film stars Henson himself as Bert, Elmo , Cookie Monster , Rowlf and Kermit the Frog among others. But the biggest star of the film, and its big reason for coming to DVD is Elmo.|0
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha. Too many diversions from the actual history. Terrible terrible subtitle!!! I wonder where and who did that subtitle. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was soooo bad! Described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. Honestly, I'm wondering if the film critics of Academy award is that lenient or what?|1
This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil' Pimp must lay down for his homies.The animation isn't very good in this.|1
"For the record , I hate spoof movies . Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE ! because those are classics , but even they suck . But I don't get why people love to laugh at themselves . And in the end , they should just be ashamed of what they are like . _________________“I told my mom I was going to Disneyworld on my birthday. I just said, 'Please take me to Disneyworld on my birthday.’""

Silly thing . I have to do a double-take at that one . But the funny thing is , all the time , I feel like laughing at my self ."|0
Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - there is nothing for the moviegoer to enjoy , but then it all comes tumbling forth with the second half . what makes the movie worth watching is that it is actually entertaining . when , at the very outset , you are told that the movie will show you something , you're not really sure of what that something is . but once you get up to speed on it , you realize that , indeed , the film has something to offer .|0
Think 'Charmed ' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture . A very sexy and fun way to get over a little hump you are going through right now. I think we all get over a little hump right now. We have all had a time when we really needed a little break from something, be it sex or work. You might be ready to give it up, maybe you are already over it but you know you are not over it and you want a change.|0
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life . A woman `` The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ''(Lara Croft) falls in love with a young man who wants to become a millionaire. It is based on the real life of author V. S. Stavrova

I have been following this film from the first scene. I am still not happy with how it ended. I would like to see another film on this subject. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo

I was going to watch this with my friend, and after we both had seen it we were talking about it together."|0
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS , and all my friends and I thought it was awesome, but then we grew up and watched it on cable. I saw the sequel when it was on HBO and thought it was better and that was when I decided that I needed to write a book on it! I also think it is a really beautiful film. It is a work of art but also has a heart. It is not really about politics, but about relationships and the love we all hold for our families.|0
* * * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * * * * I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate, especially since I was asked to do a feature about the movie in this month's Hollywood Magazine. I was pretty nervous, too. I'd only seen the film once, when it played as part of my university's cinema program. I'd never seen anything that looked like it. And, to be frank, I didn't think it was going to do well at the box office. Still, I was curious, and had to see what all the buzz was about.|0
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. The leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. So, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to Iraq war and Black Water Company.What a load of leftest excrement!|1
I wo n't spoil it for you . Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled ( you don't read my blog anyway ) I hope you enjoyed the post and will come back next week to read another great story. Thanks for the visit. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter stories and the movie adaptations. It is also the case that, while I am not the biggest fan, I always look forward to new books. And what a treat, I have just read a brand new one by Robin McKinley and I absolutely loved it.|0
Televised in 1982 , from a Los Angeles production , this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage production in the history of the National Theater Company. “It is an impressive production,” observed a Times critic of the first evening. “When you see the opening scene you will not be able to deny that it is more than theatrical, for it is so alive, so realistic, that one forgets that the actor on the stage is just a part. It is as if he and the audience were the same person, and the actress and the audience are one another.|0
The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. He does -- I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments I found amusing -- Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions laid on productions by the Hays Code.|1
( This is a review of the later English release by Disney , featuring Alison Lohman , Patrick Stewart , and Ron Perlman . ) Hollywood was the place to be for young men and young women in the 1960s, but for the children, it wasn’t. In the UK, the children’s TV channel Play School was the primary source of television viewing for children and teenagers in the 1950s and 1960s, with their first program being broadcast on 15 September 1956. In 1962 the BBC launched its own television channel, Playfair, to cater for younger children.|0
This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem.|1
"The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled ""Our Family Trouble."" To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line."|1
"In terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, taking the side of ""the people"" against ""the nobles."" This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war."|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2!!!). I could find nothing to redeem this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor but I doubt that's why shes there.The dialogue is truly appalling.|1
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have turned off the whole thing. I thought it was awful and I hope no one has to go through this horrible thing I went through. I feel like if I don't write this review right now my stomach will be in my throat. I am so incredibly angry that a woman would have to endure something like this. I think that it would be best that she doesn't read this because I don't think I could even express how angry I am.|0
What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs.|1
The Calu-what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name as well. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. Starting off with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well I can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. Poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever.|1
This movie took me by surprise . I first saw it more than 10 years ago , and it stays in my head as a favorite film ever . The music was great . I have never watched an animated film more than 3 times in my life but this one got a standing ovation after I finished it . I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have some fun with their kids and a great way to introduce animation to the whole family . If you are interested in a similar movie that was made in Russia and I am not sure it was ever shown in US I suggest you give it a try .|0
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival ? I understand it got into the Panorama section ,but why is it here ? And why in Berlin ? I am not from Berlin and I didn’t notice it ,so it got in the Panorama Section . I have no idea why ,but I suppose the movie didn’t make a big impression with critics or audience in Germany .I can imagine why,because the movie was not a commercial success and I guess it got no good reviews . Could you kindly explain it ? Is it a new movie ?|0
Christopher Nolan 's directorial debut is a memorable one . The film was very well received and help land contracts with a host of big-budget films . The film has been described as a psychological horror film that is also a thriller . The film has also been seen as a psychological thriller. What is your take on The Dark Knight trilogy? I'm going to be honest with you , my take on this series has always been the same -- it's a pretty good movie, but not one that stands out for me from the crowd.|0
I never fell asleep during a movie . Never . This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of their technology , I have never once seen anyone use his technology to make me fall asleep and I have been watching TV and movies all my life.This movie was so awesome it made me laugh while I was falling asleep. I loved it and can not wait until it comes out on DVD. This movie is a must see! The story and the acting is great. The acting is so real it's a little creepy.|0
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review . unfortunately , both times i was told to stop doing that . after i moved , i asked what my rights were . was told that i had to wait and see what the court decided . i did not want to wait , so i filed a counter suit . well , in the end, it was determined that i was right and they were wrong . now , i just have to pay for my damages . i will do so and try and make it right .|0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played it with more conviction than he does, that is, of course, the problem. If you’re a big Myers fan like I am, you’re in for an intense, fast-paced and highly entertaining ride. But, if you’re an “I hate him because…” kind of person, you won’t find anything of note to like. I’ve given up trying to understand why anyone would be against this film.|0
You know the old saw about a train wreck ? The one about how you ca n't look away ? Well I guess you can , cause I'm about to watch one ! I have a hunch that some of y'all have a lot of money in your pocket , and I would like to take a little from it. I'm going to start by saying that this train wreck is coming to a town near you. You can either join me , or ignore me, and I really don't care a hoot one way or the other.|0
"I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say ""Like Pelswick"" and go on with what ever he was originally doing."|1
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star, and the Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American Version and a few European Versions, they end half way through Fist of the North Star which is about as far as the movie goes.The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short.|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters . Steven ( Andy Freeman ) and Maggie ( Emily Alyn Lind ) are the kind of couple who love one another and who want to grow old together. Their lives are perfect . Until, that is, their marriage is turned upside down when Steven's father, Ben ( John Carroll Lynch ) is arrested for child sexual abuse. Maggie has to decide what to do with the evidence against her husband . On the surface, the film looks like an adult-oriented action flick in the vein of films such as the Bourne films and Die Hard .|0
Though it 's a Christmas movie , `` Christmas in Connecticut '' could have been done any time of year - but not so far in advance. In this case, you'll get only the first week of November, the last week of November, and the weekend before Christmas . But you'll have a better chance of seeing `` Christmas in Connecticut '' this year. The film won 't open in theaters for at least a month. The film is about a man who, after a long period of silence, goes back to a family he abandoned when he was young.|0
"I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the ""McHales Navy"" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too."|1
Watching the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody, but I'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that), and I can assure you it's not worth watching. It's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte.|1
"Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever for leaving. The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming ""Exterminate"" then)."|1
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled Haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best.|1
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class. And some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. AND FAILED.That is my only explanation for this, this, thing. Good God they left the date and time counter on during some of it. The picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot.|1
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about the most amazing movie I have ever seen. It made me feel all the feels and I’m sure it did the same for most of the people that were in there. I loved the script and the acting and it made me feel so sad for these people and I just wanted to hug every one of those characters. There was a lot of sadness in it but I think I liked that it wasn’t over the top.|0
"What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn ` t up to much when they got here ? I believe we have a number of brilliant mathematicians, such as, for example, the following:

Friedrich Reinhold, who was a teacher of mathematics at Oxford. Fermat. Albert Einstein

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz

Leonhard Euler

Euler was born on the 19th May 1707. He spent a lot of time working on what we now know as algebraic geometry. At this time, he was very much involved in the research of algebraic geometry."|0
This is a tough film to review , since several factors need to be taken into account . Let 's take a look . We all remember the ending of the original film. We all remember how well it worked . In fact , we all saw it , when we were little kids , and it's still one of those movies that sticks in our memory . So , with that said , I will try to make it clear how I would like to see this new film , if at all , it can be seen on the screen .|0
I ca n't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess ! The plot ( and I use that term loosely) is so far off the rails it would be funny if you couldn't see it! If you ever watch old reruns of Star Trek where they play a movie with a similar plot ( but far better ) I think you'll get the hint. Anyway I wanted to comment about a couple of things and let you know if you're interested in something or not! 1. So what's the deal with all of this and how does this relate to the draft?|0
I'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but I'm sorry, this film is awful. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least that many clichés. It's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. And his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style.|1
"Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or ""artsy fartsy"" as some people would say. I assure you, that after one viewing, ""Bobbycrush"" will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film."|1
OK , well , no one in their right mind ( s ) would pick up a movie titled ``Jaws`` , but it has its fans. I have to admit the movie did not scare me, but there was an odd moment with a woman and her husband on a boat. I was sitting right beside them, and the woman was leaning over her husband and I could see his face. So what was that about, I thought . The husband asked her why she was so scared . She said that was her husband.|0
Like all of the very earliest films , this `` movie '' is very , very short -- lasting about 15 minutes and less. But that isn't by chance. In fact, the very first reel is the longest of them all, because the filmmakers were planning to use it for something else. The idea was to use it for a short documentary . So when the film starts, we're only 3 minutes in. And then -- it's over in 5 minutes! We only get 2 minutes into it, too, before it cuts to the first scene in the very first shot.|0
I used to think that it could n't get worse that `` Army of the Dead '' but this load of garbage is just an extension of it. If I recall correctly the Army of the Dead games were on some of the better games in the last generation of the NES. This is pure garbage and should never have been allowed on a game that should have never been allowed on a NES system. It is a shame they didn't make this a remake of a game that would have been very well received.|0
"What an awful movie . Full of cliches , perplexing scenes , very bad acting , and an atrotious script . This movie is not for anyone , and not for adults . I think you can safely say no one will be able to enjoy . I was very angry , and had to hide in the bathroom because I thought I might kill myself . You can not imagine how angry I am , and how hurt and disappointed I feel . What a disappointment . What a terrible movie. I thought I was the only one who actually enjoyed ""The Room""."|0
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco's powerful message. The film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people.|1
"Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book ""Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman"", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married!"|1
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas, the roistering, free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries.|1
"I love this movie . It is the first film Master P have ever done . It is based on a song ""Let's Talk About Love"" , and the movie is about what happens when he meets the love of his life . The film is about Master P & his gang , and the film has a very good plot and script . It is funny , the film is well made and Master P is a cool rapper . But the movie did have some flaws . First and foremost , it should have had the original beat for the song ."|0
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it is their second collaboration, the other being Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 1937. The film also featured the last appearance by Stanwyck as a screen performer and the only one on the list not included in the top 20. Fonda had made a couple of films before with Stanwyck but the two had never made a film together. The couple made their first on-screen pairing in 1926’s They Live By Night and their second collaboration in 1929’s This Property Is Treasured.|0
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style.|1
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics , and is a must see for all psychotronic fans . There is not a bad person in this movie who does not have their own story that has been hidden inside of this film . I think I will be the only person in the world that believes the story to be true and the events that unfolded to be actually true . The fact of the matter is , the events in this movie have all been documented and have been reported in countless books and websites . It is very easy to make a movie like this .|0
"I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie . There 's a lot of action and it 's a must see movie . I will definitely see the movie in a theater again and it was really fun . I would recommend this movie to all my friends

This was a very enjoyable movie and I recommend it to any fan of action flicks. However, for a movie to truly live up to the hype of it's hype it would need to be more than just a good action movie. That's what I'm expecting to come out on the other end..."|0
"...I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told ""we need at least 90 minutes"", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. Music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score I've ever heard."|1
This film did not excite me. While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.One thing that I did not quite follow is how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.The other thing that I did not particularly like was the missing segment of Khan's life. It did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long.|1
I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But perhaps that was because I never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, I have to say it was no way better than number 5. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects.|1
I would like to know if `` The Outsiders '' ( Australian TV series ) will ever be released on DVD or Blu-ray and how many episodes have been shot. No. It's not possible. There are too many episodes. I know you can get them on DVD in Australia and I'm sure you could on the Blu-ray in the US. They'd probably go for that price though. But you could also try getting them online through the Australian DVD Forum, there's a few that have them, but they haven't been for years, I would think.|0
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Modern love...thats for sure. In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants.|1
If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Do n't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a cheesesteak,but that's the only place i would be eating one. i've never been to Texas, but I've lived in Austin for about 8 years now. I was born there, raised there and i love it. I love all of the music, the food, the friends, the people, the nature and the history of this beautiful little city. I love it to death. Austin is my home.|0
I kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way or another , but it didn't and I still don't think I ever saw it. However it is now a part of my life and I hope to revisit it sometime in my future , but I think this is an excellent place to start my search. This is a wonderful film on many levels but for me, it is a love story. There are several things about this movie that I find so moving and so powerful.|0
The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this! In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the populace that whoever messes with Chuck or his people have to pay the piper. This one is no fun.|1
Two actors play rival gangsters in three films , the final of which is a sci-fi film , that nods to the past, but takes place in the future, where crime is now a global, technological problem. They have a long-term relationship (the first film was his first in 15 years), and one of the films is based on a book he has written. They both live in the same country (they met there), and he also lived there for three years until he got out and went to college (the first film took place in Italy).|0
"During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: ""Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? ""So, my comprehension of this movie, was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it.These are the things I found in ""Four shades of brown"". In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:1."|1
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film . Initially , I was struck by the cinematography and the lighting. The first viewings were great, but the second set left me a bit underwhelmed and disappointed. Now , I have re-viewed the film , and I find it stunning . It's got an amazing script , an amazing cast and an amazing performance by Tom Hardy. I found myself completely enthralled and in awe as I watched the film . I felt that it would be impossible for me not to laugh or to cry.|0
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying something. There is a scene where the soldier is on the front lines of battle. He gets shot at and is about to be killed. He sees one of the other soldiers take aim and fires back at the target but hits an innocent bystander. The soldier takes a second to think and takes out his own life with a second shot for the same result. This movie is like watching the events play out in slow motion. What really scares me about the Vietnam war movies.|0
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys ( Fong and Roundtree ) pitted against two bad guys ( Mitchell and Morgan ) in a chess match, who are trying to capture Fong and Roundtree and take over the chess business in China. But why is there any chess business in China? It's just so that you and I can use them when we can't be bothered going to Japan to spend $$$ on new cars and fancy restaurants. Click to expand...

That's why they have it, and it's not that hard to get here from any number of countries."|0
this is one of my favorite movies ever ! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust , this is near perfect ! it is one of those movies where you will never look at the dialogue and just enjoy it ! you will never be bored and it will never get old (even though my friends and i would love to watch this movie for over a thousand times lol) it also features the best dialogue ever in a film with the best acting of the best actors of the year , the best directing of all time , the worst acting of anyone ever , it also features the best soundtrack of all time !|0
"Well it might be a kid 's movie ... perhaps but i 'm not gon na let my kids from see anything like this so i 'll not even let them see this movie ... It is the story of how an orphaned boy, whose father died, and whose mother remarried, finds himself living with his new step-mother, who takes him to her hometown, where he tries to help his father's friend, a young man who has fallen ill.

River's Edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters.|1
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as it is to say, Seagal was in this movie.Maybe that is the only thing I can say good about this movie.Seagal’s character is in this movie, and I have to say it was a nice twist on the character of John Wayne.But I can see why this movie failed to make it to the silver screen.They could have done with a few more scenes and with an actor who could carry this role, but this is one of the most poorly made movies you will see.|0
The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934 . I purchased this because I like desert island stories and this one sounded like one. So here we go again with more of the same, I’m afraid. We start with an American pilot who is sent over to England to get drunk. He lands with only two cans of beer and a pack of cigarettes left. One of his mates tells him that all he needs is the money and the rest will follow when he gets to England .|0
"While it's not ""perfect"", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! ""The baby swallowed the watch"" was always my son's favorite line.Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall."|1
I 'm so glad he was n't alive to see this . This movie is a debauchery of his work . It was like he got the money he wanted and had no qualms getting the last word. I've seen his films many times in other countries and they always have the same effect . I could go on but will just leave you with the ending and you can make your own minds up. I don't think I've actually seen this movie but I've been told about the great effect he had on the art of making films.|0
I really tried to like `` Saw . '' The story was good , and I admire the breakneck pace at which it was made. However, there is so much that I didn't like . . . so much that I won't even begin to tell . . . For example, the character who is the main protagonist is an alcoholic who has been in rehab for years, but refuses to admit his problem until one morning when he realizes that his wife ( played by Julia Roberts . . . a real one ) is gone . . .|0
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasn't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest.|1
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. There is so many things wrong with this movie, and it is so hard to watch. This movie is the most boring movie I have ever watched. I would like to give this movie a rating because it did have a lot of things in it, but I feel like I have to give it a rating because this movie was very disappointing.|0
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test.|1
Comedy ? What 's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions ( by the time I met him ) with a shrink to talk about his life issues . I mean, he's dead so he doesn't have to do anything. And the shrink's going to tell him to go get a job or something. And when the deadbeat has to work , he'll be broke and in trouble. But then he's gonna sit and have to listen to him tell him the same story about how all he needs is money to get by and blah blah blah .|0
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best. I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie.|1
This movie tries to be more than it is . First of all , the acting is horrible . You would think they could do a much better job. . The music is so bland that I could have just listened to it again and again. I was hoping for a good action film . Instead , I got a dull boring film. I really wanted to like it because it's the first I've ever seen with a female villain. It would've been so much more if they would have at least given it a fair shot.|0
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. I guess I didn't feel really for the kids. I totally can understand what their gripes were and I know how poor the state of schools are, but I found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. If this comes on TV, don't waste your time. Watch Short Circuit again for the 235th time.|1
"There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. How ""Mostly Martha"" was remade is awful. The title of the movie is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of combining good cooking and USA is awful. If you have seen ""Bella Martha"", well that is the original title and it means ""Beautiful Martha"", this one is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms.Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better."|1
Oh man, this movie was toe-cringing bad. Bad look, awful story...the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie.Yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it. You can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting, that was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a couple of over-the-top sequences obviously.|1
I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.The woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a great job playing the role. I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it.|1
Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place.|1
"This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid-80's I taped this movie (when VCR's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, he looks wonderful and has no affecting ""acting-isms"" (see ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" to know what I mean about that!!). I measure all his performances against this one. He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends."|1
"11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. See this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying ""There's lots of mysteries out there."" followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield."|1
I mean really, really, REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean regular high, i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies).|1
Dick and Jane Harper ( Jim Carrey , Téa Leoni ) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation they have worked for is sold and they are forced to work on a private island, where they are assigned to perform a private service. They try to get the money together to make a better life for themselves on a small island of their own, but, when they are offered a lucrative job, it is too late, and they have to work for the very corporation that was so eager to sell their island.|0
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie. However, not more than 5 minutes later, I was already gouging my eyes out. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. The one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. However, I didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I guess anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie?|1
Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. For starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster.|1
As a rule , I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them . This was a film I really liked . But , it is not that good , for the majority . The film opens with a good story , but it is too short in this case . There are not much to say , as this was a film I will be very happy to forget it , when the next film comes up . The film was , I must say , quite decent . The cinematography was fantastic .|0
I just realized why the colors and sets in `` Sakuran '' were so flashy and gaudy , and just like the anime it was a show where you could wear anything! And to be honest , they look even more appealing with a black and white color scheme. I like that style , so I guess I'll give this show a watch! The story was pretty weak. I like the characters a lot better than most of the shows anime, but they're not interesting enough for me to care much. The only other thing I liked is that the voice acting was better this time.|0
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell pictures for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the movie. I didn't see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY, promising I'd be back.|1
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie , but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline , which is why I rated it only a 3. It had nothing in it that you would call ""movie-making"". This is not bad, because in a sense you are making a movie on the screen , which is really a better way to make movies . But the script is poor. There is no story , there are no characters and there is no depth to it , and I have no idea what to expect from it. I had to stop watching."|0
I really like the show!! As a part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.Rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.This show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on ABC Family? ).My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all of Kappa Tau.|1
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (! ), but KvC ain't quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there.|1
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are to late. Apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. I'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to Curse of the Komodo which also sucked. The computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves.|1
when i watched this crap , it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE , Which is good , the movie had a great title that i wish i could forget . i know its not the greatest movie , but i wish there were a few more funny lines . if the movie was better then that would be the only bad thing about it . if they made this into a movie , it would win an academy award and i would love for it . if you like funny movies with great dialogue , i highly recommend this movie .|0
"Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.Hearkening back to films like ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned"", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing."|1
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good Saturday night movie. I wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.The dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character.|1
Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can't recommend this film.The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort.|1
This movie strayed too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely made it to the middle of the film. Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was trash. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the Chowder Society members either. Hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime.|1
Because that 's what Hell Ride pretty much is . Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein 's money . 's . I guess the Weinstein 's money is the first thing Larry and Tarantino do when they get there because they don ' t know any better . And Larry is going to hell because he was in an elevator accident in Paris and that 's where he got the cancer from . . . and they have to fix Larry up with the girl who is on Larry 's tour. I don't know what the hell to say . . .|0
Irvine Welsh's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh, all with a few of Welsh's trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.|1
So well done . The photography , sound , music and the performances were the best . It 's also the very first to be shown live . The audience loved it and it was a great success ! I went there on Saturday afternoon. It is a beautiful place and I love the idea of doing a concert there. I went there with my daughter. It was beautiful. I was happy to be there for the concert . I hope I will get to see you soon . The show was amazing , great music , amazing sound system and great performances .|0
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. And that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. But this is beyond bad. This movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. First off, the CGI has to be one of the worst i've seen.|1
Gritty drama ? Emotionally powerful ? Blah ! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as HBO's Westworld , Netflix's Jessica Jones , FX's The Americans , Amazon's The Handmaid's Tale , Hulu's American Gods . And now BBC America is on the way too with a sci-fi drama series set to air on the network from 2019. The series – The Fall – comes from writer/executive producer Simon Pegg who is also one of the directors. Pegg was behind the brilliant Peep Show , the hilarious The Office and the Oscar-winning romcom The World's End.|0
What an utter disappointment . Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead . What on earth have they got to offer here ? I mean , if you have nothing to say , nothing to look at , or nothing to see , then what are you doing with the time and effort ? Just get away from this film , get on with the TV series and spend your money somewhere else . Why not ? You can do better than this . If they wanted to make a film , I think they should have left the budget and cast out of it , and taken the cast out of it .|0
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version . I rather enjoyed it . Either way , I found the movie itself enjoyable. It's not a particularly good film overall but I still enjoyed it enough to rate it B-. There is no way you can rate it anything other than an A-. I enjoyed it as much as I could , but if I'm going to rate it that high , there should be something in there to give me some reason to do so. I did like the special effects and I really liked the cast.|0
"I'm an action movie fan but until today I've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" on pay-TV hoping for nothing special.But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.The transformation of Samantha/Charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I've ever seen."|1
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame. George was great in that character - very expressive.Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part. She gave a great performance. She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS.|1
The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie.|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery.|1
"This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious ""In The Realm Of The Senses"", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever."|1
We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. The west Texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him.|1
This film is a nightmare ! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same sensation you felt in the night, but much much worse. In the night you were dreaming. The day you wake up is only a dream, and it never ends. The film is beautiful in its dreamlike aspect. It is a film for the dreamers. When you have no memories of the real world outside of your dreams, reality is something completely different than you thought it was. And when you are able to break free from the dreams in which you exist, then you begin to discover reality.|0
Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car), facing hard time in the Big House with some of the nastiest characters this side of a Russ Meyer pic. Blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout, and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity.|1
`` 200l : A Space Odyssey '' is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind 's relationship with the universe and the nature of knowledge and understanding. Written and directed by Steven Speilberg and from a screenplay by John Kortner, this epic space-opera depicts humanity's journey to discover the universe beyond our own. The film begins with a young astronaut named Neil Armstrong landing on the Moon on July 21, 1969. After years of waiting, humanity 's first trip to the Moon is finally underway. Neil is assigned to command the Apollo 1 mission.|0
"Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in. I have not seen all of his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him best from ""Live and Let Die"" where he played Tee-Hee and which was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona!"|1
Excellent story , wonderful acting , amazing production values and a cool , action-packed short with a perfect twist at the ending. I am glad that i saw it , just like it was the first time i have seen an action-packed superhero film in a long time . I really want to see the first 2-part episode of Agents of S.H.O.O.V.E as well as the complete series . Thank you for making this , it will be a great addition to the ever-growing superhero film genre . I think the way you did this is even more impressive , you did it in just 4 episodes !|0
eXistenZ was a good film , at the first I was wondering what is going on , organic `` pods of life '' the story of the creation of the world in the mind of the god , it is very good and I can't say too much about it , the best film in the series and the most interesting one , it is also the best animated film of the year , it is worth watching if you are looking to see a very interesting experiment , well written , with a very nice and original plot .|0
"Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde ' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it 's intended to be is a fool, and I am willing to admit that I, like nearly everyone who has ever watched it, is at least somewhat charmed by the film . . . but the ""charisma"" and ""sex appeal"" are a lot of horseshit . . . and they only make a good film, in my humble opinion, if they don't make you want to smack someone around . . . like a good movie does."|0
Red Skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox ' on a radio station run by his brother Wally ( Jim Backus who is also an old friend and has known and worked with Skelton before ) , who has decided that he is going to quit and make a better life for himself. The character of The Fox had already existed before the movie, he just wanted to give his audience an opportunity to meet him in his true self. The first time he was revealed was in the radio station.|0
"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The plot revolves around a man named ""John Doe"" who was being forced by his mother to commit a ""suicide"" by throwing himself down the stairs after he gets into an accident when his car hits a telephone pole. This is also the case in ""Inception,"" where we have a woman, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is being blackmailed by an unseen ""man"" named ""Ezra Stane"". The ""woman"" who was being blackmailed is played by Ellen Page."|0
"Once again , I 've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie . It seems like they like the movie but cannot figure out how to say why they think the movie sucks. I don't get it . It's as though they don't believe in ""real criticism"" and therefore cannot provide it. I'll get to the real review in due course . For now though, lets take a step back and examine how the movie came to be . So here's the short version and then the long one ."|0
* * SPOILERS * * I rented `` Tesis '' ( or `` Thesis '' in English ) on the Internet a couple years ago. This was the very first ( and I believe the last ) video game I would ever make. I had heard so many people saying how much they admired this game and how much it captured video game essence. I had seen screenshots and had heard about the game but had never really played it or even played a game that closely. I couldn't wait to get started on my first project and have it finished in time for my birthday.|0
How offensive ! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible . I can imagine those at the back with their hands to their face. I can see those sitting around the dining table at my brother's house reading the bible . I can see those who didn't like this movie sitting there in silence. I really think the reason this movie had so many thumbs up is because of the bible it was based on. It is so sad that this movie was made but it will forever live in my heart with my family.|0
One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far : The story hesitates between a silly thriller with a strong story and an action film that ends with an interesting and suspenseful action scene. I am a sucker for a good plot and well written screenplay and what the director has done is just unbelievable. The film will have a good life after its initial release. This movie is a mixture of action movie and horror movie. I was very much confused by the characters and the story for the duration of the movie itself and it ended up being disappointing.|0
"First off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said ""well, mistakes happen"" and brushed it off. After about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.Now, about the film."|1
"Earth Final Conflict began like a new world , a new vision from the creator of Star trek , something that hasn’t happened before

I was very young when the original Star Trek was made, around the time I learned to speak and understand sentences. The story is set in the late 23rd Century, the story is about a man and his crew who travel the universe. There are some things I do not understand fully and that’s one of them. When I look at that movie, it makes no sense to me."|0
"The recent release of ""Mad Dog Morgan"" on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic DVD version. ""Mad Dog Morgan"" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia."|1
"I'm going to recommend putting this one in the ""skip it"" pile as well. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah, well.....The costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the Period Costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - everyone dressed like they were at court in Versailles."|1
The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist.|1
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series . Well defined characters , tight scripts , varied and interesting locations and a lot of laughs , the series has been a delight to watch from the very start. The film version has a lot of faults , but still is good fun , even if I prefer the TV version . There is a plot which I like and that is that the three men who set out to save the world are the most powerful men in Australia and that they set out to get away with murder.|0
I am an Australian currently living in Japan . I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed. It is very rare to see a Japanese film made in English. It was a very dark movie, as was most of what I saw in Japan . I felt very sorry for the Japanese people at times. So many great Japanese films are released in English. I have never seen any but I have seen some great Japanese films made in English or with a mixture of English subtitles. I love the fact that they are in English!|0
Last year, I fell in love with the Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library. Though I think Burton's is best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I haven't seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on them.After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job.|1
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war.|1
"If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc. ), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of ""The Christmas Story"" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way."|1
Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film ( except note that it needs a DVD and Blu-ray release), so here is a full review. So here it is, your very own review copy of Tintin. I’m glad you came out to see it and I hope that you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. I hope that if you saw this in theatres, that you took a friend, or a loved one, and had some popcorn. Let me give you some background information.|0
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel , but it’s just not the way to get it right. It’s not just that they’re portraying it as though Moses went from Egypt to God and God said, “Okay, you’ve done your best; you did what you came here for,” which is a pretty common trope in the history of science fiction. It’s also that they have made a movie that has an incredibly long-winded narrative with many unnecessary details.|0
"This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series, creepy beyond words. The tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed, in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie. This episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as ""Home"", ""Humbug"" ""Bad Blood"" and ""Milagro"" for being the best in their respective season.Mulder and Scully's growing relationship is put to the test in this episode: Can they really trust each other?"|1
This is strictly for Pryor fans . Just because he was a great , funny guy does n't mean this . I love this guy , I really do .. But , he did say some of the most horrible things you can ever say in a debate , and most people will not ever forgive or forget . He did say it in a debate . The only thing that can put him over the top is the fact that I was in his class during my junior year in HS . I'm not a Pryor fan but I really do think he could help this team.|0
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all . After all , this is just the beginning , and I have a good feeling this will only get better . And so it begins . This is going to be a great series , with great characters and great storylines . I don't know about you but the characters are already interesting , and I'm anxious to see what happens with them in future episodes . One thing that I've noticed in the first five episodes , is that I really don't like the story .|0
This film is absolutely appalling and awful. It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art. The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this film.|1
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick , it would be recognized for what it is: the best movie ever. But director David Lynch has a unique approach to film that makes the whole endeavor something special and, at times, magical. As a man of film, Lynch has seen many of his own attempts come and go. So it's not surprising that his newest project, Twin Peaks, could take so long for him to find the heart of the piece. But his approach to his craft is quite unique.|0
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie. This is deep movie, a pondering of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts (and other who used him) have certainly affected our lives.|1
Help ! Once again , Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull , pedantic storytelling . I rearranged my schedule a week or two ago to see him , as he’s scheduled a return date for his show . I’m still not quite over the shock , but at least I know what the movie is going to be like . I guess my only disappointment , is that Paul had no interest in writing or directing a good movie . When I started reading I found it hard to put the book down .|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film, so I can't really describe how great it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. Then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. YOU JUST CAN'T miss. I mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This film comes on. You watch it and are shocked. It is so brilliant, so original it is so GREAT.|1
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from time to time and it never fails to disappoint me. If you have a problem with wooden performance I would recommend you to try something like the original version. I don't remember the name but it was really really good.I don't think this one is any good. I'm having a difficult time watching the original on TV. I get bored and just want to turn it off. I just can't with it.|0
"First off , I 'm a huge Bronson fan , have been since the late '70s . I watched every Bronson movie and loved them , I'm not much into action or horror movies . I loved Bronson for his roles as a "" straight "" person . Most of the movies are about him getting over his wife's death or his relationship problems . There's one movie I have yet to see , but I'm sure it's on the way . That's about it for Bronson fans and action fans . I'm sure I'm going to come up with some more great movies ."|0
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden, then we should take this stinker down to Gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. They'll be singing within minutes. Of course, I'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the Geneva Convention in several ways. Look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch TV at home. So take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little TV zombie. She got up and walked away after about ten minutes. That's how bad this is.|1
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation . Having watched it again with my daughter a few days ago, I could not get the feeling of anger out of my mind or heart. So many things in this show made me feel ashamed about what had happened. I couldn’t see it all from the outside but from my daughter’s eyes I could. We are not victims, we are the victims, we are in pain, we feel guilty, we feel as if our lives are in pieces.|0
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women). From opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure.Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom.|1
"This ""film,"" and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: ""P.U., stinky poopies!"" Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. That said, there are a few bright spots. The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be."|1
OK , it was a `` risky '' move to rent this flick , but I thought I had nothing to loose. I thought I was going to lose my money, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. I guess I expected something a bit better and it exceeded my expectations. This is a fun flick, even if it is for the kids. The only problem I have with it is it would have worked a lot better in 3-d. I would recommend it to anyone . It is a good movie for all ages.|0
This film is so 1980 's and that is what I like so much about it . It does an admirable job with its characters and setting but it is also a movie about a father who is forced to do what he feels is best for him to do, and the son who can't accept that he may be forced to marry a girl he doesn't want to and can't understand why he can't have a happy family, or a happy marriage . It also does a good job of being a romantic comedy .|0
I actually liked certain things about this game . I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had this for more games. It was very interesting to play the game because you had to decide if you were going to be nice or mean. It was like a morality story. I really enjoyed it and I recommend this game to everyone . I would say that it would be good for kids . There is violence but it's not the usual kind of violent games you can get from them . It's not something they can understand . The graphics are good .|0
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch . With such a super cast , it 's a shame that not enough time was spend on the script and characters . It 's very slow and has no pacing at all , which made it not as enjoyable . I think it 's more of a movie where you can get a little more information from the beginning , so that it 's more about you , and not the movie itself . I thought it was a very disappointing movie , and not worth watching . This movie is a waste of an amazing cast .|0
Got to confess right up front that I did n't watch this entire movie . I missed the first hour or two because I did n't want to be distracted by my laptop . I have a friend who does n't watch movies so when we talk about movies he is more likely to hear about the movies he watched than the movies he didn't .. I did n't see it at a theater so I didn't feel I would get to see it at all. I read a book review here which was very positive. So I went to see it and I did not want to miss it.|0
Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head.|1
"Okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but I actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. At the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). This baby falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category to me, and for that alone I would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day."|1
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. The acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid.|1
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. It is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny.|1
I must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of Camp Blood.Camp Blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.The DVD was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.Don't do what I did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.|1
"Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on this forum. In short, the debate is whether it is the same thing or not. However, there are many different types of ""R"" on this planet and we should not be afraid to call out people for who they are when they do something we find unacceptable. The first and most obvious point is that there are many different kinds of R and only some of these are dogs. If you don't see that then we have little hope in your ability to reason as a rational being."|0
"This movie was outright painful for me to watch . I understand that indie films do not have the same budget as Blockbusters but I feel that they are still important to tell the stories that are important to us as humans. I just wish we could see them more. I have seen this movie before, it is called ""The Hurt Locker"", there are some scenes from it in there, but not much else. I think the movie is pretty good, but I think the ending is very, very emotional. I just hope it has a better ending after the movie ends."|0
I logged on here right after watching this movie, feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. And so, since I want the job done right...From the opening shot, the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard.|1
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD by it's cover. I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. The music was pretty ordinary.|1
The only reason I checked this film out was to see the `` early '' Kim Bassinger . That , and I really wanted to see if his wife was in the cast , too . And that , and there is something I really like about her on the whole . She looks like she is going to be as tough as nails , and not afraid of what she can do . And she looks good on the whole , and I hope I am wrong about this . And I also really like the whole idea of the character .|0
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie. It appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Alas, it didn't hold up.I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization.The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed.|1
"I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. Had it been labelled an ""artsy film"" I wouldn't have purchased the DVD; now I have a DVD that I'll never watch again and who would buy it?"|1
... out of this movie.Sorry to say , this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival . Our copy did not have this on it but that should not make a difference in a review . What does make a difference is that if you saw the film and thought it was boring it would not be boring if it was not so bad . The only thing that could redeem this film is if you did not like it and enjoyed it . This is one of those rare films that is just so bad it should not even exist .|0
His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace.|1
Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible for a number of reasons:No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.Once again: Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible.No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.|1
This movie was painfully awful . Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods , walking thru the middle of nowhere and trying to save themselves . Its like a B movie . It had so many flaws that are hard to describe . It was not worth my $10 . There was no way this movie should have been allowed to have its way and make such a mockery of itself . The idea of it was interesting , but once it had gotten going there was no saving it . I'm not sure that I want to take it out in front of kids .|0
Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious.|1
Down at the Movie Gallery , I saw a flick I just had to see . It looked like a movie noir from the 1930's, and to my surprise I liked the movie. It was called The Girl in White. I have seen that before , but this was so much better, because it took place on a ship, and I think I had never seen a boat in the movies that was anything like it. I have always wanted to see how the movie was filmed, but never thought it was possible. Well, you can.|0
`` Catchfire '' or `` Backtrack '' as it is sometimes called , is not very good . That is not because it's not very fast but because it is not flexible enough . When it comes to flexibility it has some limitations , which are a little hard to understand , and not at all clear at first sight. However , once it's learned it can be extremely powerful, and very powerful in some areas. So I will try to explain some of them so that they will make more sense. To use Catchfire as it is now , you must be aware of some limitations .|0
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries , odds are you will find this one fascinating . Not only does it provide a unique look into a life and career that many people would never know, but it also shows the struggles that the men and women involved were faced with at every stage of their lives. There are several aspects that stood out to me and others that are worth mentioning. First is the use of archival footage and interviews. When the camera is not on the subject , you can always tell who is who.|0
"The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. She realizes that she can ""feel"" and ""see the real world""."|1
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race , the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a psycho killer who is on a revenge trip. But it turns out that the killers are actually running for their lives as they're hunted by the only person left to stop them -- the one man who saved the men from their pasts. The killer, however, isn't human. He's a vampire who can kill anyone at any time, and can't be killed unless the vampire dies first.|0
i ca n't even describe it . it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen ( i 'm being really, really polite here ). -i had a friend who would go out to dinner at his favorite restaurant once a month and eat there every week for two years. i met him through work, but i never knew his favorite restaurant. they were all very nice, but i was never sure whether he really liked them because he never told me. eventually i gave up asking. -my sister used to make me watch movies for no reason.|0
"I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad ""effects"" which got me annoyed through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. This film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end."|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations.|1
Yep , it 's me again ! Mr ' I sit through crap so you do n't have to'.What do you mean ? Do you work at a video store ? And if not , then how did you end up here ? I don't get it , it's like the guy from the other day , but without the money ! Or the one from the day before . But you don't have any money ? And you have no shame ! You think you are better than us , and you have no shame at all .|0
Take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? Something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing.Seven Alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film.The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere.|1
"This movie took me by surprise. I first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. It's got it's just plain boring points, and I, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, ""What the hell is this?"|1
"Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident ""The Wind and the Lion"" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa.El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman(Candice Bergen) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of American president Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre.The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photography, very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness."|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C&W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, creepy former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave.|1
Deepa Mehta 's `` Fire '' is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic . A masterful social commentary on the present political state of U.S. race relations , Mehta turns her fire on many of the country's most destructive institutions , including the criminalization of black people, racial profiling , and economic inequality . This is history's most important book and a must-read for students of social justice and critical race theory , as well as students of the American experience . But in order to understand its significance , you have to know the author's personal story.|0
I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons.Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.This movie.|1
Chop Shop , the second feature from Ramin Bahrani , is a rare breed . It is an American film , shot in the United States , based on a book of the same name that was first published in 1973 . It was the first novel by the Iranian writer , Sohrab Sepehri . In it , a young Iranian man travels from Tehran to Beirut , and from Beirut to New York . But , he never returned . He was murdered , in 1978 . Bahrani , who was born in Tehran and is of Iranian ancestry , went to Los Angeles , in the 1970s .|0
"Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth 's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality. But this isn't a fair comparison because he doesn't use the term ""trolls."" Instead, he uses a term like ""lumbersexuals."" He uses this term because he doesn't really have a good definition, but it has a kind of meaning to him that he uses to try and describe what the women in his life are like. Because, like, what do you call someone who looks for sex but doesn't actually want to get sex?"|0
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I 've seen in a long time.It 's marketed as as Sci-Fi. But you would know this movie would never work. It is not based on actual fact. You know it is not based on anything. The movie is so bad, it just makes me want to vomit. It is an example of what you can do to an actor to destroy a career. I have no idea why they would put him in this movie, but I'm sure that they should have just thrown him out on his ass.|0
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. Besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters.|1
Years ago , I used to watch bad movies deliberately . Somehow I missed this one . No gesture rings are in this movie . You won’t be able to avoid bad movie . But it may be just like you . The movie was called “ I’m a Bad Girl “ . The name of the movie was so bad . I don’t know why but I must watch it as well . The film is in Hindi with the same cast and same crew . The film is directed and produced by Anurag Basu .|0
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going . The first scene shows a man going into a bar and getting hit in the face by a drunk man . The bartender tells the drunk man to go on back and finish off the man who was already in the bar . So the guy goes over to where the man who has already gotten hit in the face was standing and pulls out a gun and shoots him . The story goes on to the next day when he gets into a car and heads over to where the other man has gotten shot .|0
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on . It brings back happy times for me . I grow a lot of my friends in those years. I see them grow into what they are now and it brings tears to my eyes to think they might never see this day . I love them. Thank you for your part in this story. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. P.S - I just found out about this event. I'm planning on watching it. I just want to know what happened in this story to make this possible.|0
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson , while on an American troop transport in the Philippines during World War II. The pilot dies on their arrival in Tokyo. The film received negative reviews and was not released in America until 1958, when it was released on videotape by United Artists . Plot

A young German woman named Helene von Stauffenberg lives in Berlin, but after receiving a telegram telling her that she must leave Germany for the United States and marry a pilot, she takes the train to Germany."|0
"Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie. The filmthen flashbacks to the few days before the rape, as Beller isharassed by a stranger.Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson andDennis Quaid are double dating early on. Beller's anxious parents,laid back Tony Bill and shrill Blythe Danner, wait at home wringinghands and so on.

"In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything ""real"" about this legend need to grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. You guys seriously need to grow up.The fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't do it either."|1
The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I have n't seen every film released in his lifetime. It means the movie that I saw and rated was NOT on the list. But then again, I'm a guy, who is in no way able to judge the films of any male. I can only judge movies based on my personal liking. I am surprised that people are willing to listen to a male critic who is able to judge only the films of males, when he is able to give an opinion on films made by females.|0
Story of a strange love and a fall desire . Poem about beauty and his perfection , fear and touch.A man ,who love , and his beauty and fear . He loved me like no one else could do. I was everything that I had ever dreamed of in a woman, but he was too perfect . I loved him so much , even though I was a little scared of him . But it was not my fault that he wanted me. That was all on his part. And it was my way of reacting to his love .|0
"it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. I rented this ""movie"" cuz of the drop ""h.p. lovecraft"" on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver!"|1
Now , lissen you guys , I LOVED THIS FILM , though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE LOST , which I also had on the list. And I would be very sad if this got released since I love this film so much , it is my favorite. I was very surprised it got released so soon , and if it did get released , I probably wouldn't go to see it , but I really hope it gets released, because it deserves it , and also , I thought I might as well share my thoughts about this movie , since it was so good .|0
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the ""F"" word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this."|1
"I love old ""monster movies"" for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird.The ""science"" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest."|1
Although it was dark, depressing, and at times hard to watch, You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. Her compelling and believable performance made the movie. It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute. Who knows.|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. It was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. Running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), No close-ups!!|1
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this ... well , bizarre film . Canada becomes part of the world's second-largest economy at the end , but it's not going down quietly. The film tells a very different story from that told in recent years by the country's prime minister and the prime minister-elect, Justin Trudeau. Trudeau had, as a child, a fascination with the country he would later call his second home. That fascination has blossomed into his ambition to run for leadership of the country he grew up in.|0
"This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of ""Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" and am now watching ""Enterprise"".I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It is more like an attempt at slapstick.It does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. It does little to build the series.Why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. Was it the writing? Was it the directing?"|1
The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing , in which objects such as DVD and CD players, televisions, and microwaves are no longer in demand because of their small screen and low price. At the same time, mobile phones with touchscreens and internet connectivity have made their appearance, while other types of devices such as digital video recorders and other electronic devices have become common. The downsizing trend is accompanied by a shift of the market to the low price segment, and is accompanied by a tendency of the market to adopt “upgrading” instead of new sales.|0
"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but I must say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, yet all is not as it seems; a sort of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things an people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis, and thought, ""this can't be the whole reason?"""|1
"**May Contain Spoilers**The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced ""dee-SAYd"") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant ""Nubian"" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME."|1
"This film reeks of production line planning. It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film does address the age of the Stewart/Allyson performers; though, I'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.There are messages in ""Strategic Air Command"" I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick with one truly wretched element: The happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife."|1
My son Adam ( 5 years old ) is a big Scooby Doo fan . He like this film a lot . And he loves the new one . He likes this one too . But when he was watching this film he cried . I told him that he can watch it all day and all night he loves the movie . But he was very sad . He said , I am sad because Scooby Doo died . I said that I am sad too because Scooby died . He said that he loves Scooby , he loves Scooby more than dad . I said that we can still do some things .|0
People call a 976 `` party line '' to talk dirty to strangers , and perhaps meet up for a few beers . It's the number you've dialed if someone calls to chat with you on the phone . It can be the first call you make after you get home after a night on the town . The service may have been available years before it came up on your caller ID , and has been around for a while . But it wasn't on your computer . In fact, you probably have no idea what a ``96X,'' as it's called, is for .|0
River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of American youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.Much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.This unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in American society.Those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast.|1
Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called `` Half Empty . '' I usually go out of my way to write reviews of films I know nothing about. There is nothing to learn about such a film from the reviews I write about it and I would rather not waste my time by spending my valuable time discussing with you about the film. I want to review the film for my own entertainment as much as you do. I don't have the time to go through the film and explain the plot of the film to you.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them but I ended up going to the theater with a friend and it turned out to be an awesome movie. I can't wait for the next one because it's the only one I can see that is not a B-Movie! First time I saw this movie it was on TCM a few months ago and I have been wanting to see it ever since! The reviews I've read on the IMDB have been stellar and I'm sure that's the reason I was drawn to this movie so much!|0
"Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white, while they conveniently forget that both ""Clerks"" and ""Schindler's List"" were filmed in black & white and are great movies.Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black & white are the same people who wouldn't like ""Psycho"" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes."|1
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans.|1
This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in . Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and direct . The rest of the cast is not much to brag about , and I don't really care . If I had a daughter I think I would have told her that when she was in her early teens she should leave her friends behind , and when she grew up she could decide for herself which friends she wanted to keep around her. If you want to follow your dream , that is up to you.|0
"""Wagons East"" is widely known as John Candy's last movie, as he died on the set. That's just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. It's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it."|1
"Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy ""The Grissom Gang"", a reworking of the 1948 British film ""No Orchids For Miss Blandish"", has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her."|1
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime . Now they look back on their pasts with regret, as they are just trying to survive and stay relevant today. They are also in their late 20s or early 30s. Geishas aren't really known for their longevity, but in the case of Kyoko and Yukiko they are at least in their early 50s. They are both now living in their parents' homes and have no immediate plans to go to work, but their lives seem to be a constant struggle to keep afloat, despite their efforts to do so.|0
The back of the DVD for this movie raves , `` Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films . . . one of my favorite directors and writers . . . and Chey . . . , `` is in his prime . . . Chey always delivers and so do his actors. ``Chey is one of those rare producers who is a real visionary . . . one who makes it seem effortless. Chey is the kind of producer that you want on your label . . . Chey produces the kinds of films that you expect to have on your label . . .|0
Oh boy . Films like this really bother me . If this movie is supposed to close to truth , why isnt there any evidence . There isnt anything to prove this a real case . If there are no evidences , it doesnt mean they are real . I mean , if you have the evidence , why cant it be in the movie ? That movie wasnt about the truth , that movie was more about how to manipulate the viewer . That's how fake it was . They did a great job of it . The fact is , when a person hears what the truth is , it isnt very believable .|0
First of all , even IMDb is slacking with this movie , as the list of cast is VERY ``inadequate`` for the movie. There are only 3 actors cast for the movie, and it is almost a waste of the time and efforts of people to cast only 3 characters , especially those who are not famous. That is why I would rather go with a movie which has decent cast , even if it is not in the same genre. As a movie which has ``average casting`` , and with the cast as it is , you will surely enjoy the film .|0
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago , and I can honestly say to is one of the most powerful books I have read to date . I have since then come to love it . I loved it from its opening sentence, “A man walks into a bar .” It was written as an introduction to a book, not a synopsis or review of it . In fact, the book’s description is that it was written to be read within the first 5 chapters. The book then continues to introduce us to each character we meet.|0
"Yah. I know. It has the name ""Sinatra"" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this thinking it was some movie I missed in the theaters. It's not. It's some garbage ""movie"" made by the folks at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! It's not good. I am as big a Sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb."|1
"""Hey, I didn't order no cab!"" ""Yeah, well you got one..."" What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America's TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode."|1
Okay , I grew up on Who , but have n't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker . Christopher Eccleston and Matt Smith are two who have had a long and storied run on Doctor who. For me , Matt Smith and Tom Baker are the two most iconic Doctors in the entire history of the show . Both of them brought an air of honesty to a character who many fans loved to hate . It is my honor to introduce to you two who are the best Doctor in Doctor Who history . The two Doctors are now married with children .|0
"As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many over dramatizations in ""made for TV movies"" and the craziness of the reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience.I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict."|1
`` The Journey '' is a romantic version of the cold war . It 's about an English woman ( Claire Danes ), who is forced to move to Moscow in order to be with her father and her young daughter. She has an affair with a young KGB officer ( Vadim Borisov ), who falls for her and becomes her husband in Moscow. When his work gets in the way he leaves, but their love is still strong. She then has to find a new lover in London to make her husband go to Moscow to take care of a sick person.|0
If good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made . but the story that director james bond has been trying to tell his entire career is as interesting and original as the idea that he tried to bring to life . it might be the most original movie you see this year . the story is about a young couple that get married in the summer of 1961 and live happily ever after . they are so happy , in fact that they forget to tell anyone what is happening in their lives .|0
The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel `` Nanny '' Crosby , who runs a boardinghouse and provides for the family in a simple yet charming way. But as with the rest of the city, Lackawanna has gone through hard times. `` I've seen a lot of my friends and acquaintances have to give up or sell their businesses because of the economy. The only thing we had going for us were our families and friends, so I wanted to do something that would help out the community,'' she says.|0
I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur . Her bugging her eyes is what I remember about her, especially in 'Curse Of The Pink Panther' where they're bugging her eyes out as she's about to do something that will have consequences (if she does what she thinks she has to do) and she's scared to death, yet she can't stop herself. She's like that in the end. I don't remember much about that film, I had seen it when I was about 12.|0
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title ""Acrobatty Bunny"", it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that, it's quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in ""Big Top Bunny""."|1
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60 's, and 70's. This movie has no nudity, no sex, and very little swearing and fighting. It is about the love of two good looking young men, and their lives and relationship with each other. The two young men get in a feud over the girl, with one wanting to take her, and the other wanting to keep his. The two love each other and become best friends over a period of about a year.|0
I loved this film , Independent film-making at its best . The cinematography , pacing , rhythm , and acting is outstanding . The music and the acting is perfect . Some scenes are just so perfect that you will have to rewatch the movie again. This film was well worth watching again. This is an excellent film.The acting is excellent , the acting is superb , the editing is well thought out and very well produced. I would say it is a very good, solid film that takes itself a bit too seriously but that is fine by me as I have seen this film and will not be back for another film .|0
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that didn't really show. There wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive.|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world , I think it is better than most over the top action films of today . The action sequences were awesome with a good story to back them up . The movie was not as good as what i expected to see . Not too many flaws . The only thing that bothered me was the editing which seemed a bit off . There is nothing wrong with the movie , it just did not do what was expected of it . Overall though , I think this movie is worth your time and money .|0
This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film.|1
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, the first thing I saw was that this was based on a novel. I’ve been meaning to read the book for awhile, so when I did, I knew I had to check this movie out. What was great about the film was how it was shot – it really feels like you are inside someone else’s mind. Alicia, played by Eva Green, is on the run from her past. She is hiding in her apartment, as her past catches up with her.|0
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious ""star"" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity."|1
This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks.|1
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen . Although not directed by George Cukor he did produce and direct the movie, he was an executive producer. It was directed by Joseph H. Lewis and it was produced by Edward Lewis, it is an excellent film, one that every cop should see. I just saw this and it's a very good film, especially in the second half, where you really get to get to see what cops are really doing on a day to day level.|0
They call this film `` euro trash horror '' . Well , it 's not horror . The film takes its cues from the gory slasher films that were so popular in the mid 80s . A young couple are about to celebrate their wedding anniversary. One night when they are alone in the country the wife is murdered and the murderer leaves behind a bloody footprint . He then goes after her husband . Now this is not a typical slasher . This is more in the vein of the exploitation films of that period . But i did like the idea of the victim being married and the wife being a blonde who is attractive .|0
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles . . . and it has nothing to do with a jury box or a justice system. It’s called the Los Angeles Pardons Unit, or LAPD PARDONS, and the four members of this unit are themselves lawyers. One of the four members is a retired L.A. district attorney who used to have an office down the street from my father’s firm in the heart of downtown, and he was the one who convinced the police to set up the Pardons Unit to administer justice and keep criminals from going free.|0
First of all , I personally adore Demons and Demons 2 , I saw them although it was hard to believe that it was a remake they were so original, they had a very dark tone, dark graphics and a dark sense of humor . I believe that is where the charm of the series lies, it not only had the humor but also the horror factor which made the series even more intense. I have only watched part of the series and I must admit that it is not for me, I find it to be one of the best horror shows on the TV.|0
The producers of this picture are Hungarians . It 's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are able to perform the trick they perform in this picture . . . well, perhaps not exactly by art . . . but certainly with an intensity of creative genius never before seen in this film . I 'll explain . . . I 'm trying to learn Hungarian now . . . my wife (who speaks better English than me) and I have only just begun . . . it 's very exciting . . . but the way they speak is so beautiful, and they use very simple words .|0
Well, I have been to a British University, in fact I went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. This is a horrible, badly made and acted film. Worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true British Students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics???|1
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning. I know I’ll get some of those details when I watch it again, but I didn’t notice. That being said, this movie is very good. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. It is very good, I have a feeling it is one of those movies that you will want to watch again many times, I am pretty certain that is how it was for me.|0
Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car. She kicks ass and kills guys with an umbrella. The plot is simple. The characters are also simple. In the end, the movie is just a good old story about a good old woman, a bad bad guy, and a little girl who has to grow up first. The story begins in a small rural town where we meet the local sheriff, Bob, and his new deputy, Sam. They just bought a nice house and the sheriff says that Bob is going to have a party.|0
First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I have watched it almost 10 times just because I've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece.The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert.|1
What can I say about this? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End? Wasted Time, wasted Money.This work a disaster is historically seen. Only some examples:* Augustus often is named 'Gaius' - his First name (Pronomen). But the old Romans don't used this Name. Correct would be the Surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. * Livia was shown as tyrannic Wife. But this historically wrong. * Iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one.|1
"Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. The one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the IMDb.I found ""What Alice Found"" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that I have seen this year. It's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing?"|1
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I popped this sucker in. It was worse than I had expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. There was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. Now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were?|1
"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. This movie focused more on a ""let's just make it gory"" view.The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. I wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively."|1
The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons!|1
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I ca n't believe that the writer and director did n't see this movie before release.It's just a matter of waiting. I'm glad you are pleased. I thought that this was probably the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. I was in the cinema for the first time last week, so I didn't know if it was going to be at all watchable. I thought I might as well go out on a high note as it is my birthday today, and it was my first time in a cinema.|0
The Governess was , by far , a very pitiful film . I do not use this word loosely , because to describe it , you have to be kind to yourself , and I am not that . The plot was not bad . It was the ending , the ending of the film that ruined the film . And the reason is very simple , and very easy to answer, the reason is because in the ending of the film , it was very clear , very clear , that the film was made with the intention of a sexual titillation .|0
"I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. But when I saw the beginning credits, I said ""oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan who used to star on my favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put on a few pounds but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. too bad I didn't sick around to see her in the film. I bailed out 20 minutes into he film."|1
"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs , I 'm sure it would sound like a variation of ""We're going out of town on business, but it's been so crazy the last week and I'm just too tired to even think about packing."" I don't actually know if anybody is going to see the movie because they're probably all too tired to go to the theater. I do know the people who will be there will like it. But they're probably too tired to sit through the movie."|0
I really do n't know why I 'm writting this . I think most people agree that this movie is a bit too long, but not all. I think if they shortened this to about 15 minutes, it would be a good movie. That would make it interesting to watch without getting bored. So I think 15 min is a good cut. But, I really do think they did it just right. I believe that if they had shortened the movie, the result would have been a watered down and boring one. So, I really do enjoy this movie .|0
I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there's also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert!|1
Do n't get me wrong , I love most of Paul Schrader 's movies , so it was with sheer excitement that I first saw his debut feature ' Dog Day Afternoon'. He had just started working with Woody Allen at the time and the two were already collaborating on several projects together and had been developing some projects of their own , but it is not known if it was either of those that brought him to the attention of Schrader , who was at the time a struggling writer looking to make the leap to the big screen as director .|0
First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!? !If any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it.|1
A horrendous film , ill-conceived and crude . The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to the rest of this film that one wonders why it was even made . The film is not only unenjoyable , it is bad cinema . We can be certain that it was never intended for the mainstream cinema . It was made by a man for his own personal pleasure . It is therefore a sad day indeed when it will be released on DVD . This film is based on the true story of the murder of a young woman by John Lennon .|0
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. There is not one... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. The Crows.... Hitchcock did it superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this film falls short of a well done attack scene. The creepy crawly boy... The Grudge did it and did it better. The psycho...done in Cold Creek Manor most recently, however it has been done to death. No pun intended.|1
Ahh , nuthin ' like cheesy , explopitative , semi-porn , masquerading as horror ... This one stars Jaqueline Lovell, an American actress . She is in her early 50s , wears very short shorts ( she was born on 2 September ) and her hair is cropped . She is wearing very high heels . She is sitting with her boyfriend in a car and a woman comes from a car in front and approaches the car , looks at him and asks if they have any condoms . It seems like a joke , but I don't think that she has any .|0
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere.|1
TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids.|1
"It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half-an-hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so I naively thought). The mutt fails to look all that fearsome, which Leonard Maltin, the notoriously clueless/hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree with: he considers Cujo to be ""genuinely frightening""."|1
For once a sequel to `` The Karate Kid '' without Ralph Macchio ! Hilary Swank did an excellent job in playing her own daughter. Her performance as the daughter was good. The movie was not very intense. I would have liked a better script. My favorite scene was near the end when Ralph gets beaten by a Karate kid and the Karate kid gets the belt. That made this movie a good one. I would recommend the movie. It did not have much acting but the scene that made you feel the movie was made was when Ralph gets beaten by the Kid.|0
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.Unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. Earl Dwire plays a halfbreed white and Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day.He and his gang happen upon Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don't have anything worth robbing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and have his way with her.|1
"How awful is it ? Let me count the ways : 1 ) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out with some great music and sound design, but then goes so off the track it doesn't know which direction it's supposed to go.2 ) There are so many good things about the movie and the movie itself, I don't know how anyone could take offense at this movie. I was not surprised by this. It's not the first time I have seen a movie that starts out well, but then falls apart. It happened with ""Cinderella Man"" way back in the day."|0
This film SUCKS ! ! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random . Good gore action but bad direction ! .I didn't think there was an actual story with the characters at all . The ending just seems contrived like something out of one of those Japanese anime that have no story and then they just make it up as they go ! . It's not even a complete movie . I feel like the ending would have been better like the opening of the movie . First off I will say this movie has it's good and bad points.|0
This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced USA drama. The characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.Just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. I guess it was no a low budget film. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. Maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.No more hope in cinema...|1
This story starts at the end ! So the film's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950's. The story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.The story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke.|1
Wow . What can I say ? I was born in 1960 . I love bad TV movies . Love watching them . Love watching people who are the same in real life . Love people who are mean . But most of all love being able to say that to someone . I never have been able to meet someone . I never felt like I would . It just didn't happen . Yet I always knew that one day . The day would come . But I always knew it wouldn't be for a long long time . I also knew that I would not be a very happy person .|0
This movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. This kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. Only thing I appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career.|1
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between the characters at all until the credits were rolling.I was in awe of how well the actors played off each other.It is the kind of odd film that is a perfect fit for the Halloween season. If you don't live close to the theatre or don't have any plans to make a trip to your local cinema, this might be the movie for you.This one is available on DVD, Hulu, Google Play and other streaming services.|0
Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it.|1

It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists . Sometimes , even without the 20/20 vision of hindsight, one can guess what the works were about without having ever seen or heard them – and even if the artist had no clear idea for what the paintings were going to become, they had to be good in order to be taken seriously as works of art. It is for this reason that a great deal of time has to be spent in looking at paintings in order to make sense out of them, not least the time it costs to see them.|0
"A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the ""Godzilla"" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like ""The Loch Ness Horror"". And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits."|1
I 'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts , nor am I bothered by the cynical , self-righteous stance the so called religious are taking as they have been taking over the last few years , but I do find it very hard to believe they would want to go out with a person who openly admits to their religion's hypocrisy , and their lack of tolerance towards other people's religion and belief's , and yet they are willing to stand by and watch their children suffer , when they themselves don't stand by and watch their children suffer .|0
"Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. The ""plot"" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he's called a ""military adviser"" but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not), helping the army of a Latin-American country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a ""sports equipment saleswoman"" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue."|1
"First of all, i have nothing against Christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. I don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this ""movie"", because I couldn't find any of those in this. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some sake has abandoned religion."|1
An under-appreciated , unseen gem . Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant , heartbreaking fashion , the true meaning of family . And the way in which we are all so closely connected and affected by that family . It’s a book that resonates with you from start to finish . We’re really lucky to live in a country that is so accepting of all people regardless of the way in which they come from . But as we all know , some people just don’t belong . And those people don’t need to be accepted .|0
There was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. One common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.Down Periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. Not an original or terribly well written screenplay. A few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case.|1
Here's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man.Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep.|1
I rented this movie expecting it to suck , and it did n't let me down . I rented it becuase of the star's name , and I thought they would do a mediocre job of it. I didn't expect anything great and I wasnt disappointed . The only thing I don't like is that the author put his name in all of the credits . I had no clue that I had rented this movie , I was very confused when I watched it.I think I would watch it again because I liked the story , and I really enjoyed the ending .|0
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for ME. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly) .|1
I do n't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad . It Was Great! I have seen a good few films lately, but have never been this impressed and moved by a film. It's almost like you are watching a movie, with all the emotions you feel in a real story, you don't realize you're experiencing it. I would recommend this movie for people who like a film that deals with mental illness in a non-serious way and for people who have never seen a really good film.|0
This was a sordid and dreary mess . I needed a shower when it was over . It goes something like this . It starts out nice and pleasant . You do something for him . You do something nice for his family . Then you do something else for him and his family . Then another thing . When you are finished . You do something else . And then you do that thing . And then it’s time to do something else . It was not a pretty scenario . I will admit it was hard to watch the man .|0
"Everyone has their choice for `` worst movie they 've ever seen . '' Some like to pick on Gigli, but I think that's ridiculous. It had a good cast, the director was a nice guy and even if the plot wasn't great it had some interesting things in it. But really, it had nothing special. I think the one I liked better was "" The Manchurian Candidate . "" It was more than a thriller. It had a good cast and good plot, and even though there wasn't too much to it, the plot and the characters made it good."|0
What can I say ? ? This movie has it all ... Romance , break-ups , rich kids , punks , teenage angst , drugs , sex and rock-and-roll ... I think we all like to be in love. I remember reading about this movie in one of my books in the library. I never had heard of it at that time. But I still liked it and read it from the book because I felt it was an excellent movie. I was in 8th grade when I saw this movie in the movie theatre with the big screen and I was amazed at what the director/writer/actors have done with the film.|0
I realise it's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a Charleton Heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better.The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-Pharoh like. The acting really wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one.|1
"In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was ""Just a Nightmare"" and it was very well written!! and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks."|1
"There 's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee . The bimbo in the office will tell you she'll be able to afford one for $100. You tell her the truth--it'll cost $400. It'll probably take her a few weeks to pay off. But when the time comes to take that final trip out, you'll be able to afford it, all right, if you buy it from her."" For some reason, I didn't feel the need to argue with her about the cost. Not yet."|0
I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrid and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age I did not laugh once at the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the 'R' movie my parents were in.|1
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling.|1
"Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down . His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched . Earth's premier sci-fi author is being remembered not only for his groundbreaking books such as ""Fire in the Sky,"" ""Voyager,"" or ""Tales of the Future."" But also for his contributions to pop culture as a creator of such iconic characters as Captain James T. Kirk, Spock and Star Trek's Captain Kirk himself . Star Trek’s “The Undiscovered Country” was an original science fiction TV series which debuted in 1978 on NBC, followed by three sequels in 1979, 1981 and 1983."|0
"Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive order and once with the scenes in time order. They are all very good! I don't really know what is up with DVD's - they have so many problems, but here are some of the most important things I think we should keep in mind:

Most people are happy with the ""normal"" way of doing things - because they don't really understand why it is so difficult for us to follow the ""normal"" way."|0
Strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. Includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. Wife Anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. There are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any Al Adamson flic), but it's no Night of the Living Dead.|1
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. The acting was over the top. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl.|1
I love this show . It 's clever and very well acted . David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry and are superbly talented . I feel this show will not last forever . You just have to get the right mix of actors to give it longevity . I can see it ending in April . There's still one more season or two to go and it is only the first season . Just like any other network , HBO will change its format as to how to end each season and how they end each episode . This show is just great . It's a must see .|0
One of the more prominent/popular episodes , but clearly one of the worst . A red-shirt female falls for Khan while he is working as a driver for her father , but he becomes enraged and begins harassing her , as if she has done something to him . He then drives her off into the sunset. This episode was horrible. She was a prostitute and he is trying to get her to leave. I don't understand what she did to deserve his wrath. I can understand why someone would make an excuse and go after a john who was raping her.|0
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy.|1
"Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for ""Lady Frankenstein"", a stagy, costumy Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten(""Citizen Kane"")plays the crusty old Baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-ntless European B-films, usually as Rosabla Neri, including ""Hercules Against the Moon Men"", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."|1
A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons. The spaceship contains a small library, which contains a volume by a certain author. This volume was discovered by the main character's grandfather, and was the reason for him joining the spaceship in the first place, but the author died long ago and his heirs were unable to decipher his book. The ship was built before the main characters were born. Their father had to travel to a far off world to get the building materials.|0
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival . Rupert Grint shows he can act and direct at the same time, so I was interested to learn that he is also a musician. He played two songs from one of the new movies I saw last week (Mud, which also played at this year's Sundance Festival, and The King's Speech), both of which got big laughs from the audience. Rupert's voice and guitar skills are obvious here, and it was an enjoyable experience hearing his songs in this film.|0
"This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship . Not ONE review described it as ""a true coming of age tale for gays."" They all said it was a love story. And it was. But the way they worded it, it sounds more like it was written specifically for straight guys who wanted to see how much more loving they could really get than what they'd gotten before in movies. Of course, the real reason that it got a 3 out of 4 is because it features a straight couple in drag."|0
Wow , Stella Shorts are great ! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella , the TV show . They look great . I like the look of Stella Shorts ! I was looking at them yesterday for my daughter's school uniform. They have an interesting look to them I liked them so much I ordered some more for me . I think I will have a couple of pairs I will need to add to my wardrobe. I have been working out a lot in the last 2-3 weeks. I am still in pain and my right arm and shoulder are killing me.|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. People just don't act that way in real life situations. My question is: Who would fund such crap?The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes.|1
What can I say about this movie , it really is one of the worst gay themed movies , ever made. When my friend told me the story of the movie I thought he might be joking , but turns out he was actually correct. So what the hell is going on , I ask myself ? Is this a straight film , or is this based on a gay male story or a story with a lesbian twist ?? The only thing that makes this movie bearable is that it has a good cast , I mean what else would you expect from two great actors such as Danny Trejo and John Leguizamo ?|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the DVD has just arrived! So I thought I'd do a Julie Andrews binge. I've been following the Julie Andrews saga since I was young, when she played The Boy with the Thorn in His Side in the 1954 film version of the classic children's book by E.B. White (it was my first introduction to Julie Andrews). The movie took three years to produce, as she was contracted to make only two movies. But the studio wanted four.|0
This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen . I 've spent four years at the Academy. This is not a movie for the young and the elderly. It is so full of holes in the plot, characters and the script . It is so bad I can't think of another review I could offer . It has no soul and no humanity . If you are in the mood for a good family movie , this isn't it . It has no heart and no soul . If you enjoy a good comedy , it is not your thing , either .|0
This is an odd movie . On the surface it 's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but there 's something different about this movie . I've watched it on cable a few times and it always left me cold . There's a reason I only watch new movies . But this was different . There was something in there that just kept pulling me in . There's something about that one shot . I've seen a few movies with that same shot , but this was different . I just kept thinking ' this is one of the most bizarre scenes I've ever had the pleasure to view . '|0
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing this film,we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy,such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage,and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said, that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!|1
Never mind the serious logic gaps , never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals , never mind the haphazard writing , never mind the uninteresting plot, it’s still a pretty good adaptation of a pretty decent book. And if you’re not going to like it, then what the hell are you doing here? You can’t like a film like this if you haven’t tried the book. And even though the book is over 30 years old, you’re not going to like it if you haven’t tried the movie adaptation.|0
"I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she ""finds herself""."|1
A recent re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri.|1
Assy McGee is an out-of-control , hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas . he is a hard-nosed cop who is only interested in catching bad guys , and who believes that justice will be served quickly , whether or not it's in the best interest of the city and its residents . he doesn't care how it's served , just so long as it's done . if you don't care how he serves justice , you will be disappointed , and if you aren't disappointed in the justice served , he will have failed you as a reader .|0
Set in the Philipines , Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop (Robert Davi) on the run in the countryside. He's been kidnapped by a ruthless villain (John Rhys-Davies) and his gang of thugs. When the officer manages to escape a second time, he sets his sights on the villain - but it's not to be. The film is filled with violence, but never really hits the nail on the head for me. There are some cool fight scenes, but they don't quite work for me.|0
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. Since that time, we rate movies based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. It isn't worth a second look that's for sure.|1
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . Its been a few years since I saw this movie and I will never watch any movie with a white man in it EVER again. It is not even worth the $1.5 million this movie is made for. This is why white people are afraid to watch black movies because we know that there are going to be so many stereotypes and so few white characters in them. How would you feel if you saw this movie with a black man or woman in it? White people will NEVER see that movie the same way again!|0
"Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously.... Scott is a shady character who preys on women. In this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California.The sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version.Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", one of Hitch's reputed favorite films."|1
"At least for me . I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was in awe at what he could do with a little piece of paper, but at the end of the day, it’s not what he does. It’s the way he does it and he’s done a very good job.”

“I think he is a very good ambassador for our country, and one of the reasons we wanted to bring him to our country was to help him in what he could do for the world and for the people who live in our world."|0
"Okay, enough. Every time I think I've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that I think that no one could possibly find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual inane ""Undiscovered masterpiece"" ""GREAT film"" - I mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox/MGM/UA DVD. There are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning."|1
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted.|1
What can I say about this ? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End ? Wasted Time , Money and Effort ! I was disappointed by this movie. I can't find a single flaw with it , it just doesn't do what's advertised. I have to say that I expected something a bit more than that, but in the end, I have to admit that this movie disappointed me - and I still don't know what it is that the movie is about. In my opinion it's just a very mediocre movie with some great scenes and performances but overall, just average.|0
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone X File that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to.|1
"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation."|1
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because I'm telling you, its just awful. The acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. And the werewolf? Its like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is that bad.|1
"I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey ( like Zach , I 'm from Philly ) , but at least it makes you feel for the state, like how it would be like to live there. Not that I want to live there, it just gets you in a ""feel"" like the movie does. But it does it with a lot more depth to it, in a different way than the movie. I guess this is just a different way of doing it. I really enjoyed it and I hope it makes it to the big screen."|0
"OMG what has Disney done lately .. most of their new shows really suck . Suite life of Zach and friends is good . I also enjoy the live action movies on Netflix .. The Office , Parks and Recreations, The Smurfs . The new Disney Channel Original Series "" The Suite Life of Zack & Cody ,"" will air this fall on Disney XD. It's pretty great . I hope you will enjoy it like i did . You should be able to do that. I believe they just changed the pricing and I can't find an option for it now."|0
"'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in ""Fires in the Mirror"").Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them, than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say."|1
"The Toxic Avenger , hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly right but has its moments where it doesn't feel as natural to the series as others of the series. And, on occasion, it's not particularly funny to watch. It's also not the kind of movie I would've wanted to see a long time after its release. The basic premise is that you've seen the first The Toxic Avenger and you're kind of bored. So you're like: ""Why don't I see this?"""|0
"Firstly, this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novella, or anything else. From EW's Web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, ""...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's ''Golden Years'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception. ""The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on."|1
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport. She's in a heap of trouble, I won't say what exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her out.I mention that because one of the grievances that the Chinese including the bandits who attack the American mission in this story set deep in the Chinese interior was that particular institution whereby American citizens who committed crimes were tried by American courts set up by our consulates. We were far from the only country doing that however.Anyway the story opens with her on a train for Shanghai trying to use a hokey Russian accent.|1
"I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew I was watching it,” he said, adding, “I watched it, but I couldn’t turn it off. I didn’t like it and it just wouldn’t go away.”

In the book, “The Case for Trump” by Bob Woodward and Evan Thomas, Woodward said Trump had “never been a person of his word and he has never, ever been a person who would say something unless he thought he was going to be believed."|0
Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie . But this movie has some details , which make it a masterpiece . The story is simple and there are not so many actors . But the performances are superb . We should have seen many more of this film . In a word , we should have seen it at least three times . But one should not complain about the story , though it is short and simple . I also liked how he made the movie with a low budget .|0
"Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a film. This looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.The ""talents"" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. I live in Malaysia, BTW.Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. And unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked."|1
"""Hoppity Goes to Town"" was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's films are well remembered today, both of the Fleischer films ""Gulliver's Travels"" and this one are forgotten. ""Hoppity"" is a spellbinding original, not an adaptation like the first picture. That is a major plus, one would think. No, the critics, rarely on the Fleischers' sides to begin with, tore into them for this."|1
"I have n't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III . Both shows sold-out their 2,000-plus-seat capacity. “We had more than two-thousand people standing in line outside for hours. And it was just to see a play,” a ticket rep told me as we waited to talk to the first few dozen people inside. As I was walking away, the rep said, “It was incredible. They loved it!”

I took a deep breath, then realized it had all been worth it."|0
I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following reply: From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net Dear Kate, I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country.|1
"Review : Nunsploitation films . They 've been around since forever . A few that pop to mind are the classic "" Nunsploitation Films "" and the less-than-classic-but-tasty ""Nunsploitation"" , a movie that is now in my possession . The first movie in the series was actually pretty good with a good script and some good acting . As I recall it was very similar in style to ""Honeymoon in Bali"" . The problem was that the lead actress was pretty bad in this one ( I believe the movie was released in 1988 . ) Nunsploitation: The First Films

It's been many years since I watched the first movie ."|0
Once upon a time , way back in the 1940 's , there lived an actress named Veronica Lake . She was kind of a movie hobo . She hung out at a club where a man named Jack Lord was a regular . Lord was a handsome man who made the ladies swoon . Veronica Lake was a great beauty who had a great body . Lord knew how to get the ladies to go to bed with him , because he always had a little something special . So one evening after the ladies were all out of their clothes , he had Veronica Lake on her back .|0
So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up. We're trying to find something to fit our budget and not to drive to the theater. One of us is not a movie person and so the other is. So if there is a good rental we are after please let me know. We've seen many of the major ones here but I'd really like a good one I can drive home on the way home from work (we're in Southern NJ).|0
A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don't bring in an aura about them.What was so brilliant about Nagre(Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character?|1
Although it was dark , depressing , and at times hard to watch , You Are Alone held my attention and I will never forget the end of that film. I believe I may have been the only viewer that did not walk out of the cinema after the ending because of the fact that I had enjoyed the story enough to watch it in the cinema. But what I learned from the ending of this story is the importance of taking one's personal life into one's own hands if one is willing to live with the consequences that life brings.|0
"`` Go Fish '' garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then that one gets to the film itself, which is a masterpiece. Its a film in the style of ""Cinema Paradiso."" It is a film with a very strong visual style and very beautiful and moving music. The characters seem very realistic and one gets to know them. There is a scene where the main female character, the mother is talking to another female character, the daughter, who wants to go with her sister and her lover (her brother's friend)."|0
I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot.|1
"I feel terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by ""playing"" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! She only sings one song - the title role of an Lehar-operetta, that is really funny!"|1
First of all , i have nothing against Christianity . i believe , every person has the right to believe or no believe what he wants , and every person has freedom to make his choice , so i believe , every person is a child of God , and God will always look after his loved ones , and so on . and also , every person is equal to God , and everybody is equal to other person . i love God , and i believe everybody else should love him , and i believe every other person must love him .|0
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and alien technology. What begins as an action-packed affair quickly evolves into what may be the strangest film of 2013 so far. It's the year of the alien invasion, so it only seems fitting that this year's most intriguing sci-fi entry comes from Germany, from the mind that made Die Hard 4: Die Harder and The Final Cut, Uwe Boll. The film is the first in a new genre, a horror-western hybrid that's set in present-day California.|0
Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed one bit. He is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. This time he has a pal named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end.|1
Well well , I had seen a lot of reviews on this one , and a lot of promo always been on , so when I saw it I was really interested and so when I found it on Ebay , I was super excited . The story line is absolutely great , especially with the character design . And the art too . It's one of the best comics I've seen on ebay in the past few years , and I'm pretty sure that it will have its own following in the near future . Now , here's the story itself .|0
I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well. I will however give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti japanese propoganda. The japanese are portrayed as incredably evil b**tards who have respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense.|1
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here.|1
"Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting ""whitey"" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's."|1
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years . The script for James Gunn's sequel has been a source of frustration to fans for years and is one of the biggest reasons the movie didn't make its way into theaters a second time. Even the cast has been a topic of contention as some actors had to recast their roles in order to accommodate the film. While Gunn was able to work with some actors from the first movie, he had a lot of trouble working with the new cast members.|0
"Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an ""open"" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie ""Black Emanuelle"". It is rich and colorful."|1
Seriously I do n't get why people are all like `` Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!''... I do n't get it! It's a bad movie. I don't even really know the plot but I guess I can put together what the point of the story is. But seriously people don't get it? What the hell is up with all the hype? What is happening? Does every film have to be better than it's best? What's going on people? I guess I need to get some friends to come over so I can explain this to them.|0
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person . This movie made me feel like crying with tears of sadness and also made me feel happy. When I saw it, I thought that it will be so nice for my cousin to meet me after a long time. I am very glad she liked it. It was an awesome movie. The music was awesome. The characters were really good and they made me laugh when they were in the movies. I am glad I was able to watch this movie.|0
"Barely came trough the whole movie... Acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. Felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled trough. They even screwed up the sound. At certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. It would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.Oh and PS: I don't know what's this guy ""Uwe"" capable of creating..."|1
That is what this movie is . Good God the special effects suck in this movie . It is difficult to see anything . I think the special effects are so bad for the movie that the audience will walk out thinking the movie sucked . I mean if you don’t like a movie it is hard to come to terms with and accept . If a movie doesn’t make you happy then it can’t be really good . I’ve seen movies where the special effects were so good that i couldn’t see anything .|0
Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX.|1
Back in August , '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies , big hits like `` Urban Cowboy '' and `` Beverly Hills Cop . ''' We were in town to see these films , but before we went to see it, there was a press-conference held where we learned it was a sequel to `` Psycho , ''' which had come a year earlier. Not knowing anything else was going on, I asked the guys what was so special about the `` Psycho sequel '' and one of them said, `` Don't you know? It's about the same guy.''|0
"I 'm a fan of the horror movie , regardless of which hemisphere it comes from . I know what to expect. I can watch it and not get too scared. Maybe a little scared at first but I get through it . But this is another story. This is the part where I get scared. I watched the first half of "" The Shining "" . I'm not going to tell you the whole story . I think it's enough to see how scary it is . But I do have one more thing to say ."|0
"This movie is simply bad . First of all the story is just weird and it 's not good written. There are too many bad moments. I feel sorry for the people in this movie because they need to die. I can not give this movie 5 stars because of the boring story , poor acting and unoriginal plot. This movie is just so bad. The Movie Review

It was a very interesting film from the beginning till the end , but it was very boring. I am sorry to say this , this movie is just so boring ."|0
Bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry.|1
I watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of Beth being the younger sister, and making Amy the 3rd one. And Jo interpretation, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying Jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl.|1
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, loyal retainer Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are sheltered by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek vengeance against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die.|1
This film is terrible - honestly . The acting is terrible , the script made me cringe , the effects are cheesy , and the dialogue is so bad you just wanna slap it on the wall , slap it on the walls , slap it on the walls , slap it on the walls , slap it , slap it , slap it , slap it . I really hope no one buys this movie, because I know it will not be around long . You can find it if you want , if you know someone who can find it and get it .|0
"A man kicks a dog 2' in the air.A woman kicks a cow out of her bed.A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.A woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.A man kicks a blind man in the stomach.Jesus rapes a young girl.There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this ""shocking vanguard of cinematic expression"" would appeal. But I found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade."|1
"Frank Falenczyk : It is n't that I 'm sorry I killed them ; it 's that I 'm sorry I did not do it first. It is an odd thing to realize that for most people, at some point in the past, they have killed someone. Perhaps it is an act of self-defense in which they were defending themselves or their property against an attacker. Maybe it is not so much a matter of killing as of being killed. The person killed is often known by the killer as ""the enemy""."|0
Never , ever , have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of men who go to a camp on the coast of New Zealand: there’s a group of guys with guns who hunt kiwi in the forests, and they’re not going to wait for the government to do something. And then there is a group of women who go out into the bush and start making films. And I think it’s important to state that there is only one shot of these women making a film, in the middle of the night.|0
I've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on TV. Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.|1
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired .. but that is probably for the best given the rather mediocre quality of the film. The plot itself felt like an episode from a tv show. I can't seem to shake the feeling that this was a one off movie that was poorly written and produced and not much was done in the editing department. This is a film that I could have loved- and I did not. I give it 3/5. The first half had some good moments, some good dialogue and a few good action scenes.|0
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's, maybe a year or so before I moved away from the city. I don 't even know quite how to say I 'm drawn to it, except that it has been on my mind, and I have watched a lot of movies. This is the film that started it all for me: it was a movie about a young man, who is a poet, but who also has a lot of mental issues.|0
"Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible , I could n't help but chuckle when I watch it , I didn't find it funny , But it was a nice movie if I do say so myself....

i have a lot of respect for sharon bale. when she first entered the big screen, i was excited. i wanted to watch everything she did. but i dont really know if it was worth it. i always thought that sharon had a nice body, but she looks fat in this movie."|0
...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves.|1
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW . At least Ed Wood 's misguided attempt at making a pulp-fiction version of a real-life kidnapping and torture of a young woman in the late 1940s, in which she was kept captive in a secluded dungeon and raped repeatedly by the owner of the place, should have earned him the ignominy of being one of the last directors to be blacklisted, at least in the movie industry. His career as a film director ended when he ""forgot"" to shoot the final scene of the movie."|0
* * * * * * Spoilers within * * * * * * * What a dull , predictable book! I couldn’t put it down, and it had me guessing from page one who was going to survive the novel, who would fall and die, and who would not. I’m not going to lie. I was bored out of my skull the entire time. And it wasn’t just the slow pacing or boring characters that put me off. I was also tired and annoyed by all the clichéd romantic sub-plots that made up for all the boring and slow character development.|0
To be honest , I did never read one of the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3 , though i have read many other books by these people , which are not so good but you must give their work some attention and enjoy reading them . But now that i am reading part 3 i can say that this is a very good and interesting book as well as the previous three , and this is the third book in the series , so if you have already read them and do not have this , i recommend reading them .|0
"This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to ""explode soon"" from all the crazy happenings. There was, in fact, nothing in the movie to make that line relevant."|1
This movie was outright painful for me to watch. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. First off, jump cuts. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. Secondly, the dialog.|1
I've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we just don't need.Rating is a 2 as I wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Dull script matched by even duller acting. I've heard Billie Piper is OK in Dr Who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance!Please don't let this put you off Austen or historical dramas.|1
After watching this film , I thought to myself , they really glossed up Errol Flynn 's life ! The film is absolutely fantastic ! The only drawback was that there was a scene in the background where a woman was on her own and she was being groped by a man , with the implication she was a prostitute . I am sure this scene made for a much better film ! The best film ever made about Errol Flynn . The film is based on the life of the man himself . The film takes you into the private world of the man and it shows how he lived life to the best he could .|0
"1. The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. Ken Shamrock is in it. 3. Ken Shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. It leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. The makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like. ""Just give him a $30 mask."" ""Good enough for me."" 6."|1
"This is a wonderful family sitcom . Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms , The Thin Blue Line , and he does the voice of Screech . Here's what you have to say :

""My favorite is The Magic Roundabout, and I'm pretty sure that's because I'm Canadian and I just like the idea of magical things in the sky. Now, I'm not so fond of The Office, which I think is probably one of the funniest shows on TV, and I love that it's so dark and funny in places, but it was kind of overrated."|0
I recently saw Episodes 1-4 , and now I ca n't wait for 5 & 6 to be available ! I hav e been wanting to watch it since i was a kid and now I have. It looks great ! I don't see anyone else complaining about any of the actors , and I am looking forward to the DVD's. The only problem I hav e with them is the fact that a lot of the actors seem to be acting like they are in a soap opera. I do not blame them at all.|0
I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! I've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I will probably continue until I'm 92.|1
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love came up after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). People!!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie. A film film. So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...Modern Love. Hmmmm.|1
When the word `` presents '' finds its way into a title , preceded by a famous name , the reader will usually be expecting one or more things in the next paragraph or chapter. At least two things are guaranteed to happen in a book. First, the title page is the place where the author announces his or her book is to appear. And second, he or she will mention the bookís name. There are several ways to get started with titles, but the first and easiest method is to write a title page that is just an introduction.|0
Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen 's everyday 's life ? Is it possible to intrude upon their thoughts ? Can we do what we please to these 's innermost souls ? We have been taught to believe that the only thing which makes life worth living is one's character and not one's deeds. But our society is very different from what it was in the days of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. If we want to live a better and happier life we need to change and adapt to modern times instead of changing the rules which have served the people so badly for so long.|0
"One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many people think the 'Woodstock Generation"" remained important throughout the 1970s; actually, it was all over at Altamont in 1970. By 1972, 'underground' rock or the 'counterculture' had moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black sabbath, and David Bowie, early metal-heads and the so-called 'glam-rockers,' who were all 'peace and love' - not."|1
Normally I do n't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I finish reading it, however, the time just hasn't been right, and I feel I need to share my feelings with you all. If you've not been following my blog, then you may not be aware that I love to read as many books as possible in one sitting, and that I tend to stick to one genre in particular. When I'm not reading, I'm writing or working from home and my husband is away on business, I don't read much.|0
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order.|1
Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl ! Great soundtrack , plausible story , wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of a lost city that could be a place where people can find a place to belong and have fun. I am so happy with this film because it gives a new life to a great story I read in a history book a few years ago, the story of a young woman who lived here when it was a great, bustling city. And it did not just disappear because of a fire, but because the people who were here no longer wanted it.|0
Mr. `` Uwe Fail '' strikes again , transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap . Poorly played at times but still a game to play with friends . The best of luck to you , hope you have good success with your game. I would not recomend it. I did not even play it again . I think that you should try to change the controls. The way it is now, i feel like i got the worst of both worlds - the game was very easy to play, but the controls felt a bit clumsy, especially in the corners.|0
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as supposed washed up beach stud Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of LA on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman.|1
Jerk hazer Mike ( David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die, if it doesn't kill him or himself) gets up to start the party, all the way down the basement, where the girls all stand, waiting for him to come out of the bathroom with his cock. But it doesn't go down in there, you can see all the way through to his asshole and his ass hole is totally red. He doesn't come out. He doesn't come in. Just looks around the basement at the girls.|0
"This is probably the only film I 've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are actually in agreement. If you want more reviews like this then check out:

You really don't want to see any of these films but there are certainly a few that you should try and you can read reviews of some of them here. Also there are lots of good reviews on IMDb and I am sure a lot of those reviews are good and worth checking out

There are a lot of films on IMDB with great reviews that are not actually any good or that are really not good."|0
'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and per agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low renting rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in, and weird stuff starts happening, and because this is a B-grade horror flick, there's a dumb, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why.|1
"The most amazing film I have ever seen . I did n't read the programming and I just stumbled onto it . I can vouch for the technical quality of it . It has everything I am looking for . I believe that it will be a classic . Well done and good luck to all who have the opportunity to see this film in 3D

I think that the movie will be seen as a lot of fun and will be a major success in the art of film . I've seen the film many times, and I've always liked it very much ."|0
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas , and was totally switched off when it played in Adelaide. The film really got me going, and I would definitely recommend it. This is an excellent film, that I would recommend as a film to watch by itself, as a film to watch in a dark cinema, and to watch with the lights on. I will never forget it, and will certainly be watching it over and over again. Here is a trailer for the film, if you have not watched it yet, you really should check it out.|0
This movie was , perhaps , one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I 've seen in a long time.I don 't know how they pulled it off , I never saw any of the original films , so what was there to see ? Anyway , here are my notes , I 'd like to hear from you guys about how you think it should have been better or not better , and what it's like to see the movie . First , here are some brief notes , it's worth reading , you can get to see more at the links below .|0
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124 . It is an urban channel . I decided to check out the urban channel and started watching. During the first part of the show there were a few clips of women with the same hairstyle , same hairstyle , I mean the same haircut. They were all blond. The blondes had the same hairstyle with long hair . I couldn’t resist watching the clip. It was so funny . When I turned on the TV I noticed the hair of one of the ladies in the blondes was dyed.|0
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman , I had to see the movie . I enjoyed every minute of it . The movie revolves around a woman who falls in love with a man in the movie who is also in love with her , but they can never have the chance to be together as she is married . After they both find out that they were both cheating on each other , they decide to kill each other to stop it from happening . As you can see , a lot happened in the movie .|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I thought that it would be a great show and I didn't know that much about the character that I wouldn't like him. In the first episode I could see how this character would grow on me, but later I found that I couldn't like him at all. In the third episode, I felt that he became a friend. But at the beginning of the fourth episode I realized that I hated his character. I felt sad that I had to sit through all of that.|0
Killer Flood : The Day the Damn Broke : 1/10 : Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof . It was a tough one for me. There were a lot of films in this category but I just had to pick one and I couldn’t put it off until the film’s premiere. I saw this film at my parents place, my sister and I. I was so happy that my sister was able to make this movie for us. I saw it and I loved it. The story is not too much, it’s pretty simple and it was well written and acted.|0
Two years after 'Airplane ! ' took off , Jim Abrahams , Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its three lead roles , as a husband and father , who travels from coast to coast on the same plane . In 'The Wizard Of Oz , ' which is the third feature film in the ' Oz' series , they follow this father and husband , who is also a magician . The three lead characters were chosen in order to establish the Oz family as the main focus of this franchise . While the characters are not identical , the basic plot is the same and the same characters were used in each movie .|0
"""Tart"" is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"". Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that ends up someplace else. ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer."|1
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it 's not difficult to see why . for one , it has a great cast , the performances from all actors are superb and there is a great variety of styles which makes for a very entertaining , if not at times a shocking look into the lives of a small group of young people who are dealing with some serious life problems . i'll admit that after having seen it i was still a bit baffled as i had just read the book ( and loved it ) so i thought it must be a bit different from what i had been expecting .|0
"I 'm not a big fan of musicals , but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth 's looks , so I had a soft spot in my heart when I saw her perform in The Scarlet Pimpernel , the movie that gave her her fame. So, being the romantic type , it made me want to re-enact this love-filled time in my own life by writing a musical. And, I have. The title of this play is: ""You 've Got to Go Girl"" and I hope you'll enjoy this musical comedy as much as I did."|0
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus , a (fictionalised) female scientist comes into possession of the Y-chromosome. When she decides to use it to improve her health, she discovers she has inherited an increased virulence towards males. When she decides to test the effect on humans, she finds out she can easily reproduce with her male 'offspring', and she decides to use the virulent Y-chromosome as a form of genetic engineering to produce male children she can raise herself as if they were sons.|0
No music . No stupid masala . A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on actual experience. The movie is the kind you want to watch when you're in need of escapism but don't wanna go down to your parents basement to see if your father is home. The movie was a smashing success when it was screened at several prestigious venues and also became a hit with the audiences in the cities and in rural areas. It also has won several awards at national level including the best director award from the National award committee of Film & Television.|0
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel . They call it Vampires : The Turning. I thought it was going to be an action movie . They had me worried . The first part was pretty good and then the movie just stopped. The only thing I got out of this film is that I have no interest in another vampire movie . I thought it was going to be the next The Dark Knight because it was going to be the main villain's name. I was wrong . This was an average, mediocre movie .|0
This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun , friendship , fashion , music , movies etc etc , and it had it's share of heart wrenching moments , but not to my liking . i was expecting to love this movie , but as i mentioned above , i was not blown away like i expected i would be . this movie is not a movie with great music , it's not all that it is cracked up to be . it's a movie that had it's flaws , in my opinion .|0
I watched this film not knowing anything about it . I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. Then I realized it was an animation and it actually was rather well done and interesting at the same time. You will be glad you did. I would not have thought about this film at all. It is a movie that shows how one day a man wakes up and finds that his body is an animated puppet controlled by a machine. It's a pretty cool animation. But the whole concept is a bit unsettling.|0
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb, so even I sensed something rotten in it's synopsis I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. The Hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly.|1
Marked for Death ( 1990 ) spends more time on action sequences , than it does with focusing on its characters , and to be fair it does a decent job of this. The characters are all likable , and the story has a good pace , and its good for its time, and it would have been better had there been more action in the movie, but there is action in some parts, and it is good for a time, and not a bad movie , just a bit lacking . It has some good scenes , but just not enough to make up for it .|0
"I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but ""The Possession of Nurse Sherri"" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like ""Horror of the Blood Monsters"" and ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch ""Nurse Sherri""? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from ""The Exorcist"", ""Ruby"", and ""Carrie"" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies."|1
Before I start to tear apart this movie, mark you--I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So, I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film.To my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises.|1
Well , I have been to a British University , in fact I went to the one in this very country , and we had a great time. We were the first students in the country to come here and we have been enjoying our time , so I decided to take the trip back to my old home town to see the school and I was very fortunate to catch the bus in front of the main gate. The reason , I think, is because the bus is the same one I took to go there.|0
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son.|1
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film.|1
Dude ... I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but this is too much! We can't get back to Buffy! I have never watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it does seem like this movie is trying to be Buffy-like in a sense, with a lot of focus on the sex. That being said, they really should have stayed away from making the sex scenes look like they would look in a '60s show like The Monkees. That would've been way more believable, and they could have kept it realistic.|0
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of Jerry O' Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. Anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie.|1
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'Redux' slapped on the end of the title  I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?Well it's not too hard to figure out really.|1
Despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just for the spectacle of director John Turturro's performance, which manages to give the most unhinged character in cinema a sense of humanity. In the end, though, it's a mess and I'm not sure it's worth the five-hour-plus running time. The thing that really puts this film's potential into perspective is that Turturro didn't really know what to do with the material and that's where his genius shines through.|0
The Hell 's Angels did come out the losers in this movie . Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY was going to show up in a tux. That was a bunch of bull shit . He should have left Sonny in the tux and come out with his face painted white so the press would have known he wasn't with the boys . I am sure Sonny thought he would get a bigger role if he wore a white tux , he would have been mistaken . This movie is very boring . In the first scene with the Hell 's Angels, I thought the director just wanted to show them on their motorcycles .|0
"I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . So i´d like to play another RPG . And i want it to be the best one ever made . So why i should go for this . Because :

A new game with great graphics. A great game engine (if you know anything about game engines then you know that there are hundreds of them)

Lots of options for the player in the game. Graphics. Graphics are really important in this game . I think that they are the best that they have ever been in an RPG ."|0
Our family ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience ) enjoyed `` The Guardian '' . Kevin Costner is great in this film and you won't even know it's not authentic until after the credits. It's one of those movies where you get a lot of information at the beginning that will surprise you the more you watch it. The story is well done and I was impressed by how well it was handled on-screen. Costner played his role with a lightness and a sense of humor that really made his character endearing to the audience.|0
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. This anti-Bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film.In its campy, inane way, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion.|1
Well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even French, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. Lamo. It is also not that bad, not their best. I am A big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is OK and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again.|1
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this film. One: Okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited.|1
Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.|1
Wow , did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise ! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden the entire crew is gone ! Now , the Enterprise is stuck without one of it's crew members but with no power , and no way to find a replacement crew member ! Now I have seen many movies , but this was by far the most ridiculous one Ive seen in a long time !!! The first thing that stands out to me about this episode and the next one are the names of the actors. They were either the most annoying , or the worst characters in the show .|0
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election. CBS's last shot at throwing a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful yet I'm still watching it. **Minor Spoiler** I think CBS got the same people who ""provided"" the memo's to do the semi cut in half sequence. What is with the bad boyfriend storyline? Can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a Ed Wood movie. Who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing."|1
"If you 've ever been to Ukraine , this movie is absolutely hilarious . From teenagers wearing gold chains , to old men in headscarves and a young woman dressed in a gold bikini , it's a very entertaining comedy that is worth watching. When I was a kid, I watched a TV cartoon called "" Daffy 's Dime "" that was based on a children's book written by a very well known author . I liked that the author was a little old lady so I guess it's a good thing that his books are still popular today."|0
"I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (""What if something strange is going on?""...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all."|1
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was I right? When I was a little kid , there was always someone telling me the same story over and over again. You could pretty much count on hearing the story at least once in your life , but that doesn’t mean that it’s any good. It was told to me by my mother , who would tell me how her father was killed in a train accident and was replaced by her mother in his place.|0
What a dreadful movie . The effects were poor , especially by todays standards , but that was forgivable . The acting was poor , and it seemed like a lot of people were involved . What was really odd is that the movie seems to be a love story , which I thought was really strange . I can understand if the story was told differently , but it did seem like some people had the same problem . The movie was not very funny at all , and that is just a fact . The movie just seemed to try too hard at times .|0
Don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you.|1
OK , this movie , was the worst display I have seen in years . The actors were n't to good , but not bad and the movie was just boring . There is nothing else to say of this movie . You could not take your mind , eyes and ears of it . This movie should never be missed . The movie is only 1 hour and 30 minute . The movie is not worth watching , even at the midnight movie . I would recommend to watch only in the weekend , not to watch at any time other day .|0
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.Bogart is always good.|1
Christian Propaganda ... Lots of fear mongering ... This is not SciFi , this is ChriFi ( Christian fiction ) ... We need more SciFi not less. We need stories that help people cope with things like global warming and poverty and all the horrible things that are going on in the world today. We need to talk about how bad it is and how it is going to get worse. We have to be brave and hopeful. We are not all going to die off tomorrow. It's not the end of the world. It's not the end of days.|0
I'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. I'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because I'll be here for ages if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience.|1
I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really weren't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality.|1
I'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.In relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge?|1
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered through to the end... However, this is not a programme I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as I don't think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found the acting to be, at times, poor.|1
"This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around.His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his ""Penguin"" days from Batman."|1
Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!|1
All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid ! It is pretty boring , and filled with all kinds of cliches , the script is horrible, and there is no romance in the movie !!! The plot is a bit over the top, and is the reason the movie loses so much audience !!! All the movies in the list are good , so you should just enjoy them ! I am so happy to see you like this movie . The only reason it did not get much of an award is because the film is so bad .|0
I 'm a big fan of surrealist art , but this film by Bunuel ( with some ideas from Dali ) is so far from what I consider ' surrealistic art ' that I don't want to discuss that in this blog. In this film, we are given the illusion of seeing something that's so strange, even if it is in our minds, it is still a hallucination. This kind of film has always fascinated me because it's difficult for me to find a good analogy to explain what is happening in Bunuel 's films to my mind.|0
This movie is bad , so bad that my mother who can barely stand the `` suspense '' of Disney movies (I can't stand the suspense of Disney movie's that I've never seen, but that's another story) bought me the soundtrack CD and played the songs she liked the most, so she would cheer me up by singing and humming the songs. I hope you all enjoy this movie. It's not my favorite, but as long as I'm enjoying it, it's worth the money. This is just a movie that's just made a lot of money for Disney.|0
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me.|1
I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's Friend's House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, Anyone Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman.|1
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer.|1
As talk-shows go , Larry King Live is not bad , and since he occasionally gets good guests , it is hard not to like him a bit. On the show last Monday , he got a lot of good guests , a lot of talk and even a few laughs. Here are the best ones that I could find. When it was his time to say the word , “nigger ” , Larry King said , “When I heard it was being used as an insult , it was shocking. ” He then talked about what a great name it is.|0
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class. The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.|1
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!|1
Rating : 8 out of 10 . Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.Tennis star Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) meets the girl of his dreams ( Audrey Hepburn ) in Paris, but they never see eye to eye. He takes her home to his house and, when he reveals his true nature, threatens to leave her if she doesn’t return to his world. She decides she has to. But how can she explain to her family she has left them to move to Paris to be with him, a man who is in love with her?|0
"When I first heard about ""Greek,"" I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of ABC Family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a TV screen."|1
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow, I didn't find him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' Bruno Anthony.Overall, I would highly recommend this.|1
Although I was hoping that I 'd like it a little more , this was still certainly an impressive film. However, this film was very much a disappointment, mainly because it wasn't as good as I expected. The acting was great, and it was very well directed (if I didn't hate the acting myself, I'd say it was a great director - I wouldn't go as far as saying he directed the entire film), but I did not feel that the film had enough plot, character, or the right sort of atmosphere to elevate this from a good film to an excellent one.|0
Whoa , this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen ! The packaging for the film is absolutely ridiculous ! I was ready to hate it but when I started to watch , I was so shocked and in shock , it was so bad , and it sucked me into the movie and I loved it ! I don't know what was in the water , but it must have had a bad effect on people's minds ! I thought it was just a bad joke , but I don't feel the same way now.|0
"I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But, by the way, ""badger1970"" there are a few parts with bad language, not TOO bad, but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go."|1
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration. After a session at a recording studio Frank Sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was Jewish. He lectured them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer.Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for Columbia records. If You Are But A Dream and the song written for the film, The House I Live In.|1
it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful.|1
"Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over ""parody"" movie movies which I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs."|1
"It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Maybe the one true genius artist of British Film to emerge out of the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer-aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems and governmental solutions. Thus, his work is probably less ""filmic"" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality."|1
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film . Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is a total joke. This movie should not even exist. A movie like this could have been so much worse. You are getting the exact same movie that you get from Disney. If you like this movie go see the movie again because there is no way the story is going to make sense at any point. The plot moves really slow and you don’t get the sense that there is a conclusion to this story.|0
"One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.As nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! The cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, the one of the ""Shining"" is funfair! NB: a lot of users think that it is located in the French Riviera! They are wrong!"|1
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie , but this a pretty good one . Sandra Bullock should have received a nomination in Best Actress for this one , although it is rather late for her . The movie is an attempt to combine two of my favorite stories , and I am happy that it turned out that way . Although the story might be too familiar for some people , I believe that it will be more entertaining for everyone . I don't think I am able to explain it very well so please go to YouTube to view this wonderful movie .|0
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was supposed to do this, it wasn't like they had to pay for it so I didn't have to be a part of it but I thought I could be like the characters and write a little bit and it ended up being something that I like a lot. So I went through the whole film making up little stories about the characters as they did their own thing without me having to do anything. That was fun. I also thought the movie was well written.|0
Three distinct and distant individuals ' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . The one-hour film was directed by Mina Rifat and is being screened as a documentary at a number of universities and community gatherings in the U.S. and overseas. The story is that of a 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped at knifepoint in Iraq by an Iraqi militia. She was taken to a house where there were three different groups of people living there. She was brought up with the group that kept her at the center of a group of people.|0
Y'know, it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...Anyways, it's been a long time since I've watched anything Muppet related, but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character.|1
You know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can't look away? This movie isn't that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit.|1
"One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with ""Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/Adventure Holywood movies...,"" as if those weren't reason enough to love it! Anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. See it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film."|1
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days , Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than for cinematic merit. But there is so much to learn from the movie. Here are seven lessons that come to light after watching it, but before you make up your mind one way or the other. If you are a fan of films from the Golden Age of the cinema, this movie is not for you. It’s too bad because it is the only film by the Marx Brothers to ever become a success commercially and critically.|0
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw . The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film in the dark. At least they don't need to be shot in the dark in this one. It was one of those times in life where the only way to win was to suck at something. And when you suck at it, all you can do is go back and watch it over. I just wish they had shown more of that first hour. We didn't know who these people were, or what they were doing, only that they were doing something that was very scary to watch.|0
This movie was extremely boring . I only laughed a few times . I decided to rent it when I saw the reviews but I was only able to finish 1/3 of the film . A lot of what happens is told over in the first few minutes and it makes no sense to me at all . I watched this movie with a buddy of mine and we weren't able to get into it at all . I didn't know what to make of the first 20 minutes . I wasn't able to connect the dots and see anything that would make sense out of what the story was trying to portray .|0
***SPOILERS*** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. The cast are awful except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent.|1
This movie could have had a lot of potential . Certainly with today 's technology , one would expect real science . However , that 's not what one finds in this movie . While one may believe in real science , to believe in this science is not to be believed . So , I have to admit that 's not a movie for me . I would recommend this to children who are into science and not into science fiction . If you don't know anything about what is in this movie , go back to the beginning of the credits and just go to the beginning.|0
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film.|1
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 20th century, in which children were expected to sit and eat in the back of a streetcar as it went past the houses on the way home. The film's title is a bit misleading, however, in that it has no real connection to the story - it's just that in this particular scenario, one of the main characters was to eat in the back of the streetcar on his way home from school, and he's the only kid in his class who does.|0
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch.|1
If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical ( or Torah ) portrayal of Israel you will not get one, because there are no Jews on the stage. The Jews are on the other end of the stage, and do not even know that you are watching their show. In fact, there is an entire Christian movement, called Zionism, that has nothing to do with the Holy Land in the sense of what the Bible describes, but is a movement to restore Israel to what God intended for it when He gave it to the Jewish people in the Holy Land.|0
"1 . The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's head
2 . Most of this money was spent to get a hot dog from the concession stand
3 . How many hot dogs were sold for this? 4 . I'm sure they were sold out
5 . The amount is larger than the amount that was given away
6 . There were only 3 hot dog buns given away
7 . It was not for sale. They were not available for purchase
8 . I think that they were not sold for the same amount that they were given away

This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original. 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. This has to be Jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career.|1
Okay , it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke ( when the dead are rising from their tombs , the names of those who died are written in chalk on tombstones , the tombstones are whitened by the sun , and the dead are drawn back out of the ground so they can come back to life , only for the names of the dead to be erased ) , a very funny bit about a guy who has a secret crush on his neighbor ( who has no idea that he and the guy are actually brother and sister ) , and some more very silly comedy .|0
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video . It features passable acting , decent effects , decent story , and a decent soundtrack . It is about a girl who has been kidnapped and has been raped for weeks . The police have taken over the investigation but are not sure what to do with the girl and her captor . The police chief wants the kidnapper and rapist arrested but is not sure how to deal with the girl as she is mentally unstable . He decides he needs someone to take the blame for the whole thing .|0
The third entry in the `` Stepford '' franchise , but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure in Japan. The new film is based on a novel by Stephen King that was first adapted for a TV movie and then as the second entry in this franchise. The story follows an 11-year-old girl named Anna, whose family moves from the Midwest to the upstate New York town in search of a better life. There they find a man killed in a hunting accident, and a girl who claims to have seen his ghost. The film is about as obscure as its name sounds.|0
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i 've gone insane . It was a HUGE waste of time . I couldn't believe they wasted so much time and money . Not only were they making a movie about a girl who killed her father , but they made her a killer. How the f*ck is that any way to treat a girl you know nothing about . They should have just had the story of her parents and made her an innocent man who was forced to do the horrible thing he did .|0
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. Well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. But the F/X, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam(Kari Wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.|1
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i do n't want to pay money to see the movie again because im too old to have to watch it again and i would rather pay to go see a live show so please someone help me this is important please help me thank you soo much. A:You know, it just takes a few more hours for you to get used to watching movies on demand, but it will save you a few bucks. Plus you don't need to eat, so you can see a lot more of these movies.|0
Trite and tiring , the one-liners almost made me cry . My 4 year old left the room and ended up going to sleep . I was hoping for some kind of ending . But i had to leave this show early . Too bad , as i really loved the story . I think that it is an excellent movie. I had a few issues with one particular line, but it was not really the fault of the actors, but the director, and the production design, but still, it was an excellent movie.|0
Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin 's Dolemite . This is the single greatest piece of film ever made. If it wasn't an art film, there's no way it could be classified. It will always have a special place in the hearts and memories of movie fans everywhere. It is simply the greatest film ever made. And, for me, the best film of all time. D'Urville 's DOLEMITE was one of the greatest actors that ever graced the silver screen, but he had to be a better actor than James Arness to be worthy of his performance.|0
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent ' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana , who is rumored to have been kidnapped by a band of pirates. Once the pirates are found , the group sets off to take on the pirate's hideout on the island. They make a stop at a brothel, where they are attacked by the pirate crew, and finally arrive at the pirate's hideout - but find themselves under attack by the same crew that attacked them in their boat. In the meantime, their ship is boarded by the crew of the pirate vessel.|0
Oh f*cking hell, where should I start... First of all; this show is just another stupid American non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. The American way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example).|1
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long time friend and confidant.Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it.|1
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.Quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. I won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.The movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly.|1
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh.|1
"Seriously I don't get why people are all like ""Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!!!"" It's a bunch of junk! The acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. The music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well."|1
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines????? ), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film."|1
I was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do I have channels... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... DVD has spolied me.Anyway, I'm flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it.|1
If you're looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there, don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here.|1
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful , but damned if it did n't break new and shocking ground . what is really shocking in the movie is the way the plot is told and the things that happen to our heros as a result of their actions . in a sense , this could be the movie where you actually feel for these people because they have no other choice but to go against the law in order to save the life of the girl they love and because they want to save the girl and her unborn child , but that is not the movie .|0
"I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I 've seen in 2 decades.It made me think about why I left India in the first place-and how I can now make it a better place for the next generation.I don't mean just better for the people of India.But also a better place for me, my kids, my parents.My parents who have sacrificed so much already.I've seen a lot of movies over the years and this was easily the best. 1 comment:

I'm so proud of you! I have never seen an Indian movie!"|0
"******Spoilers within******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clichéd bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself, ""Let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?"" Yup, I was right."|1
This movie was definitely on the boring side . The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice , but it's definitely on the boring side . There are many things that could be done better , and it's a great shame that so many people don't seem to appreciate the effort put into it . There were some great things in this movie . But I don't feel that there's enough to make it worth watching twice . . . . . . This was a good movie. It did have a few issues, but overall, I thought it was a great movie.|0
No blood , no sex ( though it oozes passion ) , no special effects , but just one of those stories that can get a guy all hot , horny , wet and ready to take a huge dick . I love it when that happens , and i love to watch it unfold in front of me , so i hope you enjoy watching . You can find my videos under the Videos section on my channel , and you can follow me on twitter and instagram , or get an email to subscribe and to receive notification when i upload my new videos .|0
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while on an assignment for Germany.The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. I loved the film. Some will say it's a ""chick-flick,"" but so what. It's wonderful. Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped."|1
What a waste of energy and money . What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted as an MLS player. He should have come back home and made his living playing in the local high school band instead. No, I would have loved him as an MLS player, I really do. But the way it was done? I would rather not be on the planet anymore, than have him on it, so it was just a waste of time and money at the same time. And as far as his talents went, I do not think his skills are that great either.|0
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one that really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing.|1
"I 've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie , But Just The Half . Because I Only Watched It A Couple Of Days, It Would Take Too Long. I'm Gonna Give It A Chance. As we are nearing the end of our tour, we have just one more show to get to before returning home. If I had a dollar for every person who has said ""Oh my god, you must see the whole show"", I'd have more than enough money to take my kids on a weekend trip to Orlando. I think I'll pass on this one."|0
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable , the giant Zeus . Network President Tom Fontana is in the middle of negotiations to get a show on the CW, where the wrestling scene is one of the most popular shows on television . But even with a show on CBS , there are plenty of other wrestling shows to watch on the way to the big time. This is a good thing for those fans, who don't get enough wrestling on their television , but could be bad news for WWE , the company that owns all of it.|0
The first feature length Muppet Movie , and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol , the movie puppeteers the world over were not too happy with it. The fact that there was such a great deal of footage in that movie and it was made into a feature film made it very easy for those people who have been making films since the beginning of time (and they are still a very influential group) to be critical of it, and there was certainly a lot of finger pointing going on about the quality of that movie.|0
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them.|1
"This is a cult classic for sure! !It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want "" to view the world differently"" then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout."|1
I saw this film when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed 2 or three times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous/poorly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed at the performance of Larry Bagby , whom I usually find entertaining. If you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film. Then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts.|1
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts).|1
Normally I don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception.Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I watched this movie through to the end. I'm always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this, but I suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better.|1
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious . The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who is a member of the Japanese mafia. The only thing keeping Kintaro and the other members of his family from joining the gangster group is that he’s the only son and his mother and sisters are all in charge. His sisters want to send Kintaro to college but the mother wants him to continue his criminal life. So, Kintaro has to go to school every day so his sisters won’t have any say in his life.|0
This film is good in it 's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget . Looks like it would work well as a trailer . The only negative I had was that some of the action looks a little silly . It may be just me but I think this movie has too much action in the beginning and I was not impressed. The plot was a bit of a mess at the beginning and then it went into a completely different place . The storyline is great . The dialogue is great and the action is excellent .|0
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker ( Jules Dassin ) who had to shoot in Europe for budgetary reasons. The screenplay is from a French author ( Pierre Laroche ) and is translated into English by Peter Cossar ( author of the best novel in French film noir ) and by a French film critic ( Louis Verneuil ). As a result, there are no French words in the English subtitles, which is not so surprising given the fact that they are made by an Englishman. However, some French words have been substituted for English words.|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off.|1
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover, made it apparent what this movie was to be about. I thought it had something to do with The Godfather but was surprised when I watched the movie. This is a great film , but not to be confused with The Godfather Part II , which is the sequel to The Godfather . I give The Godfather and The Godfather II to The Godfather Part II . I think this is a great film but I also think it would make a fantastic sequel .|0
Terror in the Jungle is a real find. If you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. It's hilarious!The story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. The crash scene has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blonde boy survives. A nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! I kid you NOT!|1
"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke? ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters."|1
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.|1
This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and uninteresting story that never really got into any real depth of story. This film could have actually been quite good if it was better developed and if some of the scenes that didn’t make it into the finished film were expanded upon at the editing stage. All in all it is an enjoyable watch and has some funny moments and a nice soundtrack. It is a movie about a guy who gets caught up in an alien spacecraft that he is trying to save.|0
A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. It could be set in any town in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well.Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.The actors are scarily believable, I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes.I loved the way this film was shot.Overall this film IS a must see.|1
"I normally do n't like romantic films , but I love this film very much . The story is really good , the screenplay is really brilliant . The acting is great . The way the film was shot was brilliant . I am so surprised about the result of this movie . I was very impressed by this film! The acting was fantastic, the story was clever and witty. I was in awe of this film at first , then I thought ' wow , this has been made in my name'

It's a love story about two young teenagers who meet by chance one night."|0
"I caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.There are situations that are left for your interpretation to ""find out"" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.The technical aspects are very good."|1
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself ? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now in debt over Rs 22 lakh and is in a dispute with his producers. When I asked a close friend of him about it , he had said he has done nothing and the only thing he is really concerned about is getting his dues. But he is also aware that something is not right about this whole incident. This is not a first in the recent times where a director can not get the right amount for his films, and he is even being blackmailed by the producers.|0
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others.|1
With a name like `` 10 Commandments '' you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the Torah, but it's really the story of a man and his son, a young man who is in love with his father and wants his inheritance, and who is given a great gift of a Torah scroll from his deceased grandfather, but he can't be sure that he will keep the commandments given in it, because he is new to Judaism and is not a strict observant. It is a story of a young man who is unsure of his own Jewish identity and his own commitment to Judaism.|0
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.Normally I don't write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer.|1
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.|1
This is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and mean masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action ? Well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the Alcatraz jail. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low.|1
"I'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either ""Love it"" or ""Hate it"" movie. And I have to say that I not only am on the ""Love it"" side, I'm going on a limb to say it this my FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thank heavens I found it in the first place. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel."|1
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up. what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie?|1
OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality?|1
Wayne Wang 's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than `` Slums of Calcutta,'' and the film does look and feel like a documentary. The most memorable of the three films which he has been directing, `` The Road Not Taken,'' is a very personal film of a woman who, at the age of 25, gave up the chance to study in America and come back to China and make her contribution to the life of the Chinese nation. And the woman in this movie has to be regarded as the real heroine of this film.|0
This must be the most boring film I ever saw . The only positive I can say about it is that the actors made the whole movie seem to me like a comedy. I wish that this was a movie which had been released a few years before, it would have saved the film a lot of time. The actors are all very good in their parts but the script falls flat. The only positive thing about this movie is that we could watch it as a comedy without any feeling that we're laughing at any of the situations that occur on screen.|0
I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features, and classics, you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son), and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it.|1
When I was driving home after work , I bought some movies for my four year old twins . I sat in my Toyota Camry and thought about this. The movie was called “Let’s Play”. Now don’t go telling people this , because I would have to show it to you. Here it is. In the movie, there was one little kid that was going through some troubles . His father (a man I don’t like) would go into this room , look at the kids and say, ” let’s play, I have a good joke for you”.|0
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself.|1
I've watched the movie actually several times. And what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. Not even those silly model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... Burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. Even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too.|1
This film works on a lot of different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch it I'm not sure who to go call first--my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue.|1
"I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of film-making (shot on DV, to boot) is quite an eye-sore! I liked the script's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer. As to the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the 'star' of those horrid ""Redemption"" intros) has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious."|1
"If you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy ""You Are Alone"". It is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness."|1
"As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still going to get ""classic"" x-files, Drive showed that the X-Files was going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive, with the news camera footage. It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events. I would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking, ""Am I on the right channel?"""|1
"to make this short and sweet: i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the ""gener-asian"" of american film making. the acting was sub-par, relying on stereotypes, raised voices, and exaggerated eye-buggery to convey its message. chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry/frustrated/distant/uncommunicative asians. these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. i like to think that us asians are more complex than that.i came out of the movie unconvinced."|1
"I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through. It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the ""good bits"" taken out. Bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: ""He's hot."" ""He has a girlfriend."" ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" ""No."""|1
There are movies that are so bad, they're good. Then there's movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. I can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all.|1

"Having loved Stephen King 's novels and short stories for many years , I , like most reviewers , have often been on the fence in terms of his literary work . While I do not consider his novels to have been perfect , his short stories have often been overlooked by most fans . However , I believe he has written two masterpieces , The Green Mile and The Dead Zone . Both of them , in my view , hold a very unique place in the genre and have not been considered the "" next big thing in American fiction"" ."|0

The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went down hill from there. Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots.|1
"Televised in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the ""greats"" of the American Musical form listen to this."|1
Having lived in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula ( 30 miles from Escanaba ) in the mid-1990s , I was eager to see how the people there live . The Upper Peninsula is so remote that in addition to the people, I was also keen to see the wildlife. I had a few days on my own in my small Michigan condo, so I decided to go out on an afternoon hike with a friend . We drove a few hours from my place to a nearby state park to go hiking. I had been told there was a good hiking trail there and was curious if there was much wildlife in the park.|0
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. But, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town.|1
"So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the ""Carnosaur"" trilogy, ""Pterodactyl,"" ""Raptor Island."" Then I flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie SciFi placed in its glamorous, Saturday prime-time slot. Some movie I had never heard of before called ""Raptor."" I was pretty excited. The movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a Velociraptor."|1
I will commend it in only one respect .. it was innovative . Innovative does n't mean it 's a bad thing . In fact innovation is a part of a well-rounded education . If you do not get a good education in English and math , you have no way out of being a mediocre individual . The key word here is education and the key word is English . That is the main reason why we are in this mess today . When you have a limited English skill you can not get anything done in our country .|0
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies . But there are very few that I find truly offensive. Most are not that bad, but I find them lacking. So, I have decided not to watch any more Hollywood movies. Why? Well, let me just tell you. There are two major flaws that Hollywood films possess. First, if you are thinking about what you could possibly say to a Hollywood director or producer that could help you avoid being on their bad list, then you don’t have to read on, because they are so stupid.|0
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.However in this American version I found it to be dull, Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore.|1
"Like the other comments says , this might be surprise to those who have n't seen the work of Jeunet, but in this case, I think they are right. I think it might be the fact that he was so busy that he just can't get the time to do this, but there are those who would say there is no one in the world who knows the real Jeunet better then Jean-Pierre Pon, and I can see the logic behind this argument, but maybe he's not the real Jeunet at all..

Jean-Pierre Pon, that's for sure."|0
Awful in a whole new way , ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs -- if only to remind us what a beautiful, warm, generous, caring and wonderful soul she is. I've only been able to have one viewing of this movie with my husband and his family. I went in knowing that I might not see eye to eye with him, that I might have difficulty hearing what he's saying, that he'd probably get irritated with me if I did see this film but I also knew this would not be the case.|0
Very good film. Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I'm unjustly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story.|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap.There are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun about Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if your are the Germany equivalent of an inbred redneck (=inbred Southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you certainly will fail at this and also at life.|1
This movie had potential . If it had been handled differently . What it needed was a different director . A director that could bring in the audience in a better and more entertaining manner . I think that director would be Sam Raimi , who did a great job with Spiderman . In this movie the script is weak . The characters don't really have depth . It seems that they are just there for the story to be told . I guess that is what a great director would bring . Sam Raimi did a great job with the Spiderman movies .|0
So im not a big fan of Boll 's work but then again not many are . I enjoyed his previous work so this was a welcome surprise . I still think his previous work is great as well so im happy to see his work in this one . I will most definitely be purchasing this novel so i will have it on the shelf when i get back from vacation so i can pull it out when i see a book I like . It's not perfect, but as with all of his books it's worth the read. I liked the story.|0
Not really all that much to this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a bad day or a good day ... they go out there, they race, they come up with something they can say is going to be very tough, it's tough for that day. And if they come up with the answer that's a good result for them, they go out and try to win the race. And usually, if they do it, that's a pretty good result. But you get guys, they're out there, they're doing what they can.|0
"The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a `` pod '' system that is almost like virtual reality, where the users don't even need to be online to play, just to move in the game world. This game has been around for a couple of years. This game is available in two versions: the free version (called `` free version ) which has a couple of minutes of gameplay, and the commercial version, called "" full version "" which has hundreds of hours of full-time gameplay. It has no ads, no downloads, and no in-game purchases."|0
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week . Never heard of it but it looked pretty cool. Wasn't impressed but I did like it. Didn't hate it either. I went into the theater to do this. I don't remember much of the film, and I didn't take many pictures. I have to say, I don't really remember the film. I do remember the guy who was in this, though, and the song they played.|0
STMD ! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I 've seen in quite some time . however , that's probably because i was not expecting the final scene to be one of the best in the film . that said , that scene is one of my favorites of the bunch and is one of the key elements that really helps make the movie a success . if you 'll recall , that scene takes place in a mall . however , the mall has been filled with zombies of all things . the film 's title refers to several things .|0
I was duped as well . Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell . I was so happy with this book that I had it on my bookshelf. When I went to read it, I saw that it is the first one of its kind so I was not sure what was going on, or was it just my imagination? As I was putting down the book I read the last page in the back and saw it has been made into a book of its own, which was a huge surprise.|0
Well the previews looked funny and I usually do n't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids and I thought this would be an awesome way to try something new for a change. The movie was great and I liked how they kept telling the audience that it was about a dog but it was in fact about a child. It was weird but it did what it had to do and they did a great job. It was just a bit too long at 1hr 40min but I think it made sense because they needed time to get things going.|0
For me , this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles area, but it wasn't on the West coast. I'd like to have seen it. But I'm going to have to wait until it's on cable on the East Coast to watch it. It was an odd choice to release this, because it's not in any particular genre, yet is also a very interesting film. There's a lot of violence towards the end of this, and the ending was quite a shocker, but it's not a terrible movie in any way.|0
A notorious big budget flop when released . This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally good performance from Kevin McCarthy but is mostly wasted on Altman's characters . An excellent movie . I would say that it's a very good movie in the sense that you can enjoy it, and it is very funny, I mean it's very funny from the first frame to the final frame , and it's very entertaining. That's the only reason why you watch the movie . But you don't need the other reasons to enjoy this movie .|0
"Obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the ""Blair Witch"" wave.This movie was set up like all the ""reality"" haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately (and I must admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the ""participants"" going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups."|1
It ` s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read a credit , the phone starts to ring . How do you answer the phone ? I ` ve been on a call with them for a while when I saw the credit on the caller id and I ` m like , what . I ` m not sure . It might be something they do . I guess it could be an email they just sent out to everyone . You ` re supposed to forward the email to all of your friends .|0
This amusing , sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940 's and 1950 's stars Robert Culp, John Loder and George Montgomery as they follow a seemingly endless trail of clues in an investigation of a serial killer who may have been on the loose since World War II and is now being called the Hollywood Slasher or Hollywood Vampire. In 1940, George Montgomery, star of more than a dozen western and war movies, returned to Hollywood to work on a film project he’d always been passionate about. In the late ‘30s, Montgomery had moved from his native Kentucky to California with his family.|0
Sadly this film lives up to about 1 % of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves you with a great impression. The graphics are superb but the game itself leaves you with no other options than to go back and play the game from the beginning (which I am doing now, as it is my second playthrough). I do not see why anyone would want to make a new game for PS3, but if they did, it would be a good game and would be able to make some people happy.|0
"""THE KING OF QUEENS,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. For that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong."|1
I 'm going to recommend putting this one in the `` skip it '' pile as well . I was surprised at the number of comments I had to manually go through to figure out what I was missing . The instructions were very easy to follow and the results look good . I ' m also going to leave this review here so that others can have the opportunity to see what they're missing. I ' m a relatively newbie to using this tool and it took me a little while to adjust my settings . But it's very easy to use once you get the hang of it .|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There wasn't any of that here. When Greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged.|1
"In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of ""men off the street"" expounding on the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all."|1
mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary . in the world of wine there is a huge different between the wine regions in Europe. in this movie you got to see many winemaking regions around the world and the places where the winemakers live. to see winemakers and producers, who are so passionate about what they do is a real pleasure and a very eye opening experience. you have to see the films in a whole new point of view and i am so glad i got to see this movie because it will bring a smile on your face.|0
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. What I got was more like torture. This is the kind of movie where after you are done looking at all the gore, you are still left wondering if you would rather be at work, or in the comfort of your own home, or with a nice bottle of whiskey and a glass of ice water. I’ve had the same thought as I’m writing this review: maybe I would have liked this better had I not paid money to see it.|0
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it.she is 6 and she loved the film, some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was Eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was Jordan's video?! but she did enjoy it. i noticed the mistakes such as at the end Jordan was not actually playing the guitar, but she never.|1
All the reviewers are making one big mistake . This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made by people who were just trying to get an award . And the movie did get a little bit of award for its acting . But as it turns out,the movie was made to be taken down . And to get the movie down , the people made a video on youtube showing the movie and how the actors are not acting . They then uploaded this video on their website , where thousands of people were able to see what really happens in the movie .|0
I saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.I thought the little boy in the film was excellent. Mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this film is plain 'weird.' It's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time.|1
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer.|1
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. He's got LOSER written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from ""getting the girl."" Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car. Well, his new job is racing still, as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes. There's nothing really to endear you to Rod, even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid."|1
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like , 'Robot Monster ' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' at the box-office. We spoke to its writer, director and the man behind one of the biggest horror films of all time

'The Haunting' is a ghost story. But it is not a ghost story, not yet, anyway. The story takes place at a haunted house, where you, the ghost, are locked in a room with the ghost of a woman you once loved. And she, you see, is dead."|0
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I was not going to invest too much time in the film. In my opinion the film did its job by establishing itself in the film with a good amount of characters, a good beginning and some interesting twists and turns at the very end. This movie did what a film is supposed to do which was to make the audience curious of what would happen after the film and it did it very well with a fast paced storyline and a lot of humour which kept the audience involved throughout the whole film.|0
"The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less ""recognizable"", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose ""bar"" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty."|1
This is a decent movie. Although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. It is not typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. I would recommend this movie.|1
This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence . As a matter of fact the last thing I remember from the WB Network was a TV Guide that had an ad for a movie I don't remember the name of starring Tom Hanks. It was in the last few episodes of The Drew Carey Show before it was cancelled due to the huge amount of ratings it was getting and I have yet to hear of anyone saying it was the best episode. As for the WB, I didn't have it on my TV until just recently.|0
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation . This is one of them . Words can not do justice to the nonsense of this one . It was released in 2004 and is one of the worst movies that I have seen in years . It is a total disgrace . It has no plot to speak of . I will not watch it once . I hope they are thrown in jail and serve 10 years for showing it in public . I can not believe how many people watched it . It is just so disgusting .|0
"The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's ""Nine Lives"" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect."|1
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good.|1
"This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. However, the movie had some dumb parts about it.A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that ""J.J.'s dead!"""|1
This is one of the best martial art(Kung-fu) movies of all time. if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. From flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line. Its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the shaoulin fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts. after killing key members of the shaoulin temple the faith of the shoulin is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a shaoulin monk.|1
"I mean , nothing happens , 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... what happens ... there are so many people who go to America to get ""legalized"" , that there is no law that they can break ... not for a while ... but it will be there in 5 minutes ... and then they won't need it ...

You mean the people who need the legal marijuana to sell it or get it for free, right ? You know , there is a lot of smoke from the government about legal marijuana ."|0
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. I suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.But putting that aside, I found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead Vincent Spano.I have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies I missed during that decade.|1
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory , non stop violence, blood and guts . I saw this movie because of the hype and the hype was so great , I did not have to think about anything . I thought this movie would be good for my kids . but it was so good , I did not have to think about anything . This is a must see for all of you who love horror and action . I hope this review helps someone because I had a bad time trying to review this book .|0
"I can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can't imagine anything better.First, there's the music -- take ""Johanna"" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition."|1
"( Contains really bad Spoilers ) So what can I say about this .... It 's a really HORRIBLE and HORNY story. And when I mean HORRIBLE I mean... well you get the picture. Anyway, I don't want to ruin the ending so if you haven't read the book, please leave now because this review is only for spoiler lovers. So in my review, I'm going to go into some detail about what happens in this book

I'll start by saying, that I loved the idea of this story, and the way it was written."|0
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the Germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film.|1
I saw this film via one of the actors ' agents , and it surely conforms with a great deal of the principles and themes of Dostoyevsky that I have had the privilege of studying over the years. The characters , the characters , the actors , the director , the cinematograf , the production , and the story are all at the very best of their work . I recommend this , I recommend it . The film tells the stories of two men, one an old man who had been in an automobile accident, who now lives in a nursing home.|0
This is n't exactly a complicated story . It 's not a mystery , or a plot you have to read to discover the answers . You 'll only find out a little more with each passing chapter . And the next one , I hope , will bring me more . There 's only one problem ? Well , not really one , there are actually many . But one thing you 'll notice : The more I think about this , the more I realise I need to share this . And you know what , I feel as though the only way to do it is to put it here for all to read .|0
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things."|1
This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make things worse, later Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood!!!??? And what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as alcoholic!?|1
I saw this movie last night on HBO & did n't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep before the second act, so didn't even try to get back to my book until about an hour or two after. Wasn't a great movie, but I'll definitely watch again - I liked it better than I thought I would. I was going to review this but then I heard that it's going to a movie on HBO and I couldn't wait to see it. The movie wasn't that great. It seemed to get better with time.|0

Barbershop 2: Back in Business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. The movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.|1
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career.|1
"This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems. We also know he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots. Examples which I am fond of include, ""Dark Star,"" ""O.C. & Stiggs,"" and ""Popeye."""|1
Now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn made for TV independent horror films ever made! I normally hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the film was! But somehow I took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film.|1
"Deepa Mehta's ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative, upper middle class Indian households, this is a film no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together, they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support."|1
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club(this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans) I am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint. Afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves.The story is simple enough. In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. Luckily there's a few monkeys(chimpanzees) that have a bounty on their head that would get Boba Fett or Dog's(Duane Chapman) blood flowing.|1
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor 's planning to hijack a casino , ala `` Ocean 's 11 '':



As for the rest of you, my advice is to stay out of casinos as far as you possibly can until this whole thing blows over. It might get messy and you could end up in jail or in the hospital...



Oh, that and don't drink and drive, which in case you haven't learned yet, is the absolute worst possible move you could make right now if you don't have to."|0
I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 . Not only because of the psychological horror ( of which I've only seen a few minutes) or the fact that the movie has a very simple plot, but because this was, after all, a movie about the creation of a computer virus , which in itself is not very scary. Nevertheless, it is not easy to take the computer virus seriously. But, as I mentioned, this movie is not so bad. It is not much more funny than some of the comedies that I've seen.|0
"I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew ""stoners."" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two."|1
A vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.|1
A woman in love with her husband ( he 's suicidal ) decides to have a baby to save his life. However she has a baby with the sperm donor ( she had her ovaries removed ) and they get married. Two days after the delivery the husband suffers a heart attack from which he dies a few hours later. A few years later the wife decides she wants to go back to the husband to see the baby she had with the donor. The husband agrees to the idea but tells the wife that he can't have the child because he's not her husband anymore.|0
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths . Well written by Shane Black , the film is executed by a brilliant cast . Kevin Spacey , Robert De Niro, Michael Vartan , Jodie Foster are some of my favorite actors . One can see that they are capable of playing the hero or villain , and here they deliver with the best of their abilities . Kevin Spacey is superb as the villain , a character with a heart of a lion and an ego that knows no boundaries . I loved his character , who is very smart and manipulative , yet a good person .|0
Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius.|1
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah , who needs to find a boat for a long trip to India. She wants the boat to go to Mumbai but first needs to leave the island. She does not have a lot of cash but she decides to use the most amount she has, and asks Cash how much it would be for him to go with her to Mumbai. I know you're watching me, so if you're listening to my voice you might be able to help me.|0
"As a Genghis Khan ""fan"" I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens epic novels about Genghis and reading up on loads of historic records I feel I know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...That turned out a deception. This movie is practically made up from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring."|1
I have only praise for this film. From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. This one however changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have actully played Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does he turns to gold.|1
"1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled ""Hairspray"" but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone."|1
Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie about a troubled girl from a dysfunctional family. As she grows into a woman she finds her self-reliance, her independence and her self respect in ways that most never do. With the help of her mom, a good man who lives across the country, she manages to overcome the odds that were set for her in life, including being a prostitute to pay the rent. The movie is a coming-of-age story and a metaphor for the trials and tribulations of coming to terms with being a female in today's society.|0
"Dude...I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. The worst lead actress EVER!! Not even David ""Hot Pants"" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I NEVER watch Fox  it blows!! We totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. We watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. I want to kill the execs at the network SO BAD! Why is money being spent on this drivel?!?!"|1
"This version of ""The Magic Flute"" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera that I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have seen of any opera.I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He is just dressed like some guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVD's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one."|1
The cinematography is the film 's shining feature . Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable and interesting scenes , and he's one of my favorites on this set. He does a fine job here, and the director is absolutely right to trust his vision with this film, and give it the attention it deserves. In short, this looks and feels like a really great horror film, and it's hard to imagine a more terrifying film that looks like something out of another genre, but I guess that's always the case with horror .|0
Daft potboilers do n't come much dafter than this , but it 's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything it does possible in the first place . I'm still waiting for the film to be shown in it's entirety so that I'm not forced to make some kind of quick-and-dirty assessment based on a few clips, but you can get a better idea of what to expect from it after watching the film as a whole.In short , this film is everything you'd want a movie about World War II to look like.|0
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 ""Musical Thriller"" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to ""shield her from all the evils of the world."" The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where Todd is concerned."|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. However, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film. One well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing.|1
WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on reading the comment, please do not read it in any other thread where you do not have the permission of the writer.I am not trying to put anyone off by writing this. It is simply that I don’t want people to go to the comment to find out whether they will get the film. For one, they may not like it. I think it is a perfectly fine film, and for me it is one of the top films in the history of the genre.|0
"I can't remember the series, I believe it may have been ""American Masters"", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why."|1
I saw this originally on Channel 4 ( UK ) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression and has been on my list to watch ever since! This is the tale of a man who makes his way back to his country after 20 years to visit his loved ones. The journey is arduous at times but the man eventually reaches his home country of Vietnam and is reunited with his loved ones. He has to confront many challenges during this process and his journey is not always easy. When he arrives back home he finds the place is no longer the same as when he left it.|0
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie ! This is the only Kung Fu movie ! This is the only Kung Fu movie that gives you one of the best moments in Kung Fu history ! This is the one that will make you wanna learn Kung Fu and practice it to become better and have fun ! I have watched this movie over 50 times over the last two weeks, and I still cant believe how good it is ! I love the story. The film has a lot of action scenes that are awesome.|0
This was my late wife 's favorite film . I 'm sorry she did not live long enough to have seen it . I also loved the film as a child and have many fond memories of my childhood . It is a movie which is meant to be savored over the span of several evenings. I watched this in the theater. I liked what I saw. There was no other film like it . If you have the time and the money . I recommend you see it . For me it gave me great pleasure . There's something to this movie for everyone .|0
I absolutely adored this movie . For me , the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it makes between two very different personalities in the same person. If you don’t get it , don’t watch it . But if you enjoy it , read this . And if you do read it , keep in mind there’s a whole book that’s been written about what happened during and after filming of the movie in the mid 70’s, and you might find yourself agreeing with me on a few points.|0
"Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90 's flicks? And second, are they going to be able to get the whole cast back in time for new seasons? Seems like the whole point would be to get the original cast back in time to make up for what was left out of the first season. __________________

The best kind of pain is the one you get after you are dead. I think they are making it a point to keep it as realistic as possible."|0
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ...|1
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears.|1
It does not surprise me that this short ( 91 minutes ) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago, in the country of Poland, as a propaganda film for a national socialist society. The only thing is that it doesn’t need to be a propaganda film because it is already full of pro-nazi ideology. But still, I guess it was made more than 50 years ago, and that is the only reason. This film was made as the first part of a series of documentaries on the nazi concentration camps.|0
I absolutely love the first three movies , they were great ! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and it was just as good as the other four parts ! I also loved the cartoon , it is amazing how you can see the original artwork , it is awesome !! The original artwork and the story are amazing and I am so glad it is getting a new movie ! The trailer is great ! I am excited about it , i love the story , I hope they put the original artwork up so I can see all the amazing artwork !|0
I saw this movie with my mother , and I loved it ! It was such a sweet story , and I enjoyed all the funny and dramatic moments ! It's funny how a man can be so romantic , but a woman can be so unromantic. I was so upset when the man couldn't get her to notice him , and I cried every time the man was rejected . I'm glad she understood that he was right to stay. I would have been upset if she had found someone who would be a nice person to talk to the whole time he was there !|0
OK .... so , by minute 15 in the film , there 's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in theaters in the middle of summer in the UK . I remember it being such a great film . It's so interesting to watch a movie with no dialogue and no story . You just get to see the actors interacting with the film . I was blown away at how cleverly the actors were put together . You can tell they work very well together. I just thought it was really well made . I think you're right.|0
"Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . In “The Thief” , a group of young children have been abducted by a madman with magical powers. They are brought to Paris where they are kept in the attic of a ruined castle and tortured. The children’s mothers find that they have forgotten about them and send the fathers to search for them. While the father is out for a walk they begin to imagine the stories they have heard from the castle. “The Testament of Orpheus”

A priest of Orpheus tells a legend of Orpheus and Eurydice."|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen . If I was n't watching it for free , I will pay $10 . It was boring , the plot was not original , the acting was horrible . I will not post the film link , it's enough for me to watch this . I will not post the link , it's enough for me . A very good movie , good action , great fight scenes with the help of good CGI . It took me a long time to see it . The only problem I have with the movie is the editing .|0
Brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . Their alluring visual style is the perfect fit for all the action packed movies these days . It seems like Brass Pictures has been a constant part of movie history since its founding in 1969 . There’s a reason people have been telling stories about a certain movie for so long . It is because of their artistry . I am sure you are familiar with this studio’s work as they make films like the famous ‘The Godfather Part II’. They have done some pretty great movies too .|0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkinscreates a film like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. After they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in PunishmentPark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). I can't say enough about this movie.|1
In 1968 , Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark . He based the film on this novel with the help of his brother , Francis . This movie is named as one of the best films of all time . It won many awards , including Golden Globe , and Academy Award . It is considered the best sci-fi film of all time . It was also considered to be one of the best horror films . It was a huge box office hit . In the years after its release the film became a staple of movie theaters .|0
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''A good Movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''.|1
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon . This is the story of Jane Boleyn from a woman's perspective. The most important character is the Lady Anne and her relationship to Jane, her sister and brother-in-law. Lady Anne has many qualities which make her interesting, such as intelligence, bravery, and kindness. Anne was born in 1516, the daughter of Thomas Boleyn and Joan Howard. Anne's father was a prominent courtier; he was known as Lord Rochford.|0
Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes , directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins ' . Derek Washington is one of the most prolific screenwriters and directors in the genre. In fact, he has written and directed a number of memorable horror films. He was the first writer to write a horror film as an independent and his work has earned him the title of horror writer king. He has had four feature-length films released with three of his films being nominated for the Best Horror Film at the 2007, 2008, and 2009 TCAF Film Festival.|0
This is almost Ed Wood territory . Yeah , that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between an eagle and a jaguar from the side. And what is that contraption on his back? It looks a little like a jet engine. But there’s something in the way you look. It’s a weird look. So I was just wondering, do you guys feel like this is the year of the Flying Monster? I don't know what's happening. The year of The Flying Monster is over. The year of the giant flying machine is over.|0
"This movie reeks. No money, no acting, no nothing. I caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it ever got released to US television! Nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet ""monster""... I can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is."|1
I went to see this because I'd never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, since it doesn't offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. Her parents evidently don't care about her very much, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her.|1
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.You will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. You've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.Next, enter absolute rubbish talent.|1
"Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for ""Glory Enough for All"", a British series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was ""Danger UXB""."|1
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" or ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis."|1
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there.|1
As a Genghis Khan `` fan '' I was looking forward to this movie . After devouring Conn Igguldens epic trilogy of books it was time for the film to come out . I also had read some good reviews about this film on the internet and was happy to finally get a copy . The movie was released to great reviews , so I gave it the green light , this was my first movie I ever saw as a movie , so I was excited . The film is basically a series of short stories by Iggulden , that take the form of a film .|0
`` Hardbodies 2 '' is harmless , aimless and plot less . I would add `` brainless '' to that list for me . And so on. That's not even the list of the adjectives one would apply to the game in order to describe it in the context of '' HardBodies 2 , '' which is, itself, very close to a '' HardBodies 1. '' The only significant difference is in the number of players, which is four in the game '' HardBodies 1 . '' HardBodies 2 , '' however, would be three .|0
I hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not actors.This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives.|1
"this movie is n't that great ... at all but it 's good when you want to just laugh , the acting , the humor and the whole plot , it's really funny so you just need to see this one

This movie is not that great ... it's not that funny but when you just want to laugh it's good ... the acting , humor and the whole plot - it's really funny so you just need to see this one and you will have a really great time and see it once

It is really not good ."|0
Altioklar 's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles , from the worst to the best . He does not mince words , and it is easy to predict which themes will dominate each work . It is no wonder he has been acclaimed by his critics as the most brilliant novelist of the Turkish generation . This book is as much an attempt at social and political commentary as it is a novel . Altiok (1928-2007) was born in Istanbul, where his parents were from, where his grandfather had fought the Russians at the Battle of Gallipoli.|0
I watched this movie with big expectations . The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a good movie . however i got a bit of a shock when the movie started . after a good half hour of waiting, we got into the theater , and the movie started , but the story and the characters were so flat . the story was about how two young people had gotten together , and wanted to go out for a drink . i can see why they would want to go out for a drink , especially with two people who looked like they would fit together well .|0
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. Isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures?|1
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.|1
For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.|1
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt.|1
Let 's get right to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie . The story is so terrible and the acting is poor and so amateurish that the whole movie is so boring and unenjoyable that I don't want to talk about it because I will start feeling guilty that I wasted 15 minutes of my life seeing it. That said , there are things that are funny , clever and well done in this movie , and a couple of the best moments in the whole movie are worth watching for the sheer entertainment value.|0
A savage , undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival . He suddenly notices a hole in his cage and jumps through to find himself in a dark alley . Suddenly he realizes he is not in a zoo as he expected and that he is on his own. He wanders down the alley until he finds a streetlamp . With the light he walks back up to the circus . The lion is now the star attraction , and it's up to him to entertain and amuse the crowd and the audience .|0
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother.|1
"I'm not a movie snob. I've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here--""Galaxina"" is just substandard. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. ""Galaxina"" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard. ""Galaxina"" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called ""The Blue Star""."|1
OhMyGAWD ! ! ! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories . Two hippie-punk kids from Seattle spent two days in a rented house on a tiny peninsula in Northern California for a hippie pot festival. I'd like to think the main goal was just to spend a day hanging out and having fun, but it was also to spread the word about cannabis and its beneficial uses. I had a lot of fun and learned quite a bit about cannabis in those years and the magic of living in the country.|0
"A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as mad. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals)."|1
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. My aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.I also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.This film clearly falls into the garbage category.The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director.|1
"What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting, believable plot lines, or anything resembling a quality movie.This is pure blaxploitation at it's finest. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialog, objectification of women, and the sleaziest cops you can imagine.This vanity piece by the ""Godfather of Rap,"" Rudy Ray Moore, who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured.You not only see blaxploitation at it's finest, but get glimpses of his comedy genius, and see why his records were kept under the counter."|1
At first I didn't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by Lauren Ambrose.Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts.|1
How do I describe the horrors ? ! ! ! First , some points : First , this review should be read as a critique, not a review. A review is meant as an assessment of the quality of a film, a commentary on a film’s strengths, or the strengths or weaknesses of the entire series, not a summation of what makes a film worth watching. That is the purpose of this review. Second , this review is meant for those with an interest in the works of Hitchcock, not just for anyone who wants to learn more about the filmmaker’s life.|0
"As if the world needed another Seagal movie . Add a bunch of actors who , well ... are not exactly known for their acting, and give it the Seagal treatment, what do you think happens? Well, let's see. We're looking at three actors, in three different roles. In a movie. Tommy Chong is in the movie. In a role. And it's his only role in the movie, according to Seagal, who explains:

""I went into the movie with the attitude that it would be a role-playing exercise. I never knew what the role was."|0
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class.|1
Don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. It is, but that, does not a good film, make.Comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series being another example).The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh.|1
`` Graduation Day '' is a result of the success of `` Friday the 13th . '' Both of those films came out less than 2 years apart. The first of those films, in 1982, was followed by a sequel. A year later, the same year the second film came out, a sequel followed. That same year a third one followed. So it was that, just 2 years after the first film came out, 3 films were made based on it. They are all excellent films, although I think they are all too derivative of each other.|0
I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher was n't involved with this `` movie '' . An individual who made the film '' has been a member of the National Committee of the Green Party, a member of the Green Party of Texas, a candidate for Texas governor, a candidate for lieutenant governor, a candidate for governor, a candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas, a candidate for the Texas state senate, candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas, candidate for lieutenant governor of U.S., and candidate for president of the United States.|0
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid , waiting for Dr. Who . I would watch the show on the local cable channel and imagine the scenes in the future. One thing was always for sure, I would be sitting on my bed, watching it on the couch. I had a great imagination. Now the show is no longer in my memory. However I remember my first Dr. Who experience was in the fall of 1991. It was an episode that was aired on September 8. I had just purchased my first new DVD player, a Panasonic CD-I.|0
I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't.|1
"Like Margot in ""Fear of Fear"" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in ""Fox and his friends"" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in ""The Stationsmaster's Wife"" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German ""Wirtschaftswunder""-Society after World War II in R.W."|1
I ca n't express enough just how bad this film was . First of all what a waste of some of the most talented young actors of all time . If you can go into a movie and be excited and care about it as you watch it then it will hold you . And it should for the characters here as well . I am not going to spoil anything in the ending so if you don't like it go buy a ticket next time . I have to admit , this is the worst movie of all time .|0
Dodgy plot , dodgy script , dodgy almost everything in fact . The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Lumley as Mary, an old schoolfriend of Maggie's and daughter to the minister she has a brief fling with who is currently serving a jail sentence. It is only when her mother tells her to meet Maggie for tea that she makes the connection. I don't know how you put a twist in a story that would be so believable. The book was very entertaining and had a lot of thought put into it. The characters are a very diverse group of women from different walks of life.|0
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties . It 's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched his film production company. In the early fifties he took over as head of the film department of a small publishing company. For a young man, he had a very interesting way of managing his staff. The way he did it is really unique. If you watch his films, you can actually see how he really managed his team and how he built up a business. The most interesting thing is that he started out with no film experience at all .|0
"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"".The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins."|1
Love the TPB's but this was a lame episode. Didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has. Looked like it was put together in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was awful. The cast appeared like they knew this was a money-grab of an episode to get to market quickly. I hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me. The writing of this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show.|1
Once again , Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people . This time the traveling circus put a lot of time and cost to repair it, but unfortunately they did not make any new hole, and now the owner is willing to sell. So, if you have enough money to buy this home or have relatives that you want to sell it, it is time to take this property to your relatives to sell it for you. This property has been sitting for several years. It looks like there is nothing but a big hole in the center of this property.|0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent storytelling. Not just from a production perspective, but from a storytelling one as well. There’s a scene early on where a couple have sex in a car in a park in which they are going to die as a result of the sex and then the camera pans back to show them on their last moments. Then, the next scene is in a church where a priest exorcises a demon from the man. The next scene is him being exorcised by the same priest from the man.|0
You thought after `` Traumschiff Surprise '' that German comedy ca n't get worse ? It can . This comedy-drama opens with a scene in which a man, played by Max von Sydow, is driving to work when he runs out of gas, so he calls a friend to bring him some petrol. His wife tells him he has only a couple of hours to live, so he puts on his best suit, goes out to dinner with his friend, and then goes to his office at the Traumschiff. It seems, however, that he has just died and was buried.|0
It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes , trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more. But I don't know, I have to keep my nose clean and have a clean conscience. It's like I said, keep a clean slate and I don't know why, I'm just gonna go out and try my hand. I'll probably break my neck but it won't kill me. What else is a man's life for if it's not to get a little dirt on a bit of cardboard and go home and try to live with what you have.|0
One of the most successful shows in television history is back . Now I admit I never got into the show, it didn't appeal to me for one reason, it never had a reason. It didn't have a storyline, the characters all had a story, the characters did nothing but do what they do. And when the show started out it had the best character ever played on a television show, it was a great character to follow. I don't know, I never got into it, but I have watched many episodes, and I had to admit it had the best plot ever.|0
"I found this an awfully disappointing experience! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.This ""Felicia's Journey"" is intriguing. It has drama. But it is full of stereo-types! So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of ""NEWS"" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! It is SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairytale of ""Little Red Ridinghood""!"|1
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.|1
"The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief ( the Indian ) by an Winnipeg city officer ( the American )

Tuesday, December 30, 2008

I just had a conversation with a guy who said he didn't trust anyone in the city hall, including me, and that if I were a First Nation Chief, I'd be gone. I said it's hard to believe he believes that I don't have the experience and credentials I've had, or even the ability to represent the interests of First Nations as a citizen."|0
1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-John Waters ) : Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny bits. You can watch it all over again, just so you know what it is. No one ever watched this film again, so that makes my job easier. First saw 3/5/2007 - 11/10/10 - 8 out of 10 ( Dir-John Waters ) : I watched this after seeing The Exorcist for the first time. The movie was better, and it had some good jokes. But, like some others have mentioned, it is hard to watch.|0
This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear?|1
Man , what an awful film . As with many terrible films , the structure of its awfulness lies in its central premise . And in this case , its central premise is about an ordinary guy with no money , who gets a job as a delivery man , but finds himself in a world inhabited by evil spirits who want to kill him with his very existence . So , with no job , no money , no girlfriend , no friends , no hope , what is he supposed to do ? So , after a while , he just goes to work .|0
After a meteorite lands in `` Boston '' ( really somewhere in the Isle of Man ) , a hideous thing is created out of the molten rock. The monster is so terrifying that everyone - except for the monster's victim - runs away in fear . The monster kills the only survivor, a little boy, and eats him. But the monster is stopped when the boy's father uses a magic key to turn the meteorite into a magic key, which he uses to unlock the gates to the kingdom. He opens the gates for all to go home again, with the exception of one child: the monster.|0
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced one really good episode...The Damned Thing...it is still early, I have faith that the episodes will get better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline. The episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring, but the last fifteen minutes was really good. Though, I am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed. Please, save this season John Carpenter!|1
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off . Knowing this was a blaxploitation film made at the time, I was amazed how well it was executed . . . I've been around the block long enough to know when it was time to go and see something that hasn't been seen for years . And I have to give it to Harold Ramis , because this was one of the most inventive comedy films I've ever seen. . . The movie was the last of Ramis's trilogy of blaxploitation films, the first of which being The Blues Brothers.|0
An enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage of the cinema , as it was the only film ever to be shot inside an actual train station , and one of only four films shot in Europe to have a real train on screen . It may not be the most ambitious or the most complex movie in the world , as it has some fairly straightforward plots , a good pace , and a good sense of comic timing . The film , though it does have some clever moments , is also far from being the most beautiful or the most exciting movie .|0
Wow , I swear this has never happened to me before . I only watched `` Golden Temple Amazons '' for the first two episodes but I enjoyed it so much I bought the movie in the same day . The movie is really very good and worth watching . It is about 3 sisters that live in the Indian subcontinent . The story starts with them getting married and then they all go to the United States with the idea of a new life . The first season of the movie covers their childhood and their marriage . The second and third season cover the journey to the USA .|0
I 've read the positive comments on this movie . I assume people who were in this movie must 've felt the same about the film. I 've watched this movie twice. I feel like the movie was overrated, but the cinematography of the film is really good. The film has a nice, fresh look. The story is really good as well. The actors and actresses really do a nice job in the role. The story isn 't original, but I think the movie will be good for a long time. The film is good , but it is very obvious that they were rushed the film .|0
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the ""war on terror"" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface."|1
I 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice . The problems with the production are almost too numerous to describe. There are only a few things I want to bring to your attention. These are just my opinions and they are not to be held as Truth. Please do your research before you start criticizing others. I 'll just start off with my opinions. 1. The main character of CALIGULA is a female. She has a daughter who is about 7 or 8, her husband is in his early 30s.|0
Not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.While the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn't help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better.|1
A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life . It could be set in any town in the world (if the artist can get it on a billboard) but it looks like it’s set in London. There’ll be a bunch of people, maybe a cat and dog (I like dogs and cats, though I haven’t actually seen either). It will probably end with the cat saying “Thank you” or the cat and dog saying “Good night” or something of the like.|0
Not really worth a review , but I suppose it 's my duty to warn you all - especially since I've been here for a year - that I'll be leaving this site in the not-too-distant future. The fact is that I no longer think the way I used to think and I've come to realize that the Internet is not the place to share your deepest thoughts and feelings, and I'm not comfortable having my personal life and thoughts on display to everyone I know, including family and close friends who know nothing of who I was before I started using the Internet.|0
"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister."|1
I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. I'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't the executives at NBC have any class? I feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story.|1
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski 's trilogy , it seems obvious that his first two volumes together make a trilogy , but we still have a third book that we don't really know what to do with yet . What is going on here? Why are the films being split in three , and why isn't Kieslowski splitting them up into separate films , or at least doing something in each film that can't be seen in the other film? Why is Kieslowski creating a trilogy ?|0
"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic ""popular"" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to ""parodies"" of HARRY POTTER."|1
A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part.|1
This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a 10 if I have bought the DVD, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the Oscars.|1
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem , except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton . I think I had the privilege of meeting Buster while working as the Director of the Pasadena Playhouse . I remember when we met , my first impression was that you could tell the man had lived a great life , full of laughter , adventure , humor , and love. Buster was as sweet as he was courageous . He always had a big heart , and I never once heard him complain. He was a big softy , and you can hear that in his voice .|0
"I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget , arthouse movies . I also know that John Sayles has his own preferences as to what he likes . In an effort to meet the requirements of all audiences ( both new and experienced and old and new ) I've decided to make a selection from the vast array of low budget film making which I'm sure you can only experience at the local movie house. I'd like to call it , "" Low Budget Horror Movies ."" I'll be including several of the classics as well as several less well known horror flicks ."|0
I did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. The suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. What kept it going were the good actors.But the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like Tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. Tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min.|1
In 1929 , director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the first full-color feature film , Alice in Wonderland . The idea was for the film to be a “fantasy land” where everything was made up of colors. “There was no time limit on the imagination of this film,” said Walt Disney, “and there was no rule about where it must or must not go or anything like that. That is one of the main reasons people like it so much.|0
"I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" i really enjoy the movies. And i think that i like it better when it was made in Italy ... that is why i would like a movie with that style. Well i was wondering if anyone know the name of this movie and if there are any news about it. thanks in advance for the answers. The only news i heard about it came when i was watching news with my friend and she said that it will come out in the beginning of March."|0
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy , it gets right in to it right from the start ,it's action packed from the start and there's a lot of laughs at the end of the film it's a must have for any action film fan . It's a classic action film and it's one that has been done in many ways over the many years and still remains one of the top action movies. It has a lot of action but at no point did we feel like the movie was over. The action continues throughout the film and is really well portrayed.|0
I can see that the ratings for this film are n't all that high for this film , so I would recommend that the film has at least the top 20 ratings at IMDb before I consider this to be one that I might be able to see, if I wanted to see it in a movie theater , but that is not likely to happen any time too soon. I'll be watching with a family member and the movie will likely be one we watch over the next few nights. It is a fun movie , worth the watch and worth checking out.|0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like ""The Others"") but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I was not."|1
Estevez , Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war. Sheen is superb as a veteran who has to decide between returning to the U.S. and going to Europe where he can be with his young children. Sheen does not want to be a soldier again because he hates the war and he is afraid of another attack. The actor is excellent. His character is a real man. When you first meet Tom Cruise you know that he will be an actor’s actor. He is very talented, very good looking and very tough.|0
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors , Christopher Nolan was a master . Nolan is now working on a new film, The Prestige , and I have a couple of theories on how he might be doing it . Nolan may have started out as a writer , but his first break out came as director of Memento . In that movie , the character of Neo (icester turtley) gets trapped inside his own head with the power to rewrite the past . He can remember any event in his life that ever occurred or will occur from a particular point in time .|0
Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months.|1
A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away ( sound familiar ) , water has become a precious commodity. Not water in the common sense , though . This precious commodity was first discovered about a hundred years ago , back when men still wore shirts , and women still wore hats. And it didn’t get any more scarce than it does now. What we’re used to calling “water” is in fact H2O, a gas that can be found in many places , and can boil, freeze and boil again at high temperatures.|0
Loki , Norse god of mischief , creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers . At the center of his mask sits his long, slender, serpent-like tongue. When Loki takes this serpent-like tongue in his own mouth he becomes able to speak with a new voice, which gives him even greater powers . In the course of his adventure , he encounters many gods and goddesses who have great power and knowledge , and in the end he is finally successful . The film was originally released in Japan as , and later as . English-language versions of the film are called .|0
Some movies you 'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you 'll watch because they 're simply great.Others you 'll watch because you want to see how good a director can make a movie without ever making any money.Either way, we'll tell you what to see, where to watch it, and which movie you should see with your best friends, family, or colleagues.You'll find the list here, but as you scroll through, we'll be keeping track of the movies in the order that we think you should see them.|0
If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity.|1
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on . The action scenes are some of the best I've seen in any of the movie series so far. The story is excellent and I love how all the Marines are portrayed from the point of view point of all the men and the women that we have seen up until now. The script is a bit too slow, but you get what you have. I loved this movie. You will not be disappointed. You will enjoy it. This is one of the very best movies I have seen so far in this entire series.|0
I went to this film having no idea what to expect . I actually took a date to it in anticipation, but I was completely blown away! It's a perfect example of a story told by great acting. I loved how he played it, and how he made you feel like it was a movie that you could actually sit through and enjoy. This is a great film in so many ways and I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on one! If I had to list a single reason why this was my favourite movie of this summer, it has to be this.|0
It was 1983 and I was 13 . I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were away, but my parents had told me to sit in front of it and watch it anyway. So I put it on . I fell asleep and didn’t remember much of it until years later, when I saw the movie. In this version, the teenage daughter ( played by Julia Roberts) is pregnant at 14 years old. She gets married to her high school sweetheart and they raise their daughter together. She has to grow up fast.|0
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of all the other caving movies and it is quite good. If you like the film and want to know more about caving, I recommend you to check out my previous post on Caving in Britain. If you want to read the whole review please click here. I have always wanted to do this but I have never felt the desire or the motivation to put the time and work in. The main reason for my lack of enthusiasm is the amount of time and money involved.|0
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen. On a par with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. Then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something.|1
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years, (I loved the Brothers McMullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. Furthermore, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's direction, was art. The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool.|1
"This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters , but never got around to it . but I think it deserves a place in the annals of film , so here is the trailer and some images from the film ( which is about a couple of weeks late in the theaters ) :



and here is the first teaser :















and another :



and now the theatrical trailer , from the same guy who created the poster :

























This was another film I was waiting for to be released , and now I feel a little bad having waited so long , so I will be seeing this in the theater ."|0
Chupacabra : Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made . I had this movie on the radar for a very very long time but when I saw it at the New Beverly I knew it was a terrible movie even before I had watched the movie . I am not even a fan of horror so it is no real shock to me that this movie was one of the worst in the movie theater . However , it is hard not to be completely amazed by the horrible acting , the over the top acting , the over the top action , and the horrible writing .|0
Although this movie ( and I use the term loosely ) was made in 1997 , we just watched it in 2017. It was a very popular movie then, but not a good movie, it’s now more like a movie from a horror novel. The plot is like this: The movie is about a small town in Wisconsin where a very strange and terrifying event happened a few years before. This was a family tragedy that no one knows how to deal with because everyone believes that the story was made up, and that no one saw anything.|0
Low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The alluring Tania Frankenstein(Sara Bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux.|1
Finally ! Third time lucky . This film has been always been on my mind , but my first viewing of it is something of a surprise . I hadn’t heard of it, but I did watch the trailer in the cinema with the intention of watching it in the weekend when it is screening at Cannes . As a child I remember watching this movie a lot . And I can say that my childhood memories of this masterpiece are so vivid that I felt it was a big deal for me , so I just needed to watch it .|0

The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic ( and certainly the most successful) the relationship between men and women. (Although not the first film with this subject, the most memorable of which being the film by Alfred Hitchcock, Vertigo.) In a sense, I think it is very important to examine the male/female relationship, to be more honest than most films have done. Why? Because it is the most powerful relationship on the earth. I don't claim to be the greatest or best person at looking at the male/female relationship.|0
Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so.|1
Bought for £1 , Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Wooden acting , wooden editing and wooden acting . It was the first horror film that I have ever seen ( I had a few) I watched it a few times in my early twenties but I never got into it. I have the DVD on my shelves but have never rewatched it and it has never been rewatched so I really have no opinion on it. It was a pretty fun time though so I guess it’s not on the top of my list.|0
This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD . I loved those six movies from the Tudor dynasty, which are really very interesting. I had no idea that Henry VIII had so many wives and mistresses, and it's fascinating to see how close he came to actually murdering all of his wives. I think we'll have much more of the Six Wives coming in the future, and a new book on the topic of Henry VIII's marriages (I'll have more to say on that later), but I did enjoy this film to begin with.|0
MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood . No major stars show up -- that's why the stars are there . But they all get a chance to mingle and make small talk. MGM Home Entertainment’s new Blu-Ray of the 1976-77 season of “The Jimmy Durante Show” will include a host of bonus footage, including some of the show’s most famous and memorable moments, as well as several new interviews with cast and crew members from the series’ final year, including Durante himself.|0
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers.|1
"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp."|1
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this ! ! ! It was showing on a Sky channel over here in Oz and we thought it must be good. We didn’t realise how wrong we would be…

We started watching at about 9.30ish when the movie started and I thought this would be ok but when I got to see the credits I saw how much money he had made for this. Now I know what you are going to say, you didn’t expect him to be the first one to earn a massive cash to make this movie!"|0
Thats what this movie really takes . A big piece of cheeze . This movie is about a sister and brother who fall in love with the same woman . And its based on their real life . Its a love story , a good one , that will take you away and make your life full of happy moments . I am not saying this movie is romantic , because it is . But I have to say i like a movie with a message . That is the reason I liked this movie . Thats why when I first saw it , i was really shocked .|0
"Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out the sister is part of a Jim Jones type religous cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. This is another (!) cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if not for Lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior ""The Man from Deep River."""|1
"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then ""Prosper Merimee's"" well-known story about ""Carmen."" I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes."|1
I walked into a book store in Brentwood , Tennessee . I am not going to say the name because that's a common place I've been before and it is one of those things that people can be proud of without knowing anything about it . So I walked into the Barnes and Noble . I had a gift for a customer that was so important for the store and they said they wouldn't charge her the price I asked . I wanted to tell the manager but she would be in for a heart attack . So I called the person on the phone who is a customer service person of the store .|0
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged?No.But that is not saying much.Like perfume on a pig.Seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.He lands in Prison and is befriended by a Gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.Its good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas it seems. Then an eastern European territory as usual.|1
Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.|1
"I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's ""contestants"" are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune.For anyone to appear on National TV and blubber, sniffle, and whine about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, aren't our responsibility?"|1
It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego.|1
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad .. From the script to the effects to the acting, this movie was so bad that it was the best movie of the night. I watched this last night at about 4 am while watching the first episode of Treme on Netflix and boy did I see it coming. If you haven't seen it, I would watch it right now. This was a movie that needed to go to the dogs. I can't believe that anyone could be offended by this film.|0
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. In fact, I just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. But no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. I'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which I don't care to ever see or know.What accounts for my hostility to this movie? The characters are not believable. The plot is not believable. The pretentiousness of the movie is sickening.|1
As others that have commented around the web ... I 'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard . Having been a pilot for many years I can honestly say the Coast Guard will always have an advantage over commercial aviation. However, we will have to make a choice and I will do my best to work within the rules of the Coast Guard to earn the maximum pay I am entitled to. However, I am tired of people saying the only thing you have to do is fly for the company that flies your plane. We all have the same goal and the same right to fly where we want to.|0
"I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the ""secret base"" was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors."|1
Barbershop 2 : Back in Business was n't as good as it 's original but was just as funny . it's not hard to imagine the scene where it ends up, which is not as funny but is a lot of fun to rewatch . a lot of the actors are back too but there are some new faces this time . the main difference is that this was directed by the same man who made the first one and that 's why the movie is just as funny as it ever was . it's very funny , with lots of laughs that come from some very funny scenes .|0
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought , despite not even having known it existed. What an incredible film! I highly recommend viewing it. I would also like to mention that this is a must see and worth the ticket price. You just need to watch it a few times to get a good feel of the film, and I hope to do the same. It is an extraordinary film and one you should experience. I was very surprised when I saw this film on sale at my local Blockbuster.|0
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who ' history as its most incredible year . Everything seemed to click ; a great series of events for 'The Time Lords ; the series, of course, went into its seventh series. In that, we also saw the regeneration of 'Torchwood' with a brand new Doctor and a new series of adventures. But the series went further than just regeneration and series. 'The Next Doctor' went beyond that, and with 'Doctor Who' coming back with 'The Time Of The Doctor' we are back in a very exciting time for 'Who'.|0
This movie is all about reality , submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science . There were so many things in this movie I found hard to swallow , the scenes where the sub is being taken to an area to be sunk , and that the crew , including the captain , is in a complete mess and can hardly stand on their feet was hard to watch. It is all about real life . I liked it , the movie is a good story , but I was not able to take it all , it was very boring . I really like submarine films.|0
The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except with raptors. Raptor and Carnosaur was actually the best of the movies on the series. So I have no choice but to be honest, I thought they had made a mistake by not including raptors in the last movies. The way the story was presented to us makes it seem like these were the best of the movies. So I was very disappointed and confused. I’m still confused on why the last two movies do not include raptors.|0
"This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth . Yet , you don't have to be that man to understand why it's worth sharing , and it's worth sharing now .

"" I have been married now for forty one years and I am proud of my wife. She is a beautiful woman and a good wife. As I have lived through the trials and tribulations of life, I believe I have had a few good memories. The first time I remember this was when I was a young boy about twelve years old."|0
"""Hardbodies 2"" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add ""brainless"" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in ""The Big Doll House"")."|1
With a title like that , you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter , Michelangelo . And if it was , then you would have been right . This is actually about the painter , Diego Velázquez. This film tells the tale of how Velázquez , an artist with a unique gift for expressing emotion through paint , went from his humble home in the city of Valladolid, to becoming one of the most famous artists of his time. It is a story of self-invention , ambition , and ultimately , the price of self-delusion.|0
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped airing it. I wish Indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days.|1
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from series one, but by Jove it's worked.|1
My Mother Frank begins as a warm , amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman ( Frank , short for Francesca, and sometimes written as Frannie ), who begins to have doubts about her religion. After losing her job, her husband is killed by an angry motorist, and she moves to a big, new house in Los Angeles with a new boyfriend. At first her new surroundings make her happier, but she soon finds herself alone and bored, and increasingly unhappy. Then one of her friends starts to show romantic interest in her, and she and her boyfriend begin a love affair.|0
"Well ... it 's about time ! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that 's his best movie ever ! I 'm not going to try to review it as a ""good film"" though, because there is no such thing. It's a fun action movie, but nothing to write home about, and I'm sure that if you watch it like I do, you'll agree. You'll also agree with me when I tell you it 's probably the most boring action movie ever made."|0
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some Northern idiots come to the deep South looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are menaced by scary hillbillies, in a wide nod to 'Deliverance'; but it turns out that the hicks are fronting for a Northern marijuana-trafficking badass. This is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. The women are locked up and raped into catatonia; rather than rescuing them, the guys run down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them.|1
In my analysis of `` Trois couleurs : Blanc '' I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the other three, but what does it sound like ? It's hard to explain with just one tone. But the most important thing is not what it sounds like, but what it feels like. It's almost like a very light tone that has just a touch of melancholy without the melancholy feeling of a sad melody. But it has no bitterness, either. It makes me wonder if it would sound like that if they'd worked on it a lot.|0
If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished!|1
"This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (""will the show STILL go on?""). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film."|1
This is a cult classic for sure ! ! It is tricky to follow at times , but then again I think the movie was really made for us , the fans !I think we have to go for this one , at first I was scared , but when I saw this I was mesmerized . It has an awesome plot and also has a very good script . The story was interesting and kept you hooked for the whole time . A lot of the times it gets boring , which was a shame , I thought this was a really well made movie .The cinematography was excellent .|0
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent.|1
"The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: Good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! If you were expecting a major Hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and MPAA tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.However, if you are a fan of the old ""B"" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!"|1
This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen . And believe me , I have seen a few. It’s a movie that is like a nightmare . But it is one of these movies that you will see in theatres , you just want to take it home and hide in your closet and sleep for a week . The only thing that kept you going was the voiceover of the woman talking to the man . She kept on giving him advice and then she would come back and he would give it back to her . She would always tell him what a great person he was .|0
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of ""The Comebacks"" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks"" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie."|1
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in twenty-first century Sydney! The last time any Irish gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!)|1
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie , but I feel this is far from it. Instead, it is a film that is not afraid to tackle hard topics such as abuse, depression, alcoholism, rape and drug addiction. As I mentioned in the introduction, the film is about a man who can't escape the darkness he is living in, but is trying to fight against it. The journey he is taking us on is filled with a very deep love between the two main characters.|0
"Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson , this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By: CineMundie

In a film like this, you need a special touch to keep a viewer interested in what is going on - something that makes this story seem fresh, new and exciting - and that special touch comes from a compelling story. There are some scenes that will take the audience back to the late 60's - or the early 80's - and that will have you wondering just how did this story take place or why is this a story that you have to watch again and again to fully understand?"|0
"this show is pretty alright and fun to watch , its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really like this show because its about Disney princesses.but I really like this show and it's worth watching.also, this is one of the best shows I've seen on Disney channel. When you think of a Disney movie, you might imagine it taking place in a fairy-tale forest with fairies playing in the branches. You've probably never experienced the magic of Walt Disney Animation Studios' ""The Princess Diaries."" This is not a typical Disney production."|0
Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Source's personal assassin, Shax. Whilst Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper, and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done.|1
Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program!|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent . The plot has been revised and reshuffled several times before finally arriving at the version that has now been released. However, by the time this was made it had been around 40 years since a film had taken on a new story line and set it on the back of a bus, but the basic theme of the plot remained intact. An Irish family is on a trip to France. There is a little girl. She is not quite able to talk and has a very bad cough.|0
This movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt, Julie Andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates.|1
The film tells you to be aware and conscientious . It also destroys any and all things , the Bible and the Quran . It tells you to ignore any and all warnings . It also states that you should do anything and everything so long as you are not hurting anyone else or yourself . It also states that you need a lot of luck . The movie is an eye opening film . It is a must see . It is one of the best films i have watched in many years . You need to see it for yourself . It is a very powerful and eye opening film .|0
Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. And I have more good news.|1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80 . The jokes in the show are so lame that anyone with any IQ above 40 would not understand them anyway . If you think the jokes are funniest you are just a moron . The audience laughs at all jokes from the show . They laugh at all the bad ones too . The people in the audience are laughing so loud that it sounds like the audience is trying to break the sound barrier . They laugh at all the jokes even if the jokes suck . There's no way you can write jokes that would be any funnier then those in this show .|0
I 've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film . It seemed dull to me , much as I was disappointed at the performance of my main character . But what I found most surprising was the number of comments I received from friends who actually saw it . Some said that it was the best they had ever seen , and I have to admit that this was a little hard to accept for me when they were so enthusiastic , but I think it is a fair description . As for the characters , you can't help feeling for them .|0
"That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this ""film"". I couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped.The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. The daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.Thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting I've witnessed.As for the stock footage... well at first one...Wait.Why am I reviewing this film?"|1
I watched this episode a lot of times because I did n't get how Prue died . This is what I get . I get that Prue's not gonna be found, but that she died in an explosion because it was the only chance for her to live . And it's good because it was the chance for both of the girls to die in a way where the survivor was happy with the outcome (and Prue). The ending is pretty good. I liked it. It had me thinking about things. I wasn't quite sure why Prue was in the freezer.|0
I posted on IMDb on this series recently , giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the company, in hopes that it might receive a letter in reply. If you have been living under a rock the past three weeks you’ll know we have had a huge amount of press coverage about a film adaptation of ‘The Hobbit’, with a number of sites giving it a great deal of coverage, but not much of it in terms of IMDb reviews. This is because a film of this nature is not really a film, it’s more of a feature length ‘TV movie’.|0
Can't say this wasn't made well. At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. And there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is an oddly non-Hispanic film in the same way West Side Story was many years ago. Both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a sort of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself.|1
I decided to watch this movie because I 'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie . I 'm so so happy i watched it. I can say that it is the perfect movie. I had never ever thought that Carol can act like such a good girl . I think the movie is really good . The plot of this movie will keep you occupied till the very end of it. I liked so much of this movie. Thank you for making a very good movie and for a very good cast. I really love Carol. I can't think of a movie like this one.|0
A beautiful film . One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed . Made me think of all my friends and how we can all live so peacefully and happily . A great message and I feel like he is teaching all of us here . I think it is the last thing we need . Wow, I loved this movie, it was my favorite movie of the year and I have a feeling it will be my last . This was a moving and inspirational movie , one that will never leave me .|0
I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of last year, and I was also a big fan of horror movies. What I liked most about it was that it was different from what I was expecting, which I think is very important of a horror movie. It was made by a director that I didn’t know and it was quite different in tone and plot compared to what I was expecting. That is why I have not seen every movie made by this director.|0
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a family after his death. That's a pretty bold claim for a film about a death. And the way the movie was shot gave me no reason to be hopeful or hopeful for the future in this film. The film was directed by Tim Miller and written by Mark Wahlberg and Jeff Skoll, and they did a good job at getting me to care about the main character. But I really couldn't see how I could care about any of the people other than this doctor.|0
One of the worst films I have ever seen ! After watching it i walk out like , what happened. i have never seen anything like it ! It is really bad. If you like bad films or films in general watch it. I was very bored by this film . The acting of all the characters was very wooden . An absolutely terrible film. I was so bored by this rubbish that I just sat through it. The plot consists of a young man who goes out drinking one evening. He meets his first love. He is then attacked and killed by some hooded people.|0
For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living.|1
Ordinarily, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy stars. But in this B+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men.|1
I really don't know why I'm writting this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this:When I first get done watching some movies, I like them. Then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So, to resolve this, I watched it again at a friends house. Well, it's bad.I'm a logic person.|1
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late?While not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this film was created) HOPPITY is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I think it’s important that we remember it. There’s no doubt that it was a film to make young men dream and to make them think of what they wanted to become, but this film changed the way that men were viewed. It’s really important. It changed the way we look at the world, it changed our perception of women, and we really need to look at ourselves in this way.|0
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti , do not see this movie . If you have already seen the film, it will make no difference to you . You may like the original better. But you may also not. I was bored by the film, but not bored, and I found the film enjoyable because of the music . But you will not get the same pleasure from the music in the same way you would from watching the film, or from the film . In other words, do not expect to be entertained by a film.|0
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie ! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it has a very good story line also. The film is really good in many aspect of film making and it is one of the best action films of all time. The fight scenes are truly awesome. I never thought that this was going to be a hit but it was a huge success and it was really good movie. The film was really funny and it had some good points. This is my favorite movie and I recommend everyone watch it.|0
"OK , so maybe it 's because I 'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like a native :)

Tuesday, November 25, 2013

I have recently been on holiday to the UK for a month. I took a friend of mine and her little girl with me, I had a great time with both the girls and the weather was beautiful. It rained once in three days, so the days were a little wet. I wanted to write a blog, so this is my way of saying thanks to you lovely people for being a part of my blog."|0
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I've liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies but I'm afraid that having the other characters call him Chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris.I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film.|1
Wow , there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is . I usually pride myself on being a tough guy who can take any type of fight , and even survive , but this movie is just ridiculous . I really don't understand how people can watch this movie , they are just as bad as the rest of us . I have to say that this movie makes my stomach turn , I was not expecting to like this one , but the more I watch it , the more I hate it , I mean , it was just a waste of time .|0
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short

There are three things I will say. 1) There are some who don't like to read. I know that I have my reasons for saying this, one being the length of these films, two being the fact I don't know what the point of making this film was or what it had to prove, three is the fact I am an old man who doesn't get out much in the summer and I can't even remember when it was we were there."|0
Hey guys and girls! Don't ever rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the Oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc.|1
"The characterization in this movie is among the worst I 've ever encountered . The dialogue is trite and clichéd. I had no problem with the visuals, they were stunning . The acting , however, is not up to par either. It was an okay film , but I doubt it will ever be ""The"" worst film ever to come out from Hollywood . The movie is in 3D, so maybe that adds something to it . I hope it does because I would have preferred a 3D version over this one. Hollywood movies are not necessarily bad."|0
"When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You're in for dark, harrowing films like ""Alice"" and ""Little Otik,"" or short gems such as ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky."" All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."|1
This week 's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun ( La Monja ) , based on the novel of the same name by Maria Semple Hopkins and adapted by Alejandro Amenabar . The film is a Spanish production and is scheduled for a limited release in select theatres on October 24. It's rated R and has an MPAA PG-13 Parental Advisory sticker on its rear. The Nun is a story about a priest who was sent by the Catholic Church to the rural village of La Monja where he seduces and abuses a young nun named Sister Alba ( Tilda Swinton ).|0
Oh , dear ! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . It 's so very poorly made and it seems like an awful waste of all the effort that had gone into producing it . It ' s so bad I can't even rate it . What a load of bollocks ! I watched this last night at my sisters house. I could not see the film . The screen was too bright and too hot. I left and went home and watched it again last night. It was still too bright and too hot.|0
I wanted to like this movie . I really , really did . I was so excited when I saw it and had to see it . But my expectations weren't high , and I was disappointed . I thought the movie was really slow , the dialogue was very cheesy , and there were scenes where it would've been more interesting if the actors had acted more natural . The acting was good . And it had a good cast . I really enjoyed seeing Jennifer Lawrence . She has the most beautiful green eyes , I love watching them dance .|0
"For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better ""display"" than some films in the shoestring budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole isn't the worst."|1
I am the sort of person who never , ever watches animated movies , but I make an exception for Pixar . I don't know why exactly , but I just enjoy the fact that Pixar does not use live actors in its films . It doesn't matter how the story is told , if it is a story where there is no animation , it is perfect . You can really feel the animation in their movies , which are far superior to live action movies , I'm afraid I can not explain why , but it just makes me want more .|0
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. This film goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society.|1
"When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, I was breathless. I don't know how many times I went back to see that movies hoping to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (She became one), but she was so hot! I went to see ""Sweet Dreams"" when it came out because, by that time, Ms. Lange had become a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And she's always exciting to see.I never walked out of a movie faster."|1
How do I describe the horrors?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot.Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's.|1
I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. I am 35 and he is 17. He liked it and I did too. It still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on TV. But obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would have continued for all the seasons.|1
There 's only 2 reasons I watch this show ... I invested the time already in previous episodes and Colton needed the time out to recover and get his mind off of his addiction. It's not that bad. I wouldn't say it's good or bad. It just doesn't last too long and Colton is very good about putting his life and his recovery first. I would not be upset with it if it ended after only 5-6 episodes. I will probably catch up with it at some point and watch it again. I'm on the fence right now though.|0
Beware , My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to max resolution, 1080i in fact, so I was able to capture it. It didn't even bother to use any special effects or filters. There were no pop-ups or video overlays on the screen. There was simply an ordinary video playing at 60i and the picture was fine. It didn't even have sound, just the TV picture and the usual sound. I played the video on the computer at 60i but it seemed like there were no special effects, just the normal image.|0
As the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the X factor? This question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law).|1
OMG what has Disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. Suite life of Zach and Cody are pretty good but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place suck and are unwatchable.Naturally Sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. Its about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. There all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful.|1
This is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide, all-American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly.|1
"Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was totally stupid... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something to the effect of, ""Don't tell (insert the guy's name)."|1
"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a ""thriller"" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish ""starting"". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of ""No Country for Old Men"" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters."|1
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert. Replace Alien with a gangster who is also a serial killer and you've got something very interesting. I have a feeling that a good part of this movie's success is the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously enough to be taken seriously. It's actually quite funny and even if you think you know what's going to happen, you'd better go see the movie, or at least wait to have a few beers.|0
"This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school , early high school age kids .

Waste of Time...

Waste of time

I watched the first 3 parts in theatres and I really thought they were going to be the best."|0
There 's only one thing I 'm going to say about cat in the hat ... as a KIDS movie. I'm sorry to say it, and I really mean it! It really is a terrible movie. But, because of the way the producers handled it, we ended up with a movie that was better than the movie they originally made for the kids. It's a really hard movie, but it's a great movie, and I would definitely recommend it. But, I don't see how anyone could say that it is a children's movie.|0
"This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens . I unfortunately did not get a chance to see "" The Americans . "" I never thought I would see any show with a female KGB agent and that's exactly what I'm looking at . I didn't have to see it to know how over the top this whole show was . It may have been funny as a parody of an espionage show, but what a sham. The writers didn't even tell us the KGB agent's first name."|0
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece . I 'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD . It is worth it. The movie was shot on a very high quality camera and it is worth your time and money to watch this movie in theaters . GIRL IN THE HALLOWEEN MOVIE IS THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS MIRROR . THIS IS THE VERY FIRST MOVIE ABOUT THE CAST OF CHRISTIANS WHO BURNED CHRISTMAS . IT IS A FAIRY TALE OF A SAD CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY . I WOULD NOT GO TO CHRISTMAS AGAIN WITHOUT WATCHING THIS FILM ! I am sure you will feel the same way.|0
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic movie, it is Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a bible thumping Christian or a Mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way.|1
"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves (""You loved her?""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner."|1
"I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I purchased and read the book ""Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds"". And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight."|1
"I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."""|1
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun : a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a young man and dies before she can tell him she likes him, the young man comes to her funeral to ask her to be his girlfriend. But it isn’t fun at all. I’ve never seen this movie but the trailer makes it sound even better than what I have seen in my life. I guess I’m just waiting for the moment where I will be so happy to see this movie that I’ll start crying.|0
`` What Alice Found '' is the greatest movie that nobody 's ever heard of ! I underestimated it when I was in high school. It was so over-the-top unbelievable that it's no wonder it never became popular. Yet, when you watch the movie, you can see why it would have appealed to a small group of teenagers. In the movie, a group of boys are gathered to watch the final performance by a ballet company. It's their senior year, and their friends have gotten them to thinking they'll all go into the performing arts.|0
When this series aired I watched most of it . I think it was supposed to be a long running series that aired for 2 seasons. The episodes were very short. The episodes seemed to change often and were never consistent. Here’s another thing. When I watch a movie I go into it with expectations and sometimes I get disappointed when it does not live up to them. On the other hand there are the times when the movie works out of its own accord. When this series was on, I thought it was supposed to be like that.|0
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof , or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. I can't think of a better movie to see on a Tuesday night than this one, so I am going to see it for the first time on Wednesday. I think it'll have me chuckling in every scene. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the ending, but it did make me laugh so I'll take that. There will be more spoilers. I'll get to that after the movie ends.|0
"I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur. Her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to ""get away"" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny."|1
Surprisingly well-acted , well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom : his favorite heavy metal band are about to open for him and he gets to go. He also gets to go to an old school and hang out with a former teacher and his old girlfriend, who's now his fiancé. His band mates also get to go. He's about to go on tour and do a gig, but his dad's dying. He meets a girl out there, and he and her go to an underground club.|0
28 years before 9/11 , there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile , because of the number of casualties. This morning we woke up to news that another 9/11 was planned. The attack would have been carried out by suicide bombers on a passenger plane. The attack could have been much worse. The plane had already taken off when it was shot down, but none of the passengers died or was seriously hurt. Instead of being shot down by a gun, as had been the plan, the bomb was a pressure cooker device which was strapped to the plane.|0
I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of animation, while certainly attractive, could be very distracting at certain times. I will say, however, that I was not entirely happy with the music. I also really enjoyed the voice actors' performances - especially the singing voice, which is what drew me in. The voice actors did a decent job, but it's the voice acting that made me love the movie. There's a reason it's one of my top favorites of all time, and one of my favorites from this year.|0
Not the best of the WIP 's , but not the worst either . I honestly feel guilty laughing at something that I have been laughing at for the last few months . And in the same sense of guilt I feel when I see something that I used to laugh at or laugh at. I don't feel like laughing anymore , it just makes me sick . So it's time to laugh again . So I have finally gotten it all together and finished it. This is what I've come up with so far. If you are interested please let me know.|0
"From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy ""beginning of time"" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth!"|1
"Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic ""Godfather"" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded."|1
Two years after this movie was made , `` The Juror '' came out . Do n't waste your time. The movie is based on a real-life case in New York between two African-Americans . One of them was convicted of raping a white woman on a subway train after she rejected his invitation to meet at a hotel . The woman testified that she was wearing only a towel when they met . The defense lawyer was able to convince the jury that she was lying by claiming that the two men in the hotel room with them had made it clear they wanted to make love and not have sex .|0
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan, I have to say that this film while not awful, just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out...If you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the Swedish tundra...I am so disappointed...|1
"This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, ""Rolling Kansas"" is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie."|1
Overall , a well done movie . There were the parts that made me wince , and there were the parts that made me cheer . The whole movie was quite an experience and I'll be back for more . I didn't expect much from this film , but it surpassed all my expectations, and that was a rare good thing in my book . It's a great flick , and the story and acting are superb . That's quite rare , in fact, in these times , and I applaud them for that . If you want to enjoy a good movie , go see it .|0
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. Rene is FINE!!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone forward me his contact info?My friend thinks Flex is the finer of the two. She's been a Flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. The cousins were funny and just as trifling as Nana described them. LOL.I am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.|1
For connoisseurs of bad movies , Galaxina is a true gem . With truly horrid dialog , acting , and a plot that is so bad it's funny , Galaxina is probably the single most unpleasant movie you will ever see . A movie so bad in fact it was actually banned in Japan , a fact that I'm not sure is ever going to get the credit it's due for being a true movie-gone-bad . This is a story about an orphaned kid and an old blind woman that lives in his basement , and a man named Galaxina .|0
"I watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to some light reading ""Lobotomy for Beginners"".It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century."|1
Something of a disappointment . Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York . His company makes $100 a day working under a union contract, and he doesn't really give a damn what the union does or doesn't do . . . except when it happens to affect him. Then he has to make some decisions that are more important . . . than the company or the Union . . . . and this is where my story starts. It starts in the spring of 1957, when I was 17 years old, and a junior at Harvard Law School .|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
"If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you're hoping for another ""Vidocq""...well look elsewhere. It does have the same kind of story like The Mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as I was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor."|1
This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . Unhappy 'easterners ' are not pleased with the way the film is going to be edited so that the western audience sees the movie as if it was made by them . There is nothing else for it . If you have not read or seen ' A Passage to India ' or not even watched it , then this will not interest you and you will have to stop watching and reading . I do not want to offend anybody and I cannot see how such a movie can be made with so much love , humour , and pathos .|0
This movie was bad on so many levels. The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable. It's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie. I mean if anyone has seen any of the Police Academy movies, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His Character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from Characters i have seen him play before, so that was a plus. And I did think that Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie.|1
Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. When in theory we should be watching for the narrative.The plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!|1
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid plotline, and the ever-predictable outcome. About the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women (and the mute guy for you ladies) in it. The leader of the warrior women and Valeria are quite appealing to the eye. But that's about all this movie has going for it.Some silliness in point: One scene, when they start to journey to the lair of the Dark One, they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land.|1
I caught this on HBO under its category of `` Guilty Pleasures '' , and I would agree that I did not enjoy it much. However, the movie is worth a viewing and I think it should be seen by everyone, especially if you have time to watch the whole film. The film is one of those where you start at the beginning and try to figure out what the film is about. It's a bit confusing at times. The director does not give us any background on his film nor does he tell us what has happened.|0
TART is the worst movie I 've seen this year , and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and THE WICKERKING PRINCESS, so this review isn't going out of my way to defend or praise it. It isn't bad, it's just awful and it has an awful script that I can't quite remember what the film was about. As I'm writing this review, I can only come up with one possible explanation and that is that the author of this film is having a rough day and couldn't figure out what to make of this story and decided to try something totally different.|0
"Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable."|1
Just a great soundtrack . Really enjoyable music . Outstanding cast , great lead performance . Worth watching.Does n't really take itself that serious . But i can see that it would have been a great film had the lead character had a sense of humor and not take himself too seriously all the time .Great movie . The movie is set in New York City in the 30's . There is a lot going on in this movie that is going to bring a lot of laughs . It really brings back a lot of memory's when i was a teenager . The cast is really good .|0
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found it impossible to get a good answer from google. I guess the question I want to know is how was this film made? Can anyone provide a few details about the story line? I have found out that this film was released by Roxy Films, but I still cannot figure out how to obtain a good answer from google. I guess this would be a really easy film to find since it is a French language film. Thanks in advance guys.|0
Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh ( Min-Sik Choi ) is bailed out of a bar fight by his friends. When he shows up to meet his girlfriend, he finds his fiancee is with another man, and that the fiance is not in the least bit remorseful for it. Later that night, after the wedding is over, Oh finds out his fiancée has an illegitimate daughter, so he sends her to the country and sends her home with the money from his father's inheritance. The daughter is happy to be with him, and he decides to adopt her.|0
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the American Film Institute in Beverly Hills. Tarantino had directed it, but it wasn't yet a movie. I was in my mid-twenties and a bit of a movie-hoarder, but he showed me a movie that had already earned some serious kudos for itself in the mainstream press and that I would have been a fool not to see. I didn't. A few years later, the film would be nominated for three Oscars and earn Tarantino a Best Director nomination for his work here.|0
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years. It struck home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson/Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How large the real table was on which Treat danced. How driven the wizard behind the curtain.|1
"""Graduation Day"" is a result of the success of ""Friday the 13th."" Both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film, I'd recommend ""Graduation Day."" If not, I wouldn't. There's nothing new here, just the same old killings.Even though I've given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say that it's not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative."|1
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper . Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies . but when a movie like this come along . I can’t help but get emotionally involved . You know when you go to the movies with your best friend and the next day you are so sad because you didn’t see the movie . Like this movie . I saw a movie that made me cry . And I realized something . I have a lot of movies that makes me cry now . But if I had a little more time .|0
Okay,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him/her but think a little less. This is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. THis is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. The only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is over an the top, nonstop, laugh your rear end off it is so stupid, badly made movie.|1
The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. But the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. And, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers filmed mostly in Russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability.|1
I've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it.I'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. That being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away.|1
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film.|1
"I don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe I will in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the ""chemistry"" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie....and have the DVD on order!"|1
This is a poor , poor movie . Full of clichés , unrealistic moments : punching the air in celebration of someone getting in the car , getting shot with a shotgun , taking a phone call on a public phone , going to the bathroom in a public restroom . not to mention , it's a waste of time . The story , if there is one , is an excuse to have the cast in a bar . We all know it is a stupid excuse , but then it goes on to explain what happened .|0
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden , then we should take this stinker down. We can’t do this with a drone strike, or we risk the loss of life to civilians in a strike which turns out to be a fake. We also need to understand that the Pakistani government has given the Taliban a green light to attack India on a large scale. And the US and Pakistan have to work out some kind of cease fire agreement to take pressure off the Taliban and ensure a more stable situation for the Indian people.|0
Ben Affleck , about to be married , is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the most complicated cases in law enforcement. I’m always a big believer that we need more films that tell us what happens in the world, that give us the chance to see how law and order work, and to learn from the experiences of those who are in law enforcement. I think that there is no doubt that the most important aspect of law and order is good police work. And that is not a new thing.|0
"Do n't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one . It is , but it also has its flaws and that is why you will find it very interesting , I think. I enjoyed it. I think that's what they were going for. In the end it's just a ""what if"" adventure film. I think that's all I'm going to say about this. It was very well written. The dialog was great. The story wasn't really that bad. I felt like the whole movie had an amazing story and plot."|0
The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised : Good campy fun with lots of laughs for the family. The only down side to this movie is that it's not the full length version of the movie, it only ends up a little over 2hrs when you add in a 15 min intermission. As I said in the movie itself it is very family friendly for those who want to watch a 3 hour movie. However if your kids are under 10 or you want to watch it with the family and have a short 2 hour time, I'd pick up the 2hrs version.|0
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fast forward was I able to make it through the first 2 hours. The write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but I didn't see much of either. If it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt that I will watch the rest without a recommendation.This review is supposed to be without spoilers so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic.|1
"^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap . Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for , its all like ""its good for the character , they need to get this out of their system"" . I couldnt give a fuck if it was a movie or a tv series , i just dont wanna waste my time with a movie with no plot or characters . I hate that shit . . . Its like when they release a new book and they have like 2 pages in it with no story in it ."|0
While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years , there have always been rivals to their success like Toon Boom , Tipp-Ex , Film Roman , Topps and many other animation studios that have been making some of the best animation ever seen on this planet. When it comes to anime , animation , cartoons , kids and comics , Disney is by far the king. However , to be a good animation studio , you need more than just great story lines and good animation to make you a good animation studio.|0
I must say , when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site , I figured it was going to be awful . however , it does have a few decent points and is not terrible . this is a film i have never seen , but i have heard of the plot , and it sounds like i may just have to see it . let's first look at what makes this a very good film . i will talk about it , and then the rest , shall we ? . first of all , i will be honest , i hated the film .|0
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited, roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it is Disney, you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer.|1
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * There 's not much that can ruin the fun of watching a horror film. There 's only one exception, though, and it happens during the last few minutes. The exception is the moment you realize that the killer is right there, right in front of you, stalking you. You don't have a gun, you don't have the power to change things, you just have to let the monster do its thing. You can't fight it, you know. But you can watch it.|0
"I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view. I was sorely disappointed. From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it any more obvious? If that is the intended ""twist"" in this film, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem."|1
I tried watching this movie , but I did n't make it past the first 15 minutes . It 's a great film , but it is only worth watching if you are a fan of John Wayne . It 's not as good a film as the original , but still has great action scenes , and is a good western . This is my favorite film of the bunch . I think the only reason it doesn't get a perfect rating is because it's a remake . I had a similar experience watching the first film. It was good enough, but not good enough.|0
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen . The visuals were so dang choppy it made me wonder what the hell is wrong with this picture . It was like watching a TV show that ran for a few minutes before the picture turned to a mess and you had to sit down to see what was happening and get it out . And when the action finally came back to the screen , I couldn't believe the resolution . I really enjoyed this TV movie . I have to say it would have been more interesting to see it as a TV movie than as a live-action movie.|0
Here is a movie of adventure , determination , heroism , & bravery . Plus , it 's set back in the early 1900's . I 've seen many movies of this genre but this one takes the cake . It's not just the story itself , it 's how a bunch of boys get their hands on a golden opportunity . It's also a good movie to see when it comes on in your neighborhood . If you haven't yet see this movie , do yourself the favor to go out , rent the dvd , and enjoy .|0
Until today , I thought there only three people , including me , who considered Heaven 's Gate ( 1980 - 1983 ) as their favorite band . Not anymore . After spending a week with my family , I decided to re-visit this obscure band . I discovered that my family had never heard of any of its previous members , nor had they ever had anything to do with any of its previous releases . That 's how I had never heard of this band , nor of its members . I thought I'd better go back and listen to their early work , in order to get my bearings .|0
I 've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I 've found him to be nothing short of a fraud. In all seriousness, I 'll be the first to admit to the fact that there are many who 're more accomplished than I in the art of photography, but I 've also come to realize that the majority of them simply aren 't talented enough to be considered genuine masters. In other words , they 're not the kind of man who is truly capable of creating masterpieces. That 's a real shame because the world would surely benefit from more masterpieces.|0
I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that's all I can say...Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazyI cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that's all I can say...Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...p.s.|1
While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests.|1
Poor Bela Lugosi . Just another day at work . A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war machine . They have been successful for a number of years . The government now has a number of programs that have been created by these saboteurs . This program is designed to allow the government to keep the country in a state of constant war . The government is very excited about how successful this is . I’m sure you’ve been waiting a long time to hear the story . The program is called Operation Northwoods . Now this is a very interesting story .|0
Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch ? Just think how many fans of the films are waiting to watch it with their children so they can say that she was not real. There are so many characters in the film and so few of them are memorable. They just seem to be there so that we will want to see the movie again in a month when it has been over for two years and we will be bored with all of them. The acting in the film is very average.|0
I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . I don´t know but maybe it is in part that´s why people are not looking back at it . It seems as if they can´t keep it up . It seems like the last time they were on the air was in the early 90´s so it´s time that it is on the air and that it is done with . It´s a good program and a good show with good actors . But I think it´s time they left . They are getting old and I think they are just a little too in depth for me .|0
I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it.|1
I 've rent the movie because i 'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i 've seen in that film it was a war and there was a girl in it who was just like to me and i thought about the fact that her and me, we have the same problem we both have the same face and we both want something which we can 't have it . and i thought about the fact that the only thing we can have is each other 's love and to give each other the chance to have the same love we both want it is not something easy .|0
This is one of the funniest movies I 've ever saw . A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an amazing screenplay about a girl and her boyfriend . It has been a long, long time since I have watched a movie . In my life I have only seen a couple of films . The first movie I have seen was The Good, the Bad , the Ugly . This movie was the best movie I ever watched . So many people think this movie is bad . But in my life I've only seen one movie that was more like a movie .|0
When i went to see this i thought , i liked the first two and thought that they were very good but as i got to listen to the 3rd one. I loved it. This is one of the best albums ever! It is the best thing since sliced bread. So many songs. I had to listen to the whole album again to make sure I could remember everything. And there's the whole album. It's hard to describe it, but it's a great album in all ways. This is one of the best albums i have heard in a very long time.|0
The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic (and, in some respects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives.|1
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO . It is of my opinion that this movie was excellent. I do agree with you that they should have done a follow up movie so we could have see more of the main characters in a more action packed movie. The acting was superb and all of the actors should be recognized as some of the best actors at that time. This movie is not just a fantasy movie, it had a dark under side that was amazing to watch . The music was great too . I would like to watch the movie again .|0
Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie . She wears her hair in a buzz cut, has a sexy tattoo on her back and has a nice pair of natural tits. You’ve never seen anything like this before! When she shows up for her interview for work, we get to see her in all her naked glory before she gets her clothes off and strips! She shows off her sexy body and tits while getting naked, and her sexy attitude is just great! We get to see a bit more of her when she strips down to her birthday suit.|0
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal.|1
"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches. ""Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."|1
Reanhauer ( Bill Roy ) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, and then discovers she’s still alive and has fallen under the cult’s control. He then has to figure out how to find and rescue her. With the aid of his faithful dog, he’s forced to overcome his fear of his own people. The film plays like an ’80s sci-fi epic. It’s got some cool action, but at the end I’m left feeling like I haven’t been treated to everything that made me interested in this genre of film.|0
Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema . Here is one good example where Aaran goes wrong in all the aspects . Aaran is actually the story of an orphan who had no family to call him as his mother died when he was just 4 . Aaran is the son of the poor farmer who had left the country when he was in his childhood to escape his poverty . And here in one scene Aaran finds a job as a nanny for a rich man . Aaran comes back to India and takes care of the family of his nanny .|0
This is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic, big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.I couldn't believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed.|1
Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.|1
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki- bashing in the film, this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki- bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music.|1
"I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. ""one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)"", shocking"", and "" a must have "".Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting."|1
"Forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? A dial up internetconnection? Clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures (""He!"|1
... but you probably have seen it or else you would n't be here . It 's so obscure that most people who do not know this story don't know of it . I was lucky because I was one of the few people who did in fact see it. My father was very proud of me and my mother was very pleased that someone had seen it. I never got it on film. It was in black and white but I still remember the feeling that it made me. It's the story of a small town and the people who lived there .|0
"The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and the priest who took care of her is subsequently killed in return, but he doesn't know it's her until he gets a letter from the police saying that she has died. After a few weeks, the priest finds out. And he decides to end the revenge on himself by killing the nun. In one of the sequels to ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the woman who killed the nun is killed in return."|0
"Ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...This one stars Jaqueline Lovell(sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in ""Femalien"", ""The Erotic House of Wax"", and that family favorite ""Nude Bowling Party"". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. ""Head of the Family"" actually tries to be a real moovie. A con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed."|1
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England . It is a tale of sex , drugs , crime , violence and general stupidity , but it’s funny and it’s fun . There are no real villains . There are no real heroes . There are only people , and the people aren’t the heroes . It is a comedy set against the background of the early Eighties , a time when cocaine was legal, when people were buying up houses by the mile for £5 million , and when the police were trying to do something about it .|0
Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption. It has also become one of the most frequently remade in recent years, for a wide range of different reasons . After the success of this film, there were plans in the UK for a remake, which never came to light . In the 1970s, Sellers and his son, Peter Sellers Jr, created a series of commercials for British drug company Gilead and a short film entitled ' The Doctor is Back , which they released on the BBC. .|0
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be?|1
"Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. I only watched ""Golden Temple Amazons"" yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers  especially Jess Franco ones  and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences."|1
"Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America , and a reputation for making movies both popular and interesting. But at the start of the movie-making revolution in the early 2000s he was just making his name. ""I didn't know what I was good at,"" he says now of his youth, when he was in his early 20s, ""and I was doing nothing."" He had only a few movies to his name by that point, but ""I felt I had more than that to give,"" as he says."|0
Sorry about the `` extremely clever '' summary phrase . I do n't know what I was thinking , but I certainly didn't mean to offend you. Sorry. Anyway I was looking at the various options available for the ``solar'' part of the title of this piece and I decided on my own and I don't have any links to where I looked and decided on this. It just seemed to be the best possible word to use. Sorry again. I just wanted to make sure I spelled my name right.|0
I left the theater , and I was only 10 years old . That 's how bad it sucked . I'm not sure how to fix it . I want to see it again and again . I'm glad it didn't do well at the box office . But this is the first I've had to put up with a musical in the theater since . . . it was . . . I forget the name . . . Well, it's not the first time that I've been in trouble with a live show. But, I've learned to live with it.|0
"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids!"|1
After watching Stop-Loss , I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker . Gone are the days when you just need a good story to make it to the screen. It's the story that matters now, with the story-driven films getting the biggest share of the box office, with blockbusters becoming a rarity. That's why I decided to write this blog , because in this post , I'd like to address two things: (1) What makes a great story? (2) Will the story you choose to tell still have the power to leave you happy and entertained?|0
I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films . Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in the local cinema . They’ll get the biggest reaction out of the audiences in a crowd of people . And most of all they will make you feel something . You’ll never go home and you will feel good. As for this blog, i’m not really into writing. It’s because i have so much things to read. And it’s not always good to read on the net because i’m not really interested in the content of what i get.|0
When I stepped into the theater , I thought this was going to be a great movie . And I thought they got the story and the performance , the story was good , the movie was good . The problem with this movie was the script . It was poorly written . And it was poorly acted . I got bored with this one in the 3rd . 1/3 . I was hoping this would be a better movie . I wanted to like it . I wanted to watch more of the characters . I just couldn't . And it is the same thing for me in watching this .|0
"In yet another case of misleading marketing , this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called `` Women in the Movies.'' It features two women who have not even played any roles in films in decades! In fact, the two stars who portray them are in their 70s. They have no real screen experience of any sort. In the opening credits, both of the stars are referred to as ""actors."" They both appear in only two scenes in the film. The film is titled ""Women Who Love to Shop."""|0
"The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the life long friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the Stooges multi decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays ""Curly"" Howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved Stooge."|1
"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this?"|1
"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.It had potential."|1
Being a wrestling fan , movies about wrestling generally suck ( Backyard Dogs , Bodyslam , Jesse Ventura story ) . It’s all the wrestling fans fault of course, and it’s just the way it is . So why did the WWE start up their own streaming video network ? It’s because Vince McMahon knew how to make it happen, and when you have money to do it , you don’t care what anyone says ! Vince was so confident he didn’t worry about it . He said to the WWE and everyone else .|0
Five Fingers is so bad , that I hardly know where to begin . So let me admit first , that I am not a fan of horror . I do not think that horror movies can ever be a good thing , and I certainly have not liked many films that have been horror movies . Horror is just one genre that I have avoided , because it has a bad reputation , and I don't really like horror movies anyway . Now I know that many horror fans enjoy horror movies , but for myself , I do not think that horror is one of the best films .|0
This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn't heard about before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It's a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years.|1
I 've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film . I 'm in total agreement with the consensus of opinion that it is an extremely well-made movie that deserves to be more widely appreciated. I 've been thinking for quite a while that this could be a sleeper hit for me, and boy am I glad I jumped at the chance . My wife and I sat and watched it again last night. We laughed our asses off and I 'm sure she would love to see it more as well. I have to say, I was surprised by how much I had to laugh.|0
I love Japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to Westerners. They might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others view things Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton!|1
It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of the old Vietnamese woman in the rice fields. In the book the woman says, 'I will never forget that day. You were so young. And I didn't even know you had a wife until she came and took me to meet your wife.' I was on the plane when I had to tell the captain that if we didn't land in South Vietnam, there would be an accident. And that's how I got on that plane too.|0
"A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" of the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent."|1
"Like the above poster, I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha... This movie is everything the above poster said and worse... Poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...There was very little here that was even worth watching... How this movie even got released is beyond me. Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.The movie I bought was labeled ""Piranha"" and not ""Piranha, Piranha!"" which is what it actually is... This is the only way they sold this movie at all.Peace Out."|1
"I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work.I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that ""Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah."" Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""Oldboy""?"|1
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart.|1
From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again . This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of why. This is an important movie to watch, because it is about a Dutchman who wants to get out of his country. He wants to be someone who is different in his mind , because he sees something different in this world. The film was released on March 7th, 2002. And the plot is really hard to put down . This movie is a masterpiece in the sense that you don't feel as if you are in a nightmare.|0
I viewed my videotape last night , for the first time in at least ten years . I found the first few minutes of the movie very boring . After the first few scenes , my interest was rekindled . I found that the film was very well done , but the movie was really dull . It has a good plot and the acting was superb . It had a good ending , I liked it , I gave it a 9.0/10 , but that does not do it justice . The movie has a good story and it is a very good drama .|0
Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, 'The Golden Lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later, far superior work.|1
Just what is the point of this film ? It starts off as one film , then changes track , and ends up being something that should not be seen. This is not cinema, it is propaganda , and if you want to get away from propaganda , go and see another film , you will find it is more entertaining to watch. You will find that this film has no story. It has no characters , no drama, nothing that you can identify with. All you can do is look at the actors , and listen to the dialogue , and watch the music.|0
You can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. We've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead.|1
I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye-rolling lines , it would be more entertaining to watch if they were delivered in a slightly different way, with the characters speaking like real people , but still making us laugh at their idiocy. It's not so much a remake or sequel as a reboot. It takes place one year after Aliens and takes place the same time as Aliens. The characters are largely the same however, and the story follows a similar outline.|0
"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle ""adventure"". Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco!"|1
This is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.Later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head.|1
'The Mill on the Floss ' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans , who wrote under the pen name A.E.H. Roberts, which she published in the U.K. in 1885. It was published in the USA, in 1891, under her name and was later reissued as a collection of short story collections under the same title. The book was the author's first novel. She was inspired to write the novel while staying at a convent school, where she taught English as a second language. Evans' novel was written at the beginning of her career as a writer, during the Victorian period in England.|0
"An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the film she ""throws back"" the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur! The high-toned English set she moves in is such a clichéd bunch of harummpf-ers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! ""My violeen! How weel I ever play eet again!"" ""Patreecia, my meelk is cold!"" It's campy beyond belief."|1
Yumiko ( Wakana Sakai ) , the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman , inherits control of her father's business and a huge fortune after his death. As she prepares to move to Tokyo with her husband and two young children, she is befriended by the eccentric, but extremely wealthy, Mr. Kurata, and begins to date him. When he suddenly disappears after a night of passionate sexual activity, Yumiko begins to fall in love with her mother's friend who has just moved into the home and who happens to be a lesbian.|0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema . Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, director Paul Thomas Anderson tells an engaging tale of a young man struggling to overcome his demons and find meaning in a brutal life. Heading into the final scenes of the movie, he finds himself in a place he never wanted to return to again. But with his past still haunting his present, the journey ahead will be difficult. The opening shot of the movie opens with an old black and white film on the wall of the old prison that is used in the movie.|0
"I honestly do n't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review , as a result of the fact that most of what I write about, in my review, is very subjective. However, I feel this article is relevant to many of the people that frequent this site. The first thing that comes to my mind is this: ""If they can make money out of it, then its okay."" This is my own personal bias and is not necessarily the only way to experience it."|0
I 'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie ! It seems that most of you liked the movie , as I did ! We have much fun here too , and we like to read your comments ! Please be sure to come back here again and visit us often !!! We always like to hear from our users !!! Thank you so much for reading this ! We appreciate all your support ! We will see you next time ! We will be having another movie in August , so please come and see it !!|0
This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc.|1
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work.|1
I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition . It was billed as the world's first full-frontal porno movie . it was pretty darn good and i would say it's the closest thing i've seen to real porno ever. I was surprised to see that even though it's not technically porn that it's still got all the hallmarks of it. This movie has one big problem with it, which is it's very low budget. It's all very amateurish and amateurish acting, and that makes it all the better for it.|0
Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid . Now think what would happen if you got to relive a memory from that time period. For me this might be seeing myself in my high school prom dress. I never would have dreamed I would be able to relive this experience . I thought it would be like going back and seeing my own past. I would have a great time reliving the memory but it would be boring . The problem with this memory is there are a few things that make this time a little weird .|0
I hate to admit it , but they were right to sack Schrader . The opportunity is here to build a team that not only plays good defence , but is defensively sound in the first place and that is something the Caps have been failing to do for decades . I would also have loved to see him get another season with the team or a trade , as he seems to have his head on straight and he is still a decent enough player . The problem is that the team has not been competitive this year .|0
I think Trash really sucks. I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I haven't seen that kind of c**p at the cinema since Female Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; it really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But actually I am glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion on it. One should see this film, even though it stinks.|1
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the Old West. Except it's not the real Old West, of course. It's some sort of Future West, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them.So, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies.|1
"The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only ""star power"" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. Someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin."|1
Not having any idea what this film was about , but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in the movie, i thought i would try my hand at interpreting the plot. I’m not sure that I’m any good at it, but here’s what I think the plot was about. The story takes place in the late 60’s, I think in New York, and is about a gay man who works at a bar. He meets a guy and they go out a couple of times until one time, they decide to go to his room.|0
"As an ancient movie fan , I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most influential horror films in history . I was curious to learn more. In the early 70's, I was fortunate to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, with a group of friends called the ""Lets Play the Odds"" group , as they called themselves. I had the pleasure of working in their theater. We were the only theatre in town , so no one knew what was going on in the world outside our theater."|0
"This movie was pathetically awful . The sound was terrible , the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating . There were few redeeming features . If this movie is on TV it would be a waste of time . There are not many bad movies that come from Hollywood so I was disappointed . There are worse movies . This was a bad attempt by Hollywood . I give it 2 stars . It's hard to be upset by this. I can understand that it's an attempt to cash in on the popularity of ""Star Wars"" and ""Ender's Game""."|0
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. I actually ran across this movie by accident. I was taping another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates...who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values (religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family.|1
`` Tragic Hero '' is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films , focusing on its lead character as an innocent child who becomes a ruthless gangster with no regard for anyone but himself. While the story could be described as well made and well acted, it can't really be classified as a great crime film. The film is pretty generic, and does not really bring out the best in the viewer. Plot: In this action-packed movie, an average teenager becomes a ruthless drug lord in the heart of a drug-filled city, with no respect for life.|0
I thought this series was going to be another fun , action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. Then the writing took a turn and became rather bland and unfiltered, with one-note characters and plot twists thrown in for the heck of it. I mean, the first two were actually good, but then the 3rd was a complete turn off. I was not a fan of the series when it started. Now, I think it's because I am tired and have just gotten to the point where I am done.|0
Genius or utter madness ? That depends on your interpretation of this film . I responded to it on the 3rd time watching this film . I did like it . There is some humour and there are some scary moments too . The acting was not very good . The first two films were good and it was only the third film that it started getting to me . This film is based on a short story by the Japanese author Haruo Shirane, who wrote the first of a long series of sci-fi books. He wrote a short story based on the events of WWII.|0
Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother.|1
This film has made e mad . I believe the original of this film , 'The Mask ' , was made back in the '70's in France. This 'Mask' is very cool and I can not find a way to describe how this film is. I would just suggest you check out this film to see what I am describing. I will be buying this when it comes out to my country . I was given a copy as a gift by a friend for my birthday and I just can not wait until I will be able to see the film in this country .|0
Dark and bleak sets , thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife ( or razor ) a perfect balance of light and darkness that will send shivers down your spine and make you want to run away. I was sitting in the front row of one of the many shows that we put together around the US. It was the second time we'd played to sold out crowds and the energy and excitement was contagious. I can't explain exactly why but the energy seemed to increase every time we played the same location.|0
This was a great film in every sense of the word . It tackles the subject of tribadism in a very interesting manner. It has no pretension and goes straight for it. If you want to know why the movie got an A , then here you go. The film deals with the issue in an unbiased manner. It doesn’t hesitate to point out the glaring flaws in India’s democracy. And if the film isn’t enough, then let it be known that the movie has no agenda. It simply tells the story.|0
Well , at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive . It appears to me that all of their movies (the ones we’ve already watched and those yet to hit theaters) are going to involve someone being stalked , stalked by something unseen in the shadows , or both , while the main character goes about her business trying to avoid these threats . It’s been a good year for scary movies . We’ve been treated to such diverse fare as The Sixth Sense , Don’t Go In There , and The Silence of the Lambs .|0
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic.|1
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series . I did not enjoy the first one but I loved this one. The first movie was about an apocalypse coming and how God, the devil or aliens could stop it. This one was about God giving the church a message to deliver to the world. This movie was a good reminder that there is good, evil and a whole mess of things in the world. This is a good film that should have been in the top 5 of this year.|0
Ocean 's twelve is probably better than Ocean 's eleven . I know most people would disagree , But I think it is a lot more likely that there is life on the moon than not , as we have discovered life on Mars . I don't think you have the logic for your claims. To be fair , you didn't ask me to come up with logic , you made statements that I can't disagree with. If life existed on the moon , there would surely be traces of life , even on our planet we have evidence of life on Venus .|0
... not to waste your time watching this vanity project . I 've had my comment deleted twice now , by two different people , and the third time the only person who actually replied to my comment is none other than this guy , who clearly is just a troll. Also , I think it's a great idea , it's an amazing idea , and it's a wonderful way to bring attention to something that nobody is talking about here . The only problem is that every time I read his comment, he makes a point I just don't like and I feel he's talking down to me.|0
If you want to truly experience the magic ( ? ) of Don Dohler , then check out `` Alien Hominids.`` An amazing film about a tribe of people who are able to communicate with each other and communicate with extraterrestrial beings. What I liked most about this film was the cinematography, acting and editing. This film was directed by Don Dohler. It was filmed in 1974. The film has a total running time of 76 minutes. It also has a soundtrack and music. The film was made on a very small budget and it looks amazing. Some of the scenes are amazing.|0
I'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse.|1
"Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It sure was no ""Later Day Saints."" The movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. But the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.Even though ""Kiss"" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for TV movie. Every scene is lighted like a department store."|1
A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours . The entire movie could have been made in less than one hour, and it would have still been one hour long . It was so badly acted, the only good part was the last 20 minutes . There is no way in the world you could spend two hours watching a movie, especially not one that's supposed to be a movie. I guess I'm just a guy who doesn't like over the top acting when I can get something good for free.|0
Normally I am a typical `` creepy-crawly-hatin ' '' girl , but after watching this film ( on YouTube of all places) , my opinion is that it was a classic . this is not to say it is bad , just that it is well done and has a nice blend of genres . the script has a very realistic look to it ( the characters are very real ) but is also a comedy of errors , and i must admit , it is very entertaining at times . and as a comedy , it is really fun .|0
"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an ""intelligent person"" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported ""genius"".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them."|1
Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes.|1
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. It wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. Case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call.|1
I 'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to life on film. For a studio to bring it to life as a musical, you'd think they'd have a lot more faith in it and more confidence that people would buy it in a theatre than they had in it when it was on film. And in some ways I don't have much confidence in this one myself, despite the fact that I think this could be a very successful film.|0
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines, and impeccable writing... but that's exactly what I got.Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the show's center and soon-to-be-president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious sorority on campus), isn't exactly supportive of his plans.|1
when this show first came to Disney, i love it started watching all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.I do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. I hat that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I mostly don't like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses the crap outta me.|1
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City , contrarian director Michael A. Arndt shot this short film on an iPhone 3GS , which was his way of making the film without using a crew and without the need for money to get it made. And it turns out that Arndt was able to get a lot of the film done in just a few hours using only a mobile phone. The film starts out in a very low-key way with Arndt walking into a drugstore and buying a pack of smokes.|0
"The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more ""user friendly"" for the big screen."|1
Firstly, I am a huge fan of crap films. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is just plain bad. I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning, it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot.|1
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly . It is no understatement to call it far worse than its predecessor. We were treated with some good performances, but what was missing in my mind was that there was a strong plot, an intriguing story line, a strong romance between two people who could have easily had a great love story . But it didn’t. It just seemed that way to me. If it was going to be a romantic film then I would expect at the very least a good love story. But it was not to be.|0
I heard legends about this `` film '' ( quotes used so as not to insult films ) for a long time. I had no idea how much I could do with them, until I read this book. It's the first book that has made me believe that what I see in movies are not just dreams. It was quite a change for me to believe that these things really could be true. The movie I saw in the park the first day I met him, I didn't have a clue where we were, or anything else. And now I know.|0
I am a Talent Manager. I have been for 15 years now. I have discovered some wonderful talent. They have been in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion Eddie Monroe was cast wonderful. I love seeing the ability of real people. Not just a name. The Actors in this movie were very natural and believable. I was very entertained by this film. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. I still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.|1
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be saying, you know what? I’ve got nothing more to say. This movie isn’t a failure because it doesn’t make any profound point. It’s a failure if you’re just looking for a simple point that will get people to laugh. It’s a failure because this movie never gets to say anything, so that means you’ve wasted half an hour watching it. This movie is never really funny.|0
"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"""|1
My favourite movie of all time . This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary on its 50th anniversary i am glad i got to see this before my time on the other side . I am still haunted by the ending and still have a lot of feelings for it . Its one of those films i would recommend to any cinephile . The acting and the cinematography alone would be enough for me to recommend this one to anyone . I am still trying to figure out how to get out from under the movie .|0
"Chris Morris ' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints , both from the audience and from his fellow cast members , about Morris' frequent use of excessive profanity . In his autobiography , "" The Man who would be King ,"" Morris claims he got into trouble with the police on three separate occasions while working in Australia . In this first installment in a new series of his autobiographical novel, "" Brass Eye , "" Morris claims he was threatened with a long prison sentence in Australia if he did not shut down the production company he was involved with in Australia , and return to England ."|0
I saw the movie on its North American premiere ( July 14 , 2004 ) at the Fantasia Festival . It was very interesting to compare the movie with the storyboard from the film. I was astonished by the quality of this film. I thought that the movie would be better than the original. But when I watched the movie I could not find any flaw of the film. I really like the performance of the actors. And I would like to know what was the reason for the film to be changed. Because I was very curious to know if there are any changes in the storyboard or not .|0
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill."|1
"This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is especially awful; it really appears that the editor (if there was one)literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. The opening has to be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know there are ""B"" films - but are there ""H"" films? If so, this one's an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan."|1
When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island , they soon find that their new home isn’t as idyllic as they’re prepared for. But as a group of misfits and misanthropes struggle to hold on to the small piece of land, they slowly come to realize that they are part of something much greater than they could have imagined: a hidden community, living in harmony with nature. The series, which was first aired in 2017, was followed by a spin-off film last year.|0
"No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being ""naughty"" exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath."|1
This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie.|1
This movie was really funny . The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy , should get ready to be disappointed . For example , this film is the story of a family of three , one father , mother and two son . The first son is always getting into trouble , his mom is always worried about what to do . He is never able to get a decent job and the one that is working for the most part is not really making any profit . So , his mother , father and brother make a decision , they are going to buy a business .|0
If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared , Death in Venice would have to be considered the first one. That is why it has to be a first movie that has to be destroyed and one that can be saved. And the one that can be saved would be one that has to be shot and edited. That means the movie has to be made out of scratch, it has to be shot by people who can not make a movie of this magnitude , and it also has to be edited by people who are not experienced in this kind of stuff.|0
There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part.|1
Hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius.|1
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar . Great for a night or a weekend night with friends. I like this show very much because its a funny show and has some nice and funny moments which gives a lot of satisfaction to me and my friends. I like this show to watch it while having a meal with friends, I feel like this is the best program for a night time when you have a lot of time to relax and have fun with the friends or with your family.|0
Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot.|1
This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(John Candy)to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then I honestly don't like him at anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed.|1
Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie It's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful.|1
After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). Porn-movie level acting. Cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.Costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any minute.Nothing to really recommend in this film.|1
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Its been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way! !|1
Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.|1
River's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one. Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.|1
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only about 30 minutes into it but I was so fascinated with the subject matter that I could not help myself from sitting there the whole time with a grin on my face. It is a must see film and in fact I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding out the true facts behind the paranormal activity taking place in modern society. The story is told through a documentary style approach and is very well done I must admit.|0
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid.|1
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.On this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are.|1
The subject matter was good , direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major . The film was decent . The cast was superb . However the story was average . One can easily find films with a similar theme at reasonable price . The problem with this film is lack of screen time on Mohanlal as an action hero. This is not only his first film but this is his first film after a long gap of 16 years from his last acting venture . Hence it would be wise for the producers to get him some more roles to boost his career .|0
To put it simply , this was a pompous piece of canine poopie . Overly stagey and everyone being the butt of its joke , you have to marvel that it was even published . I mean , who writes with a straight face ? I’m guessing the author has no life . Anyway , it went on for pages of what could’ve been filler , I thought , as I was laughing so hard at myself and all the people who were laughing with me . It’s only after I finished that I realised this article was written by a dog .|0
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least . The basic plot is 3 old business associates who want to buy the property of an old and wealthy woman who has a large collection of rare paintings that she wants to donate to the public museum. The old lady who lives in the old house refuses to sell, claiming that her life was better before. After many days of arguing and a lot of heated debates between the three old men, she finally decides to sell to them for a huge amount of money. But there is a catch.|0
"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.I also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, ""that was perfect""."|1
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great . I rated it 8 out of 10 . The story is really good and I can't wait to read the next books in the series . I would give the book 5 1/2 thumbs up , just because it is such a good read and has a very good ending . This is one of my favourite books of all time because of the good writing . I would rate it higher , if I had read the first book a few years ago and would rate it a 7 or a 8 .|0
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls.|1
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window.|1
WOW!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be real stupid. No, this film is far more in common with The Thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) Lots of Carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood.|1
I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress.|1
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi,Don Cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.The movie opened in 2 U.S. theatres in late April 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007.We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off.This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill.|1
A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel).|1
The 1980 's 'My Dinner with Andre , ' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory , is essentially a dialog with his wife, but with a few additions from Wallace. The conversation between Wallace and Andre takes place at a restaurant in the early '90s, when Wallace, who had just started writing for a series of '80s sitcoms that would run for three seasons each , was trying to find his way as an actor , and when he was on the road with the NBC show , which was about a group of guys on a college campus , which was about to come to an end.|0
Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.|1
ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability.|1
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January (2005) I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so unlike her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.|1
A real let down , the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for a hard watch . I found the lack of a story line or characters a real let down and I found that the main character and her story lacked the emotional intensity of the previous novel . . . and the ending was so sad . I do like the ending but it doesn’t hold together and the reader is left wondering what has been going on since the ending of book one . It is very hard to read something that is so full of such intensity and emotion .|0
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I was not really expecting much as I had not actually read the book. Having read it once was enough to convince me of the beauty of the novel itself. It is very difficult to describe a book in such a way that people can understand what the author has done in writing. In the past few years, I had heard so much from so many people that had read the book that I had not understood what all they were talking about as I was reading the book.|0
Why are there no good reviews ? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War 2, the prison has been overrun and overrun. The prisoners are being held in the prison for two days, and are told that they can go out to play if they like, or they can wait until their turn to be shot. So they wait, they wait and wait, they wait until their turn. That’s the plot, I swear! And that’s where things get interesting. It is very hard to describe in words, so here’s an image.|0
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey ' . Endless nature footage of the creatures is always on the tip of everyone's minds, and while there's definitely something special about this episode, it did have its flaws. First and foremost, you're never really that sure what's going on with this episode compared to what's been said in the media. The way this story unfolds is so well written that you can almost predict what's going to transpire before it does. That being said, there are some scenes that were very interesting to watch.|0
"I love these awful 80 's summer camp movies . The best part about `` Party Camp '' is the campy music. Here are some favorite tunes:

`` I Want to Hold Your Hand'' by Sam Cooke. `` The Girl I Love`` by Dionne Warwick. `` I Want You (She's Killing Me)`` by James Carr. `` This Guy's in Love with You`` by The Spinners. `` Dancing In the Street`` by The Supremes. `` I Just Can't Wait Till Tomorrow`` by Sam and Dave. `` Just A Little Talk With You`` by Ray Charles."|0
Right up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Too bad too, because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot.|1
"Well I guess I know the answer to that question . For the MONEY ! We have been so bombarded with it over the past few years we don't give a sh1t. We have seen it, we've seen it again, it's like it's an epidemic out here, we can't shut our eyes to it, and then we get a call from a local business saying ""hey we're doing great things here in our community so why don't you do the same thing?"" It's like our whole community thinks we deserve it and we just take it as it comes."|0
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
Once again , Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load . It has humour ( `` You 're just going to end up in space? ' '' is a winner), romance ( `` I don't want to spoil anything. You'll have to watch the series to see. ' '' ) and, of course, action . There was also the opportunity for the Doctor to have a little fling in the middle of the story . He is in love with Clara Oswald and, despite having no idea about time or space , has a little fun with her in '' The Impossible Astronaut ''.|0
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. Have a look at the outfits. Everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! It's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows.|1
"""Eaten Alive"" goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" but it's also a far more sillier film. I mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. Tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov)."|1
Never, ever, have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. In some ways a little like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time.There are a heap of lead characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as persons show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter.The closest equivalent in a US movie, I can think of, which then is far weaker in every respect, is the Royal Tenenbaums.|1
"""Rififi"" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. Jules Dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the Hollywood glamour of ""Ocean's Eleven."" The robbers in ""Rififi"" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence."|1
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I did n't feel like watching tripe like that. I guess you can call it bad TV. We had a long talk with my dad about going back and living there, so we will know in a month or so if we should go back. My brother and his wife, who I haven't seen in seven years, also live there. It's an amazing place to live and it's a beautiful area. It's just hard to leave.|0
"Movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. Sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. A light hearted ""golden years"" romantic comedy, Out To Sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs to be given a break. This is just good, light hearted fun. It's not meant to be a deep movie."|1
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic . It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against evil, but I don't think that that was the case . Instead of trying to show a real life scenario of a kid who was bullied in class , they used a bunch of bullies from their school who are making fun of him . I believe that there is real life bullying out there, but I think this movie was showing that a kid is trying to deal with it in a way that no one else wants to .|0
"I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him I would have to take back my promise. We kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.This ""movie"" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100."|1
"Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career, spanning over 300 movies. While few (if any) would call him great, his films' obscure connections to underground culture (via reference, tribute, or influence) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films (""Piranha"", ""Humanoids from the Deep"", ""The Black Scorpion"", etc. ), without improving on them in the slightest."|1
"This is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Some kind of Wonderful"".Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.True, most of the acting sucks but ...I have been in love with Nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since."|1
"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin."|1
"To think this film was made the year I was born. To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of ""homeland security"". To think this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides."|1
This movie is not worth anything . I mean , if you want to watch this kind of stuff , go and rent . If you want something better, go and watch it . It's like watching a movie where a kid plays with a toy for a day or two , but it's so boring that the kid thinks it's fun . It's a shame , because it's really pretty . I don't know if I want to put this on DVD . I think I would be disappointed by this . It's like a video game .|0
"""Black Vengeance"" is an alternate title for ""Ying hung ho hon"" AKA ""Tragic Hero"" (1987). I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, ""Gong woo ching"" (""Rich and Famous""), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called ""The Black Six"")."|1
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film : I love Park Chan-Wook 's work. He made a lot of good, solid movies. Even if I don't think I've loved his last two as much as many people did, I will at least say I appreciate his past work more than most. His movies tend to be dark and intense with very few bright, sunny moments. That's not even the best part of his work, but I'll get to that in a moment. I think most people have an idea of how Park Chan-Wook sees the world in his films.|0
Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and god bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.Exploitation films should be judged on story, sex, and gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place.|1
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life.|1
I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher films on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films.To be fair, it started off OK, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods.|1
this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far. i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes....'9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated.|1
I found West Point to be an agreeable film , although I doubt that I would watch it again . It's a lot of fun, but the film is long (over two hours) and it tries to be too many things. In the end the plot is not the most interesting part of the film. The action is the only interesting part. There are some good actors , and they deserve a better role in movies. And, for the sake of all those people who love to hate the army , it is a bit hard to hate the army , as it is not that bad .|0
Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping. Were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy. Most of the cast are content to simply phone it in, and don't really seem to care about the film in the least. The writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the name of the actors that respectively play them. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old REALLY quick. Even the late great character actor, Brion James can't save this stinker.|1
Some sort of accolades must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline'. It's actually out Full-Mooned Full Moon. It bears all the marks of, say, your `Demonic Toys' or `Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish.|1
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people.|1
Yet again , director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick . This time, however, it's a more personal, psychological thriller with an underlying theme of guilt. In this case, guilt over an affair with a younger woman. The opening scene in which Bronson takes the blame for an unsolved double murder sets up the film to build to the climatic confrontation at the end of the film that leaves the audience guessing who is responsible for both murders (or is it one or the other?).|0
The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing.|1
1) Bad acting.2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.3) Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows up so early. The escape ship also got sunk too fast.|1
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode.|1
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film , it is not until the third act that the film finally gets going in terms of the action. The third act may be the most boring of the film , it is however the most enjoyable. The plot of the third act is a bit of a puzzle , it doesn’t quite have a linear narrative but is rather a string of events and events and events that lead up to a very simple conclusion at the end .|0
"""Strangers on a Train"" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's ""Speed."""|1
"""Witchery"" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.The gore in ""Witchery"" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets ""sucked"" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast!"|1
I walked into Blockbuster , itchin ' to watch some good old fashion action movies . So i browsed around for a while and when i came across this one movie i decided to give it a try . And boy am i glad i did , Blockbuster has brought the best movies back to life . Blockbuster brings you all the classics that you may have completely forgotten . The movie is called Blockbuster . The movie starts with a young man who has the ability to make things move on his own . The young man lives with his mother and younger brother .|0
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!!|1
"This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. I've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. This isn't it. The ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.Here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.1) A posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname ""the brick"". 3) A couple that shag too loudly."|1
Dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrongfully arrest an innocent man, it was originally released by Marvel Comics in 1974. Dolemite is the best selling black comic book character ever. The character was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the 1970s. Dolemite was one of many black characters created by Jack Kirby in the early 1980s; like many of the black characters in Marvel Comics, he was a character who did not become popular until later in the 1980s. In this article I will discuss the origins of this character and his development in comics.|0
Oh dear ! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one, so perhaps they're right and this one won't last for long. You see, this is what happens when you try to compete with the big boys of British television, the BBC. After all, this isn't television, it's a soap opera. (Which, as far as I know, is something you're not legally allowed to do). I'm sure they'll be back with a new soap this summer, and it will be a very good soap opera.|0
This is just one of those films which can not justify much of anything that happens . These people are a lot of people in the film . They make the story interesting but the plot and the acting is not very interesting . I am still not clear as to why this is made . The story in a way is interesting , but the people are so selfish and stupid . They do not really want to see what is happening in the film . It was a good effort at first . Now the film is a disappointment . It is not even worth watching .|0
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle.|1
"Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to horn in on Chaplin's action after the studio head hollers, ""Next!"" Chaplin manages to walk in over Turpin, however. Charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a big break, but will a star be born? There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving slapstick from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight."|1
This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock.|1
Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun.The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls.|1
"Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense . Unfortunately very little of it does, which is a pity because if you did, you’d have a much better time and a lot more money. ~Candyfloss (attributed)

I want to be an entrepreneur. I’ve read, and reread, countless books on the subject, all with varying degrees of success, and yet I have not been able to do it, which is why I’m asking: Why don’t I just go ahead and take the risk and start my own thing?"|0
We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is.|1
This is one awful movie ! ! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I didn't give that movie any chance to get better than that. It doesn't matter how bad a movie gets, people are always going to come up with excuses to say that this is the worst movie. The worst movie I saw this year was The Last Stand and while that was not even as bad as this movie, the movie made me feel so sad about what the war was doing to people. This movie is so bad and yet so popular !|0
I've seen all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.|1
"A fairly interesting look at some characters from India 's burgeoning middle class . Although India is rapidly modernizing , India is still a society that has many of the elements of "" the dark ages "". And one of the main problems with this, is the lack of a sense of class consciousness on the part of some members of India 's middle class. To be clear , the middle class, in India has nothing to do with being poor , or with being a poor middle class. To the contrary, India has become extremely wealthy and middle class over the past 40 years."|0
I found the Movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the film the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful He was real at his character. The ending took a wonderful twist. I would recommend you seeing it. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol.|1
In the European TV industry , movies like this one are called `` stickers '' . TV stations buy them from the studios, the studios buy them from the distributors , and the distributors sell them to their subscribers. This is a good analogy. When the studios want to buy TV spots, they don't go directly to a TV station; instead they buy the packages of spots that are sent to them by their advertising agencies, which usually consist of six, eight, and sometimes twelve different TV stations. In the U.S.A. , a similar phenomenon exists.|0
A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help . To young to be on his own the cat needs to start working for him. The first step is to teach him to hunt, a cat must learn to hunt from the prey he's chasing. The cougar is taught to hunt but he has a different idea of what a hunting experience should be. A cougar has to find an animal that will give him something to eat, after all a cougar is a wild animal. The cougar is not only a naturalist, he can make tools out of wood and hunt with a bow.|0
This movie is a mystery . It 's not scary , it 's spooky . You 'll probably jump at the ending , which is that the guy in the black cloak is going to take over the world . you may find it a little scary or a little boring . you may not like the ending or the way it was shot . but you should see it . you should definitely see it . this is the greatest film i 've seen in years . it has been nominated for an oscar , and has won a bunch , and won 't win a damn thing .|0
"if u haven't seen Vijay in ""Ghillli"", ""Gilly"" or ""Ghillie"". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls Velu ""Maacha"". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are brilliant as well. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it."|1
This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts . Donald J. Trump. But he is not who we thought, is not who we hoped, and is not who we voted for. But he did what he said and he did what the people told him he was supposed to do and he is here to stay. This is a story about how one man can have a dream and a vision, can have courage and will power to overcome many problems and many obstacles, and he does overcome all obstacles, and then he does achieve the dreams he had.|0
This is primarily about love in WWII , yet we must remember that it 's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas , and is also the true story of one of the most amazing women in my life , who has a lot to do with so many other women who helped me get to where I am in life. On a trip to Japan for a couple of weeks , one night a few of us had the idea to go out in a small bar on the way home from dinner to order some drinks. The waitress was cute , and we were all in a nice mood.|0
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men , which he perfected in his first series appearance in 2002. His role on the show is now the butt of a lot of jokes, and he doesn’t always enjoy the attention or the adulation. Here’s how he reacts to being called the “best actor on The Big Bang Theory.” (Or how he reacts when he sees his name in lights at the Golden Globes or on the front page of Variety.) What are your career highlights?|0
"I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre.It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful.The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims ""Bunnyfluff!"" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!"|1
"I loved the first movie , the second one was okay , disappointed John Cleese was n't jean bob anymore in the 3rd one which was ok . And I thought it was too slow at first , but it picked up later

Yes, its slow. The only thing that is slow in the movie is the first 15 minutes. Other than that its a very fast movie. Click to expand...

That was an exception, I've been noticing that it's actually getting faster in some of the parts that were slow in the earlier movies."|0
Have seen this movie today . Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist . The story and performances of the cast do not stand out as Oscar material. There is something lacking here and the film does not seem to fit in to any of the major genres and categories . But it is a fun film . It is not a bad film , but not Oscar material at all . I was looking forward for the Oscar . It is a film , which is not Oscar material . I really did not like the film , though .|0
Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the first to be widely recognized by the white world. By the time of the release of Dolemite, it was already the standard-bearer for what was to become known as the third phase of the black exploitation film. A genre that had begun to emerge as black artists were given more freedom to play and express themselves, even as their white audiences remained largely silent and uninvolved in the process. Black cinema in the wake of Dolemite could no longer be confined to the ghetto.|0
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth.From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle, which makes for superior suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety!|1
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness, ""Half Empty"" is a must-see. This original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make ""The Producers"" seem boringly staid. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. When his book on happiness, ""North Star"" finds zero success in the States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour."|1
I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. Of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr. Frankenstein's did. There is always something they didn't anticipate. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here.|1
This movie really is that bad , and I 'm normally a sucker for bad movies , but this was just awful . you know that I was really rooting for this to be true , but as it was , this was one of those movies that will have a few people that have no idea what happened , but those are few and far between . the film is based on a story by a very well known author of vampire novels and has some interesting twists and turns , which is really what made this film so interesting .|0
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. As previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. I felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones.|1
i was one `` chosen '' to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film was released as a single film, meaning that you get a cut of any money that the movie grosses and the distributor splits with you, so that you only have the movie for a month. the good thing about this film is that it is extremely short, because the studio is afraid that people will rush to the theater and it will be a big bomb, so that they can try and recoup some of the lost money.|0
Movies are n't always suppose to be about deep , provolking thoughts . Sometimes they 're simply meant to be a form of catharsis. Movies are often about the escapades of two people in their late teens. Often their lives are not stable , meaning that they have very little in common . They have one thing in common: their teenage years are a time when they try to find themselves. Most often they fail, because they don't know who they are. But even when they do, there is always hope because they have each other.|0
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the actors.i care because it’s gore.i know who i want to see get their head chopped off in this movie.and that is why i want a 10!i’m sorry i want gore but not that much.sorry to break this news but i don’t care.and you can go and find out more on gore.i’m sure you will be happy with it. The movie starts out pretty slow, and is actually quite boring.|0
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. He also thinks he's a chicken.Sounds bizarre right? Well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on.The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck.|1
"Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and "" Big "" John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film."|1
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself. The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart.' The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from. Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie. I expected a sort of crappy, direct-to-video version of `Heathers' targeted at the teenagers of today.Let me tell you what `Tart' was really about.|1
I was rather disappointed . The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins to the last 5 minutes , I love this movie. It is just a wonderful movie , a beautiful story which I would like to see . And I was surprised to see how much this film had to say . The ending , was just so good . And I also loved the sound . I think that is what made the film so great to watch . And all the actors . They all gave very good performances , especially Yuko. She was amazing .|0
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Steve Carrell as a young man who has had his life completely turned upside down by a very powerful woman and she is not letting it go until he does everything she wants to see in the next few years. He goes to college in the fall and falls in love with the professor’s beautiful teenage daughter. I saw this film in the cinema when it came out. I remember not being too impressed by the story itself.|0
John Knowles modern masterpiece , A Separate Peace , are one of many subtle , and subtly is the watchwords in the film. It is no wonder why they made such a long film . They have done a great job with their story telling , and have given a depth to the characters. The film is set in the late 1920s , and has a strong moral message about how power corrupts and destroys. It contains a lot of drama and suspense , but I did not feel it was intense enough. The ending was not that bad , and it does not seem as if they rushed the story to an end .|0
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.But Rita drives this whole movie.|1
Lame . Lame . Lame . Ultralame . Shall I go on ? There is one , I repeat *one* person who could do anything with a little time on their hands, and that person is Mika . It's so easy for her to be involved in a drama like this, so easy that sometimes I wonder if she's aware of the fact that this is really happening to her. She seems to be unaware of any of it, and even though she knows that she is being used to play the game with her friends, she doesn't seem to want to play any games at all.|0
"You know sometimes you just gotta have it? That's how this movie is with me. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but I find myself reaching for it when I'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, I am just not a ""goofy movie"" kinda guy.You can read the synopsis so I don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like Kelsey Grammer you will probably like this movie.One more thing, be SURE to watch the end credits."|1
"To keep it as simple as possible . This is a very good show . That is well written , and the actors are awesome . This show does not try to make a ""deep"" issue with its subject matter . The story is told from the characters' point of view . It's about a group of people . They are very different in all aspects . This allows the storyline to flow through the characters . Every single character has a different side to them . There are characters who do the right thing . Some are good , others are evil ."|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
It's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a TV show.DORIS DAY decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why.|1
Finally ! Other people who have actually seen this show ! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen ! I have seen it over a 100 times and still get goosebumps ! I think it is the funniest thing that has ever been done ! And it is very very good ! I love the music and everything ! The show is so good ! I love the songs ! There is a whole lot of funny stuff ! I think it is great that it is still running so long after it was first aired ! It makes it even more special ! And the characters are all great !|0
I 'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie . Even my 4 and 6 year old boys love the movie . The movie starts with a lot of heart and romance . I just can't find a negative side . I was a bit worried about it but after seeing it I'm happy I saw it. I loved the music . It was good . It's a great movie for both kids and adults. This was a great movie from start to finish!! I've had it on VHS since the 80s and was so excited to see it in theaters again.|0
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it and I've always had a soft spot for her.Basically, the owner of a book store, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it.|1
"This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of ""we're just a bunch of wacky guys"" in the midst of the ""my goodness this can be really dangerous"" parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn't bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.Thing is I'm a John Travolta fan."|1
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie has no real plot. I watched it on a Friday night. There was nothing else to do so I went out and had a good time with my mates. A couple of hours later and I had half an hour of sleep at home. I watched the DVD on Saturday morning and found the plot, characters and acting superb. This was a movie I didn’t expect to enjoy too much, although it was very entertaining.|0
well , what can i say . WHAT THE F * * K ? There really is n't much to say . This review has been very hard to write . I mean it , there is nothing to say about the film that i haven't already written about in detail in other places . This is a very well made and well made to watch film and it is also a well made movie . As you can imagine , there are some people out there who say the film should have been cut by half . I do not see this at all .|0
My grandad gave me this DVD . With friends like these . The front cover looked quite scary thought i had no idea how good they actually were! I got in my room and watched it . The first one I watched got me interested in watching this one too . They were both amazing . The movie wasn't bad either . There are not many horror movies out there that are like the one I have read about, or even seen in a theater . There is something that is just so special about it, but I will start off with what my mom always says .|0
This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist.|1
Very odd , this seems like a very average movie to me , if not slightly less . It is still not bad , but it is not really that good . It seems to come and go , it does not hold up in many parts , but is still a very good film . It is not a complete mess , there is no way it should have been this bad . I don’t want to give it too much more praise , but this is still one of my favorite horror films of all time .|0
"This movie has some good performances , as others have pointed out , but suffers ( as others have pointed out ) because of one thing:

The plot is too simple. The movie should be set in the early 60s and center on a group of men and women who are all in their late teens, early teens, early 20’s or early 30’s. But this movie is set just in time for them to be teenagers, and we get to hear about it, but we are only allowed to see and hear about a few things about their lives."|0
A rather mild horror movie ; if not for a couple of sex scenes , it could easily have been made for family viewing ; there's a very good plot , too, and a lot of sex ; it could have been written for the stage . and it would have been a winner if it had been . . . or not . . . the horror of the movie is all the more frightening because of the quality of the sex . when the sex scenes were shot , director john leonhardt and his camera man , steve jonas , decided to get the real thing .|0
Ten years before `` The Matrix '' and hot on the heals of `` They Live '' came this brilliant sci fi novel that was so well ahead of its time and has spawned a movie adaptation that's currently playing in cinemas in the United States and elsewhere. The Matrix, or The Matrix Reloaded as it's more commonly known, was published in 1993 and is the first book in James Sallis' Matrix trilogy. The book was written after Sallis had completed the screenplay for The Matrix, which was based on the original script by William Gibson and Larry Frain and starred Laurence Fishburne.|0
"This movie is on cable sporadically, and I never really watched it, thinking it would be similar to the Bruce Willis film ""Ïn America"", with the usual trite story about American freedom, etc. But it was not; it was so much more!.Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I have never seen him in a movie I haven't loved, even if the script is bad, because he is so talented). Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job."|1
Dear reader , Watch out ! This movie is not really a movie , though its creators have the impertinence to try to make it look like a good movie. The movie will only entertain you to a certain degree , so you should watch it with a sense of humour, and remember it is a drama, not a film ! There are only two people who know the truth. One who knows the truth has already lost her life, and the other does not know what she is doing, she has no idea about life as we know it.|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies . The more bizarre and imaginative the film , the more fun I have in watching it. However, I would not want to watch a horror movie that I know will be too bizarre for my family to enjoy as well . So in an effort to keep my horror movie recommendations a bit more normal and entertaining , I will bring you a collection of horror movie suggestions that fit within the general horror movie category. If you like these horror movie suggestions , I would like to hear from you !|0
cool flick . enjoyable to watch . hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon . i really like the music and the acting . a good story line with a good villain and a fun plot overall . i recommend it ! The story was fun to follow, I liked it and was waiting for the next one to be released. The ending was great! It was a great way to finish out the series. If you are a fan of horror and gore films, this is a great series. The ending was amazing and I couldnt stop laughing. This is a must have!|0
"in his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by Columbia pictures.It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.This monologue is not just about ""The Killing Fields"", or ""Swimming to Cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them."|1
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film! 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind.|1
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie.|1
I do n't care what anyone else says , this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film by any filmmaker in the last ten years. it is awful . i have no doubt this was the last film to ever make it to the screen before the digital revolution took it away. it is a movie so horrible in every aspect , i don't know if there has ever been a movie made with so much contempt for the audience and how people will react to it , you could tell it was the final nail in the coffin.|0
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie , but a solid flick in all respects . Everything from acting to cinematography is of an extremely high caliber . The actors are great to watch , they have chemistry , and most of all , the acting is not over done . The movie has many of the usual ingredients such as humor, action and romance but it also has a lot of heart. The movie focuses mainly on the relationship between two teenage lovers who have had a falling out. It also focuses a fair bit of the drama which is brought forth between them by their mother.|0
It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies ! And there are a lot to choose from ! Let’s take a trip back to the 1980s, which were a very different time for sports movies in general and for the hockey genre in particular. We’d all heard about the “80s”, and we all knew that they had been quite a few great films in that decade: The Breakfast Club, The Natural, Star Wars, Rocky, and so on… And then there were some less-known gems too.|0
What a dreadful movie. The effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. The acting was awful and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and run for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make Ms Green look to unfit).|1
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie , you can never be sure if it will be the movie he’s in. He is so versatile in that way – he’s in so many films and he seems to have a lot of work to do. And yet, when he does get the chance to be in a film , he makes it a joy to watch. He plays so many different characters and there is always a story behind the character, and you get the feeling that he wants you to see him in whatever he is playing.|0
Man, what an awful film. As with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. Come on!|1
I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don't know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't.|1
8/2008 . When I originally wrote my comments , shortly after first seeing this film , I took a critical approach. In the end, I feel that even though the movie is too long, I will still rate the movie a 7.5/10, simply because it was a very entertaining and entertaining film . The action sequences were awesome , the cast was outstanding , and the overall film was well worth watching . If you are in the mood for a mindless fun film , give this one a watch , and maybe even a few drinks along the way . Thanks for reading my review .|0
"Although this has to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode is n't badly written or acted

We've all been there. This isn't an episode in the usual sense of ""the worst episode ever,"" because this was not a bad episode for its own sake. It's just that, as much as it tries, it fails to provide anything particularly interesting or surprising. This was a good episode of a good show, one that's worth watching when it's on, and one worth watching in spite of its shortcomings."|0
Citizen Kane....The Godfather Part II....D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars as Dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. He clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (I myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive.|1
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist.Some one at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.A few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks so much, Sci-Fi!|1
I cant go for long describing this tittle , simply because I do not feel strong about it . I am a very emotional person and I dont like to draw things and write about the things that are not in my head . Its like my head is full with what i am thinking and feeling about a thing . I dont know why , I just feel like its better this way . I dont know if this was true or not . I also have some bad memories . So i think the thing I am describing is just a thing I saw .|0
Having endured this film last night , I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal. Not only did the film have a very strong sense of atmosphere, it had an almost documentary style to it. You don’t think about a film like this because you don’t think of it. In a sense it’s like watching something on television. That is to say that I’m glad that I watched it because of how much I thought about the characters. But more importantly, how I thought about the film as a whole .|0
"In ""Red Letters"", Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with ""Red Letters""...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time."|1
"If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the ""bad grrl"" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved."|1
Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed.The plot centres around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. In order to do so, he teams up with a clan of Ninjas, led by three masters  gold lamé ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants.|1
Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie . This movie gives out horrible messages to women about what they should and shouldn't do on social media. Not to mention, it was just plain weird and creepy. I'm sorry but I can't even explain why this movie was so wrong. I will just say that it doesn't even make sense. I thought it was great the first time I saw it. The thing about the movie is that the actors have gotten to this point in their lives.|0
Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore 's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as good as it gets. I'm surprised they had the courage to put a movie in the theater with a guy who has less than 1/2 the intelligence and talent of an 8th grader! It's really a shame you don't have a lot of free time to watch it . . . because it is an awesome movie! The only thing I would like to see is a scene or two with Dolemite in the background singing . . . something . . . .|0
"I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish ""Origin of Species"". Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life."|1
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist on the public this movie. They all think it is ok and acceptable that they can use the people’s image, and money, for their selfish and greedy purposes. The people who run Hollywood and big media, have the power, money and control to do anything they want to these poor people. They should get off of their butts and wake up, before they do irreparable harm to themselves, the world and the people with whom they share their wealth.|0
`` The Apartment Complex '' is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story. In short, a family of four, consisting of father and daughter (a lesbian couple), and the son (an openly gay woman), lives at The Apartment Complex, a campy vacation home owned by a self-help guru. In order to save money to afford the trip of a lifetime, all members of the family work at the resort, including the daughter's boss. The Apartment Complex was originally released in 1995. It was distributed on VHS and DVD.|0
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ! 'Rock Star ' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen . The movie was created in the UK and was shot in the US . It was directed by Peter Weir and stars Richard Dreyfuss . The movie was released on December 11 , 2008 . Here is the synopsis . After an incident on a mountain road, Rock Star's driver is paralyzed from the waist down. When the doctors discover that he has a rare form of muscular dystrophy, he escapes the hospital, but soon finds that he has become a criminal in a town run by thugs.|0
"I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another ""Biblical"" film again, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. Hello? EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to scripture."|1
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash. The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly.Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it. First off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot. It cranks everything up and just goes. Next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat.|1
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches , each one of them focussing on a female personal device that has no other purpose than the creation of art. There are three main female characters. The first and the only female character of the first episode was a fashion model who uses various art materials to decorate herself. She uses a variety of materials to make her own clothes and accessories and decorates herself with various arts. The second character is a high school girl. She is always on the lookout for the latest fashion.|0
If you can stomach the campiness , this movie should make you laugh out loud several times . It did , and you should check out its IMDB listing for details on how it got into this position. What’s it about? It’s an adaptation of a short story by Arthur C. Clarke, in which the main character is the last human on Earth, and he is fighting a battle to prevent an alien invasion of our planet. In other words , the movie is basically an homage to the Star Trek series , except that it takes place many years after the events in the original television series.|0
This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else.|1
"i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the ""realism"" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the ""little"" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it."|1
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi,based of his biography `Wired' , wrote by Bob Woodward.All of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of John Belushi we see one angel accompany Belushi during few points of his life.Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of Belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.The director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused.|1
As a fan of Henriksen ( I liked him in the `` Millennium '' series ) and of course Lorenzo Lamas , I would say that it`s an overrated piece of trash. It`s just not his stuff. It`s really not his thing. It`s his first work. It`s almost an experiment in his career. He should have left the project. He should have walked away. He should have given his rights back. I think that this was the wrong choice. But I guess that was his only choice.|0
Badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners.David is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an IQ below sea level.|1
"After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It wasn't ""heartwarming"" or ""clever""; it was merely an amalgam of every other ""mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other"" movie ever made.The characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse -- We have the Blacks, the Hispanics, The Jews, The Asians, and the Homosexuals -- and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do."|1
Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face.|1
This thing , directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien , is worst than all the turkeys that you may have ever eaten. It is not a turkey; it is not even a turkey of any kind. It may not even be a turkey. It is, in fact, nothing. It may not exist at all. It may not even have been there in the first place , or even ever. It may just be an impossible hallucination, a nightmare that we’ve been living and dreaming. This thing exists, and has existed since before our ancestors could remember.|0
Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost.|1
Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer , Allegra Geller ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ), who travels to Seattle to attend a convention called Game Developers Live, hoping to find a new job and possibly even get her old job back, but when the world she lives in crashes into the future, she finds that not everything is as she left it behind. She’ll learn that the people she thought were her friends turned out to be aliens and that even the ones who were supposed to be her enemies are looking out for her.|0
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up . And I enjoy Leslie Nielson 's comic skills. (She drew The Adventures of Wacky Races in a more sophisticated way). I like her work. I like Leslie 's sense of humor in her cartoons. She's got a good imagination, she can think outside the box and I enjoy her sense of humour. And I'm sure she loves to laugh. But what Leslie Nielson did that is beyond me, she made a cartoon about the life of a little kid.|0
The basic idea behind `` Dungeon of Harrow '' is n't all bad . The acting , however , is awful . The plot itself is so incredibly cliche it's hard to believe this movie actually came from the minds of actual writers . ``Harrow'' is a comedy-drama about a young man ( Ryan Gosling ) who finds his way out of his deadbeat family and into an adventure to find his father's buried treasure . As they travel across the wild and unpredictable American South , the treasure hunt becomes a search for the father who abandoned his family .|0
ExCUSE me , but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o ' poop . I had to make it up , because if I had done a piece like this , I might have to be put away in a straitjacket and fed to the sharks . You know who doesn't like poop ? People who take drugs and eat feces and/or feces-laden foods. I do not know of a single human being on the planet who doesn't like poop. And you know who is scared of it? Children. Because the poop is really, really gross.|0
First of all , before I start my review , I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie ' and I must say that the first movie is not as bad as we were told in many of reviews. I will give you a brief explanation. I have been watching this movie for the past 3 years and the movie was released in the first half of January, so I must say that it was a late release. I am not going to waste any time , but what is the point of going through all reviews that are already made about the movie.|0
"Look , do n't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON ! I could barely sit through ""Crocodile Dundee"" and here you are saying it is the best one you have seen. But then come on and try and compare that to ""Jurassic"" and try and compare ""Star Wars"". I just think they both suck. It's like you have a bunch of movies from your childhood you want to watch but you can't find time to sit down and watch them and you tell yourself ""well I've seen them before and I know you will like it"" ."|0
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I hadn't. The movie wasn't scary.The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle. She continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother, and their blind daughter.|1
I concur with the other users comment . Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it is so far away from what has happened over the past 25 yrs . This movie was an amazing movie . It is also one of the best Sci Fi movies out there . This was a movie I wanted to like, but after watching all the other reviews on this page, I thought it was just bad. I'm glad I went in blind! The film is really good. The animation is awesome. The music is great. The story is actually quite interesting.|0
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in Sydney. He did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star.|1
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house that it is based on as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. I know that, because I was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing.|1
In Fassbinder 's earlier films , his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them . He was always a good, if limited, director, but this was a good film with a difficult problem to solve . Not only was it to do with Fassbinder's own problems, but also that of Germany in the middle of the century , and the collapse of the German Democratic Republic , when people were looking for a way out, and not just any way. In Fassbinder's film the question was where to go next , to the West , in a country that was about to fall apart.|0
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. It uses every cliché in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.It is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie.|1
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset.|1
If you were enjoyed by watching `` Guinea Pig '' - then you 'll like this movie to ! ``. It is a movie for everyone and it has a wonderful plot which is full of romance, action and funny scenes. This movie is worth watching even if you are not familiar with the movie genre which is full of action, adventure, comedy, romance and drama and if you want to give this movie a good review, then make sure you watch the movie first of all and then go back to see the review of this movie.|0
Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf, and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.This film has so many good things I can't even say them.|1
UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia.John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property.|1
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it, I expected quite a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly.|1
I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio , but here they were presented as if they were real facts . I can't say I was totally uninterested , but I didn't have any sympathy for the poor man who made them up . I can't say it was as bad as L'Esprit n' le Monde , which was a much worse work of literature . The film was made to entertain the Italian people in the hope that the people of France would be moved to a desire to help Italy .|0
Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue.Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.The plot rambles on.|1
"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster."|1
In London , the Venetian Carla Borin ( Yuliya Mayarchuk ) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved friend. The apartment is on the top of her building, the top floor of a tall building. One of the windows faces on the courtyard. In the courtyard, three men were playing soccer in the winter sun. The men were dressed like football fans: they had jerseys on with a red and yellow flag, a yellow scarf and black shoes. A man came out and shouted that the game must start, so he ran after the men and ordered them to stop the game.|0
From the makers of Underworld , we have , by far , the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen, and I’ve seen some pretty horrible stuff. It is not that the movie was bad. Hell, I liked it, but the movie itself was atrocious. It was the production values that took me aback, to be completely honest, but there are a number of reasons, not least the fact that the lead actor had a very strange name, the name being an anagram, which made me laugh when I heard he was in it.|0
I really do n't think producer George Lucas did n't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as the prequel trilogy for Star Wars: The Clone Wars, but when he decided to move on to something else he didn't feel the need to follow his own ideas of what a prequel trilogy should be like. After all, it was his baby, so if he didn't like its direction he could always make something new and fresh. That's the thing with sequels, they never quite work out how the original idea was conceived.|0
"And one of 'em are bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. This is not the Dante-directed ""Piranha"" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as ""Piranha, Piranha."" A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece."|1
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film , only adds to the mystery surrounding his death. Why would someone take a life like that? It certainly wasn't for the fame or the fortune, and it certainly wasn't the money he'd made from the movie. I've never understood this fascination with people like him. Why did they kill him? I honestly don't know the answer. If you have any more information on this case, feel free to share in the comment section below.|0
This is a wonderful comedy short -- one of Keaton 's absolute best . Through a long series of silly misunderstandings, three brothers ( played by Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton ) are forced to live together in a trailer in the countryside . But it's not the country they're forced into, it's the city . For the first time, Charlie Keaton has the starring role. Chaplin plays his brother's best friend, and the brother's father, as well as a minister, plays the minister's wife.|0
Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion.|1
I liked this movie , the second Naruto feature film . I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad more though. This one was a lot of fun to watch and I had a lot of fun with the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by this Naruto film and loved the way it took the story forward and added in new characters and plot twists . There were also a number of good action scenes , a decent romance plot , and a decent love interest for Sakura . I did wish the movie had more time for the flashbacks , though .|0
This movie really starts strong . We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke, but that's the only thing we know for sure. Roberts is an alcoholic. He also seems to have the hots for an attractive blond in her mid thirties who lives in Sydney. We hear her name at least once but don't know her. The only thing we are sure of is that he's going to hook up with her and take her back with him to Atlanta and that this will be a big problem for her.|0
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see it.In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project. Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor.|1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film 's plot details than I could . What followed was a much more enjoyable film experience, I was amazed at how much better this movie felt than the first, both in narrative terms and the actual visual effects. I had a much better experience viewing this film when I watched it in a cinema rather than at home, as I had the luxury to go into a theatre, rather than watching it over a few nights in my living room (which I would likely have done anyway).|0
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. The film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. But there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. The film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going.|1
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart does n't appear to be in it . . . as the plot unfolds, so does the plot-line . . . of the man who comes out the loser. When it was first shown in the United States it was a popular hit. It has also been shown many times over in the United States since then, but the film has not made a fortune in the States. The film has also been shown in Britain, where it was released in 1951.|0
"Went to the Preview Engagement of `` Grand Champion '' today ( Dallas/Fort Worth , Austin , Snyder and a few others ) . There were about 70 people there and the weather was perfect. I love the Dallas/Fort Worth airport. It is a beautiful city. I would have gone to Austin a while ago if I could have gone to one of the events. I don't know why. Maybe I'll get a chance to go to San Diego . I really don't know what it is. Maybe it is the people there. __________________

"Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain . The film was released in 1949, directed by Fred Zinnemann. It is not a big hit in the United States. Sinatra was in the chorus of this, which was also a musical, called I'll Love You Forever, which was directed by Jerome Moross. The actors who played Sinatra's band were Dick Powell and Margaret Dumont. There wasn't a ""big"" hit after this in the USA, but it made a lot of money here in Britain, particularly in Canada and the Caribbean, and in Australia."|0
I 'd never thought that I would be caught saying this : But I think `` Dog the Bounty Hunter'' was one of the most underrated and underused films from the '90s. It may have been released too late for many, but I'm still going to defend it and say that it is not just the best film of the year, but one of the best films to ever come out of the 1990s. And that makes me really sad because it was made for a very good reason, which you all are going to get to.|0
After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers , the agent Sonni Griffith (Nicolai Gledov) is left behind after he is arrested for carrying a gun without a licence on his person . Sonni is ordered to report to a maximum security prison . In the meantime , a former gang member who was executed by a firing squad for murdering a cop is offered a position as a prison guard in exchange for his testimony against the drug syndicates in his homeland. After a routine search, Sonni is found with a package of cocaine on his person and is arrested.|0
I love this movie . Yes , the main character lies , but that 's why it 's called ``Hollywood 's own'' film . This film made in America is a classic . What I liked in this film was the way of the acting of the characters . As the film tells, it is a film set in America . So , we get to know about America , but at the same time , the film also shows how the life of these American is . Well , what can I say about this film ? I loved it ! The movie starts with a long flashback .|0
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many, but they were still made and I still love them. There is something about them that strikes a chord with people of all ages and genders, and I'm sure this is the same thing that made them successful in the first place. The thing with these two movies that I always notice about them is that if you've never seen a movie of theirs, they are still pretty darn fun to watch.|0
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed.|1
* SPOILERS INCLUDED * Alfred Hitchcock 's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch 's novel was an amazing film and a huge hit at the time, but it didn 't turn out to be an all-time classic - and it didn't get the credit it deserved because it didn't fit into the box the Hollywood studios wanted to put it in. The film stars Cary Grant (as the narrator) and Olivia De Havilland who had previously appeared in Alfred Hitchcock 's classic The Wrong Man (1946). But they also starred in a spin-off called Blithe Spirit , which is about two sisters who are separated during WWII.|0
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois , recently released from prison for theft , as he undertakes the robbery of his brother's jewellery store . he makes the plan with his best friend Paul who has his own plan - he will steal enough jewellery to set himself up in life as a famous movie actor . he is interrupted in the middle of the operation by the police who have been called after a report of a robbery in the same jewellery store . the jewellery was stolen but the police can't find the suspect .|0
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity.|1
If you 're a fan of the original series , do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the start when I saw the first trailer. This movie does nothing for me other than to waste time and keep the series from getting back into theatres.I did not see this until the last day of its run so when I heard about it I assumed it would be terrible and I'm not disappointed. I expected it to be a big time dud.It is not and the only thing I have to recommend it is to see this movie only if you absolutely have to.|0
"Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at ""film noir"". The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The ""non-traditional"" casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder ""what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?"" then the storyteller has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish."|1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted . Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in it's genre . I watched it a few times on my ipod and now i have downloaded it on my laptop and it was even better . The movie had many good acting and i like how they used to the technology of the day . This is a very interesting film that i will definitely watch again . This is the best movie i have seen this year . The movie was so real and the story line was very good . this movie gave the viewers what they really want .|0
I seen this movie when it came out . I thought what an average movie . I have now realized that it was one of the greats . I watched it on the plane, it was the only movie I had seen all the way through. And I thought it was average and what an average movie it was . That movie changed my mind about how I saw movies. I saw a lot of movies before this movie came along, but when I saw it, I knew that this is the movie that changed my outlook on movies.|0
The finest short I 've ever seen . Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened , due to the length , but the overall impression that I got from it was it was more than just a short. I 've seen a few that were shorter , but not ones that was as well-made as this one . . . This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. This movie was not what I had in mind, but this review will explain why. I don 't know what I 've been waiting for to watch this film.|0
"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.The fights are not of high standards. They are way too ""simple"" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success."|1
The 1980's 'My Dinner with Andre,' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'You Are Alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. The story revolves around three principal characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae.|1
"Mixed group of ""experts"" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. The cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-aiming effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels."|1
If a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere.|1
I saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it.Look, I can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. But this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. Oh well, they say love is blind...The neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too.|1
There 's a good story well hidden and never really used ! The film is short and overly dependent on dialogue. The story can be found if you read the book by the same name by the same name by John Updike as it was published in 1967. The movie version was released in the U.S. on July 17th 1968, but was actually a sequel to the book. This is a fictionalized re-telling of an event in U.K. Politics in 1958. The story was written by Oliver Mowat (1892-1971) and was published in the Sunday Times, April 3, 1960.|0
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I am biased to the A&E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth.The characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believable.Darcy was portrayed tolerably well, I will grant him.|1
What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump?|1
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn't have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys.|1
"Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to encountering the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile the Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause trouble in the town, Brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.The original Critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick ""Gremlins"". It became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel."|1
Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all.T hey (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead! He better be put on a lead and stay there!|1
I was looking forward to The Guardian , but when I walked into the theater I was n't really in for it . I was really disappointed with the whole film . It felt like the film was trying too hard . It seemed like The Guardian was trying to be more of a political film , but in actuality the film was really about how easy it was to get people to do what they wanted . It didn't even attempt to make any sense of why people would go down a dark hole to do what they do .|0
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels.|1
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin who used to like it.i did not see the whole movie,but i do remember that it was not a very exciting film,and when they do that scene where the boy and his parents were supposed to be in love it was so lame.i think that this movie is not for kids of that age.in my opinion it is a very dull movie.i have never heard of the movie. I saw this movie at the theater once.|0
But it 's not . The plot is n't all that bad , the actors are n't all terrible so it 's not as though the series is just bad by design . If anything , I actually think it's pretty cool . The fact that it's actually based on a novel about a man who is able to use telekinesis to do anything he wants to do really makes this series stand out . And I do not mean to belittle it in anyway . I'm just stating that there are a lot of things that don 't work together for this show to succeed .|0
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it! Its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name, but once viewing it...will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside. Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made. However, being unique as it is.|1
My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie . I had not seen the movie yet. It had to do with a man who killed two people because he was not going to live in this world without knowing how he lived in the past . It was an excellent movie ! I am not a movie buff as many are. But I just saw this and I will definitely be watching it again. I liked it a great deal . The story was not bad, and it was well written. I liked the way it was told .|0
"Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin. So let me admit first, that I have only seen the first half hour. When the first finger had been chopped off, I thought sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of ""five fingers"" and she immediately followed my example.Couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. This major goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh."|1
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. I did enjoy seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert get eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). Jerri Manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy.|1
I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard they are coming soon.) Commander's Log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. It's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the put-down... I just wish I could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers!|1
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature . Finally ! ! ! This is the time to buy it ! So, this film has just been made into a theatrical flick. I am very excited ! This film is one of my all time favorites. It is very interesting to see this film as a sequel to a film that did not have sequels . I am not sure if it should have sequels, because it was such a great film. I think sequels are not necessary . I have not read the new script , so I cannot tell you about it .|0
`` Problem Child '' was an okay movie , but did it really merit a sequel ? I do n't think so , but I also don't see how it's not better to just make it as an original movie and do a proper sequel. But then again , I do n't have a problem with the idea . The plot is the most important part of a movie . But if the plot doesn't have any interest for you , I suggest you watch the first one instead of a second movie . There were a lot of things I did not like about this film .|0
Like some other people wrote, I'm a die-hard mario fan, and I loved this game. This game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it!Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's that good!)|1
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie this is down right awful. After reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews were so right. I totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow.|1
Ordinarily , Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys ' - James Stewart , Gary Cooper , Henry Fonda , John Wayne , William Boyd , John Carradine - but this time he was dealing with two of his own. Anthony Mann's epic western classic The Searchers is one of the great American westerns of all time. The story of The Searchers unfolds over several decades as a man and a woman, played by Gary Cooper and John Wayne respectively, attempt to find their lost brother after he disappears from a remote Wyoming ranch.|0
I never comment on a film, but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves.|1
"The girls might be prettier if you 're their accompanist or a $ # ! +-faced onlooker . What I'd really like to see is you on the stage, and the rest of the audience cheering and hooting."" ""Gee, thanks, man, it would be great if you were on stage. I'd just love to see you there. Thanks. And I bet if I got to the stage I would be doing what I'm really made of. I just love it. It's all I've got. I just can't get enough."|0
"If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli ""Okkadu"" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of ""Okkadu"" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end."|1
I cant put it any simpler than that , this is a terrible film . I 've worked in the entertainment business for close on 40 years . I have seen hundreds of movies . Yet , I have never before seen such a film , and never since . I do not intend to waste the rest of my life watching this garbage . There are a plethora of better films out there that should be seen . This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen , and I think this is because of the poor direction .|0
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point : the little Vasque town of Obaba . It was the setting of a very popular movie made in 2006, called “Obeba”, which was very popular on its release in France and in other European countries, among which France is the biggest one, but it is very well known in the Far East and has had many translations into Chinese, English and Korean. It is a great movie, and I hope you will like it too. I am very happy that you have watched it.|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work . The opening scenes are as breathtaking as a film as it's made . But it's this sequence where you really get to feel for one of the main characters . A scene with a great performance from a beautiful young actress in the leading role . I wouldn't necessarily call this a love story - in fact it's rather the opposite . You feel that you are with one of the main characters who's going through a bit of a hard time and you can understand what she's going through .|0
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently , it turned out to be exactly what it looked like from the press materials (I didn't actually read the novel, I just went to a preview screening). As a fan of horror, I've been wanting to watch the remake ever since it was announced (and I was excited by the announcement that it was actually going to be made by a major studio) and I didn't have any reservations about it at all. But I was curious about how it would be. Would it be as good or as bad?|0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier.|1
Once again Bronson 's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which ( uncut ) is far too slow-moving, dull, and in need of major editing. We all know that Bronson would never have the patience to make anything so dull as this. It's a waste of his talent in my book but at least the film looks pretty decent. I also feel like the film could have easily been shot in HD, which is why it took so long to make. I'll have to see another one soon to see if it was worth the wait.|0
While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying? ), but all in all and good time.|1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie . Except for the sister . She reminded me of Janice on Friends when she would act like she knew everything. It was ridiculous . . . The storyline was intriguing . . . If the movie had had a decent script , I would have enjoyed it more. I liked the way the film was shot . But , I did not find myself invested in any characters . All of them were stereotypical . It was not the story that kept me watching the movie . It was the acting of the leads .|0
( WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER ) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of what’s going to happen. But then again, there are certain things in the cinema that you’ve got to be a fan of or else you just won’t watch the damn thing. I can’t believe I am about to share this movie with you guys. A movie I’ve been a fan of and even recommended to a few friends and family members (and I am one of those) until I had the opportunity to give it the once over last year.|0
I love old `` monster movies '' for the pure camp value . This one does not disappoint if you were ever a kid who watched monster movies. I remember as a child watching movies like Frankenstein and The Mummy to see how the creatures were created. Now I realize that they were created in the laboratories. This is probably why there was a rule in the lab for scientists not to work on Frankenstein's monster. The rules were that Frankenstein had to be destroyed. This film is still a good movie though. I saw this as a child, but not as much as I had been told.|0
Yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. The acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst i have ever seen. It is a very low budget movie. There is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. Mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol.|1
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies. It was all downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David.|1
"I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. This The Fantastic Four film, complete with the I-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue ""Kill him!...Let him go!"" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides."|1
Lt. Claude ( Claudio Cassinelli ) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by a French family. The captain of the family tells him he will give his men leave and to join him for dinner. As the group walks through the manor and into the dining room, the captain, seeing the group is a mix of English and Americans, asks if they speak English. They do not, but they do speak a little French and are soon joined by a soldier from the French garrison nearby.|0
"It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly 's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent. He made a series of classics, including ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and was one of the greatest comedians the world has known. He was a classically trained singer, pianist and dancer who began his career as a dancer before making his first stage appearance in 1913 at age 20. As a member of a troupe, he sang and danced his way to a vaudeville career in New York's legitimate theater. There he began his acting career, performing at such theaters as Ziegfeld Follies."|0
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead' was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore-I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before watching this.|1
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie.|1
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all!|1
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.As a whole I will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialog was even half way decent in Far Cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.Now besides the fact that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role.|1
Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi , this film does not feel like something you’d expect from a French film; in fact I would say it’s rather far from the usual. It does contain some beautiful moments, but at a price. The film is set in two different countries, one of them in the year 1962. The characters in this film are as different as the countries they come from, with the women dressed in their finest and men in the traditional garb.|0
"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense."|1
I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any, I've never rented any, so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker.|1
Oh , the horror , the unspeakable horror of this film . If you can even call it a film , it's not an action movie or a horror movie , or even a suspense thriller , for that matter . And to add insult to injury , there's absolutely nothing on the surface to tell the viewers that this is actually a serious film , let alone an Academy Award nominated film . For a start , this is the most generic of the bunch and the dialogue , which is usually very good , usually comes off as forced , at best , and at times it is downright insulting .|0
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War. The largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner, the East has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with Band of Brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind.|1
A few yrs ago , I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell as part of her own argument. In that essay Russell’s name was often linked to those of Mary Ann Doane and Susan Howe in passing, but when you look more closely at their writings, she seems to be a fairly consistent figure of feminist thought. Russell, after all, is one of the main sources for the idea that feminism, as a political movement, was an expression of women’s desire to “change” men and that the term “feminism” was itself a misnomer.|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien 's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know about him. For a director who has only directed a few short films he has shown a genius level of technical skill that is hard to believe. There is no reason in the world he can't make it big and he has done everything to try and achieve his dream. The film has everything you would want from a film from this director, the characters, the story, the music, everything, and then some!|0
Historically awful . Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity . One can not keep track of the jokes , and there is always a fresh set of “wackos” to replace the one who failed in the task . It is only after some time that we realize that this kind of humor has nothing in common with comedy or comedy itself , that the laughter is fake . I was watching a show called “The Unbelievers” which was broadcast on Comedy Channel. This show had a lot of similar plots , similar scenarios and the main characters of this series were trying to escape from their own reality.|0
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this. This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one...Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II!The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).|1
This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. I did not laugh one time during the entire movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in America and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. I cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth caring about.|1
Wow . The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid . I realize that this movie was supposed to be a horror movie and I’ll take that. I just felt like it was a very shallow horror movie and not a very good one at that . It was just average . And the acting in this movie didn’t do anyone any justice either . I have seen a lot better acting in horror films . I also really thought that they should have cast John Cusack or any other actor who is into horror as the lead .|0
I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure...|1
"Well , I have to agree with the critics on this one , who all said `` leave it alone , don't bother , just let her go . . ."". . . I think that the best thing she could do is . . . get out of the spotlight , stop giving interviews , stop talking about other people , stop giving interviews , stop writing books about other people. . . . She can do those things from afar, she doesn't have a place in our world . . . ."|0
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected . I was not disappointed , but I expected a lot more from the movie than it gave to me , I will try to tell you the things I noticed from the movie , maybe it will help you to decide if this movie was worth your money or not . So , what happened in the movie ? It takes us to the world of vampires , we follow a young girl who has been raised by vampires .|0
A horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates.|1
"Of all the movies in the history of movies I ca n't imagine someone sitting down and saying , I don ' t want to see this particular film ."" I guess you could call it a cathartic process because the moment of truth came after the screening , ""I don 't want to watch it ."" I said , ""So what's your answer to that ? "" He was a bit taken aback . He actually didn't say what I was expecting him to , he said ,"" I want to see it . "" That 's it !"|0
From the start of `` The Edge Of Love '' , the viewer is transported to the striking world of `` Edge of Love '' , a love story featuring a couple who have been married for 30-some years, but still have many secrets buried in their past. However, it all begins with a very special night on the beach. In the heart-warming love story of `` The Edge Of Love '' , a beautiful couple have finally found each other, but not everyone is ready to accept the couple's commitment to one another.|0
It seems like an exciting prospect , a modern-dress `` Othello '' with Christopher Eccleston , who was so frighteningly right-wing in real life. I could imagine him as Falstaff , the rakish rake in Henry IV . But this is the `` Othello '' I can imagine. He was very tall , about five foot eight , he was blond and blue-eyed, and he had a long narrow head that slanted a bit to his left. He had a sharp nose with a small upturned tip, and a thin mouth with a straight line at the corners. On his forehead was a small blue-purple stain.|0
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some Indians who speak in English and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north Indian plains. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars of India in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.|1
Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. And, as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is no where to be found. Instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character.|1
When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake , I was breathless . I do n't know why she looked so hot , with her skin and her legs , but I was so shocked I could not believe it . So was everybody else . I saw her again in 1997 and she had grown a lot in the intervening years . I have seen her in more films than I care to remember so I can't tell you why she did it, or how she did it. It just did, and it did it very well.|0
This movie is a great film . The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film . Driving, friendship, love, family, work, and so much more . I would definitely recommend this film . I recommend everyone to watch this and see how it can show a different way of living. I like the movie a lot , and it is a good movie because it has good acting , and it is full of good stories . but the problem is it is a bit slow . so I think it needs better editing and a better script .|0
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. So FBI-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police.|1
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be awful.You have the main character going to a party and then the movie cuts to a girl walking down the street, she's wearing an ugly dress. The scene cuts away to the main character walking into the party looking for his friends. The second time we cut to the main character walking down the street is even worse. This girl is so ugly and she looks like she could be one of the gang from The Goonies.The movie takes place in a party that is full of old people.|0
We all know that the world is full of dodgy , rip-off horror films . Some of these can be so bad they could only ever be seen on Netflix and Amazon . Others might only ever make it into the UK , and some of us never see a horror film ever again , and yet some of us would never watch one even if it did get released on DVD . That is why I was pretty impressed with the recent movie ‘ The Boy Who Harnessed the Night ’ . The movie , which was released over a year ago, and has now made its way to DVD and Blu Ray .|0
This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence.|1
"This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these ""super human"" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies!"|1
A small-town schoolteacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! Soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (Samuel L. Jackson).This was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? After all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was an all-around good time.|1
I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who . I 've played them over and over but always have to change the channel because the sound is always in low volume. This one has low volume but a lot of other ones don 't have low volume. It's hard to get to the other channels because they are always in low volume . Is there any way for me to turn the sound off when watching or listening to these videos on dvd's or videos on computer. It's not an issue with my equipment.|0
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who 's a real bastard and he wants to launch a super-nuclear attack so he starts using a super-secret experimental nuclear weapon to blast the shit out of everything, including people that he doesn't even know, because why the hell should he, he thinks that they are going to kill him. And when they try to kill him that is when the movie starts. And then he has to use the sub-base to launch the attack. And then he has to get the people to believe that it really was a nuclear attack or that he did it.|0
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue.|1
What I hoped for ( or even expected ) was the well known `` stop motion '' imagery and extreme attention to detail . However, that wasn't what I got . Not only is the film boring to look at , but you have to sit through several minutes of the same thing over and over again . I would have preferred to have seen it with a little more focus on what was being shown ( at the very least it could have been done in 3 hours ) and a little less focus on the scenery .|0
"The mission to see the movie ""The Cave"" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.The immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. What's he going to look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic?"|1
Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism to the core. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic.|1
Norm ( an ) ally I do n't mind remakes . There are some pretty good ones out there , though , and I think some of them may even be good for me , though , as long as I know when I'm in the mood to watch them and I have the time and money . And of course , they always have to look like they have something new to offer that the original didn t . But , what about remakes that look almost exactly the same ? I don t have to say anything , does it ?|0
It 's hard and I did n't expect it ... But it 's really the worst film , me and my wife and the children are really upset and really unhappy , we have to leave and we 've heard the bad reviews . The movie was so bad , you know it 's not a film that can stand up next to anything else that was ever made . I 've been a big fan of horror since I started watching films on TV in the 60 's and I can n't believe that such a horrible film came out . What do you guys think ?|0
hello all Denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! This show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. Among Denver are other favourite too, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. It is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite.|1
"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER."|1
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence.|1
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination. The are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. It is a film of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. There are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit in. Both Kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them. Next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up, such as the Texas Gov.|1
Having been raised in Canada , I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC . I have seen these short in a number of other countries and a number of times I have had to tell people that these short were NOT real. I have seen these on the internet as well as in many of the news papers in Canada . Here is an example. I am going to take a few minutes to explain this short in its full context so people can see what I mean about this and why this short is so important.|0
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then I could have gone for the ending. I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene.|1
An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun (which turns humans into zombies) and later using his jetpack in his never-ending quest to escape from a collapsing spaceship. While the movie is a bit slow at times and the plot is somewhat convoluted, you will definitely come out of the movie with a greater appreciation for the various alien species from which the movie takes its inspiration. IMDb summary: While attempting to return to Earth, the ship they crashed in is sucked into a wormhole.|0
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler), loopy Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee), and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams).|1

How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me . I made an account on IMDb just to rate this movie and then realized i couldnt rate this movie more than 2.5 stars cause I didnt like the movie .I dont know if it was me but I just couldnt give this a 3rd of 5 stars . Maybe i was just being harsh on the movie too but i really thought this movie was sooo funny . I thought all the jokes were great . I thought the actor did a good job in the movie .|0
"My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction

He’s always told me that you need to have something to be happy, and this is one of them, because he was right when he told me, and I know it now. This is the movie he’s loved for the last few years, and it means so much to me that I can say it’s the only one of his that he ever told me was his favorite."|0
"The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a ""pod"" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film."|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film.|1
"Hello again, I have been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. You forget it is the bugs relating to one another. It was just as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such beautiful color in this movie.I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, that I just can't remember the ""why"" of it.Thanks for listening."|1
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this story use guns. She also discusses the mental health problems that are prevalent in young people today. This is not surprising, considering that a staggering 90 percent of those in jails and prisons are mentally ill and that they make up almost 30 percent of the people who commit murders every year. One of these young people, the one whose name is never mentioned, shot himself in the head in his cell and is still in a coma from the incident.|0
Now , the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films ( House of the dead 2 , for one thing) and it looks like they are going to try and make up for lost time this time out with the release of sci-fi/fantasy epic The Dark Tower . It’s being made by Lionsgate for Fox, which just announced it in mid-February. The film is reportedly about a madman with a gun who travels back in time and changes events in our history in order to change things up a little bit in our world, but this time around it will be set in the future.|0
OK , first of all , who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second , who would do this to an iconic movie series ? The only way this is going to happen is if Universal Studios or some studio that has already bought out the rights to this and is currently working on the 3rd movie to go along with it decides to do it and lets the world know why this movie is being made. I personally think this movie is going to be the worst thing to happen to American cinema , ever.|0
This was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea .. However , it was just a little underwhelming and had too much plot that was going on in the background . I thought the story could have been developed a little bit more and there were more things going on than just the romance . But I can understand why this is not a typical movie and it is not like anything you have ever experienced . If I have to describe this movie it is like a movie you would watch on TV when your mom is on the phone to tell you that your car broke down or you are out of gas .|0
"A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. I especially ""Liked"" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to conservation of the environment. Kyoto, anyone?? And the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... This is why people think Americans have no culture. That, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to Europe to ""see the world"" (i.e."|1

It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched. How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. We have an expression here in the U.K. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly.|1
I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. etc. Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie?|1
Well , some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin. To be honest I have never seen one of these before. Some people would probably be turned off but it’s not the first time I’d seen someone get turned. And I am glad to say that they have made a nice film. I have to say I really enjoyed it. And it was really nice to finally see a film with a diverse cast. The whole film reminded me a bit of The Wolf Man.|0
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night . In all my life I have never heard of such a thing and the town's residents will not speak about it unless you are brave enough to venture into their home and find it for them. I'm not a brave man. I just like this book! This is the third book in a paranormal series that I love! I have not read any of the other books. I don't understand them either but I am looking forward to finding out why they are so different and how they tie in with the other two.|0
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series , and had just watched parts 1-3 , which I really like , so now I decided to watch the 4th part , and of course it's pretty good , however, it did make me think that the movie has no logic whatsoever , from the ending , I expected more , but it was kind of predictable , it was like watching the movie by watching the script . Part 4 was quite a good one , although it was a little slow in the middle , so it was more interesting , but overall a very good one .|0
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Indeed, his sort of daft giddiness bears, to this writer, the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when Mickey is holding down the button in the Tardis), yet brings his own aloof superiority a la McCoy's Doctor as he lets events coalesce around him.|1
"Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word ""STUPID"" over and over again? Probably.This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just excused myself and walked out."|1
This fantasy was utter garbage. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, though.|1
"""The Racketeer"" stars Carol (deprived of the ""e"" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines."|1
"I'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. Rather, I usually run out and see it (If I had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit A (So you can actually say something more than just ""McHale's Navy""). ""Mod Squad"" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking."|1
With a cast like this , I knew the acting would be amazing . Still , I was cautious , but I did not see any major mistakes . Even the small things worked perfectly , and they played them perfectly too . My favorite moment of all is the last scene , when we see all the kids running and crying , with all their toys . I was happy with the acting too . The only thing I could say about this movie was that the actors should have done more research on this subject , and should have done it before they did the movie .|0
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the Caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . Also, it would have been very simple to make. All the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel.|1
"Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film ""A Death in Venice. "" Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition."|1
"Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? Great actors...Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `A List' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after having liked ""Angels & Insects"" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was."|1
This has to be the worst movie i 've seen this year .. and i watch a lot of cable movies . the plot was a total joke . the lead girl was a dumb bitch with no talent . i think you have to admit that that movie was not original or funny or any of that crap . you know what i mean . i think it was dumb , too . the movie was an average movie . not as good as the first season of south park or the first movie . but i think i can watch this one with the kids , since it's not supposed to be good .|0
Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film ? From the opening line `` I think I saw a shooting star,'' through the opening sequence and all the way through the second half of the film, `` the hero is the same man'' or in the words of Benji's dad `` the hero always wins''. There are a few exceptions. There is a fire truck at the beginning and then at the end of the film, but it is not used in a fire scene.|0
"The back of the DVD for this movie raves, ""Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films."" This isn't so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. Flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility."|1
Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being.|1
Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are waiting on the other end of your phone to get you back. The game, being developed by a small London-based development studio, is being described as a mix of The Walking Dead and The Wolf of Wall Street and it's due to be released in October. We got a sneak preview of the Kickstarter project back in February and will tell you more about it later on, but you can see it for yourself in the videos below.|0
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen . it is a tight slapstick film that takes itself far more serious than is needed and makes you feel dumb for laughing at it . it has to be the worst comedy ever made . it starts out with an extremely silly story about a cat who gets a fish . the cat has the fish in its mouth so as to save it from being attacked by a hungry fish and so it gives it to the cat who immediately throws it out in the ocean .|0
"Do n't get me wrong this was fun to watch . It has some nice animation with exception of an early part which had to do with the characters and was rather disappointing. It does look like a pretty solid movie after the first 20 minutes but as I mentioned above there are some pretty big problems with the pacing. I also have to say that while it is a fun and entertaining ride I don't care for the character designs. There is nothing in particular about the characters that looks like a ""cartoon"" look, and it makes the movie feel a bit cheap."|0
It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it `` Bigger and Better than ever before . . . `` The plan was to launch Doctor Who in America by 2005 and then move to London. This meant there was no time to lose and so we set about putting together the cast and scripts. It was the last chance to do something really special for children and the Doctor's friends. We needed to make something that could really be an adventure to be proud of. We needed to make a series that had a real sense of adventure .|0
"Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him. ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" is based on the concept of ""UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD""."|1
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie, which came out a year ago. And I remember thinking, ""Wow! That's awesome that there's another show based on a kid's TV show! It's so original!"" Then I got to see it! And... I don't even know what to say! If you want to watch a really great show about robots, it's a great show, and this one's really fun! There are a lot of amazing things going on!"|0
From the beginning of this film , with it 's `` The Lost boys '' rip off opening sequence , it's obvious there was never going to be a love story here. If anything, this story was always going to have a story that was going to have a love story to it, it's just that the filmmakers wanted to be able to put it in the film and make it feel fresh and new. This movie had all it needed for a successful movie, and it had all it needed for it to be an absolute success.|0
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. I've seen Used Car Dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids but Wow! The plot line seemed OK but the director should have required more from his actors.|1
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard living and hard working. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young upstarts of New Labour.|1
What a crappy movie ! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in the middle of nowhere. But he has to leave his home to go to the big city for work. He has to live there for two years and he will go through a lot of troubles and problems. Then he will get married and live in the city for a year or two. Then he has to leave home to go back to his village. And this movie is made for all those people who have been waiting to see the movie with their family and friends.|0
"""Mr. Bean"", starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was around ten, shortly after it ended, so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes!"|1
"After a meteorite lands in ""Boston"" (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. This isn't."|1
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it , but if any parents are surprised by the fact that their children will see what amounts to an assault on religion on the Disney Channel, they'll find this explanation on the Disney website: ""The movie was meant to show that there's a lot more to life than what's on the surface, including the true power of faith in the human heart."" Well, we can't say we're pleased by that, but that's the sort of thing that a good-hearted parent would say."|0
Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy , about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a family in the country and forced to deal with the problems that result from an unexpected visitor. There are some lovely moments where you can just imagine her and the kids at Christmas, with the snow and mist. There's not much dialogue, but the scenes of family are lovely and Stanwyck is a joy in her role. This is a film that takes a lot of risks. There is a scene, early in the film, when the family dog dies.|0
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough . The acting and plot are n't that impressive , but it will be one of those films which makes you go 'huh ?' in a good way. I really enjoyed this one and will go out of my mind to watch it at some point when I can catch it on DVD . First off , i'd like to say that this movie has a few flaws but not that big of them. It has some interesting ideas in it that could have gone in a number of ways.|0
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie.|1
"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting."|1
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story pulled me in and held my attention. i will definitely watch this again and again. this true story telling at it's best... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz. i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise.|1
Rachel and Chuck Yoman ( Valerie Harper , Gerald McRaney ) , decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family of four. The Yoman family had just arrived from Chicago and didn’t have a lot of time to shop for a home, but they also didn’t know the city. And they don’t know it as well as Valerie Harper ( Rachel), who had come to Los Angeles to find work and a home. So the Yomas found an apartment in Hollywood. Rachel and Chuck decided to take the bus into L.A. in their car.|0
This film , also known as `` do n't look in the basement '' is actually not bad . It has some interesting moments and a few nice scenes , but it really just doesn't give anything of real interest . the film was made , as far as i understand , for the purpose of telling the story of how an american inventor , joseph zucker , and his son joe , developed a new type of air-conditioning which used to be called `` hot '' air '' . in the film there is a scene where the father and son go to see the inventor .|0
You know you 're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you . I 'm okay. I don't think I watch softcore with the right attitude because I know it's stupid but I like to pretend to think I do because it makes me feel good. I also have a little crush on one of the actors in this movie. His name is Ryan Reynolds. I think he looks hot in this movie. I mean I really think he does, you can tell when I watch him and that's the same with the girl who plays his love interest .|0
If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.From simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. Its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends.|1
Yah . I know . It has the name `` Sinatra '' in the title , so how bad can it be, right ? I love Sinatra ! It's just a great, simple, easy to use language for building RESTful Web-APIs. A little bit of OOP here and there is enough for the most seasoned programmer. I know that most programmers are more comfortable in Ruby (and there are quite a few Ruby projects coming from Sinatra). But you know what? I'm not! I'm more comfortable working in a language that was designed with OOP in mind.|0
"With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar-race this year. Part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails in delivering the ""message"" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense)."|1
"Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. The actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.This production offers the disclaimer, ""For dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts"", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a Bible story which needed no drama added."|1
"Countenance ! Antoine Monot , in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith 's Silent Bob , keeps asking for it, but the audience keeps handing it to him. The first two episodes of The Last Man on Earth , which are about a man on a mission to find his sister in a land without people, have left us with more questions than answers. Now we're left with this:

Do we care? Will the show find itself with a cult following when it returns in January? And, for the first time in as long as any of us can remember, does this show make us care?"|0
Whoa . I mean , whoa . I mean , whoa whoa.I saw this movie , waaay back when I was a little boy . I don’t remember the exact words , but I know the gist. The point being that , my family and I were in a movie theater and when I was about 11 , I remember sitting in a seat near the end and wondering what would happen . And , who would come to get me . I had to be at my friend’s house to have a party . If I didn’t have to go to school , would my dad take me .|0
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says. Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. He's not evenfrom Flint. He just says that to keep his ""blue collar"" look. He's from a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean he went to a private school.His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, that sure does seemlike they suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there."|1
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters ( Played by Stephen Root) and tells him about his father. Chappy is going to see Doug because Doug has told him that he's not there yet and also because Chappy doesn't believe Doug and tells him that he thinks Doug would never come back but that Doug will. Chappy tells Doug that he has to get back to work because he doesn't believe what Doug said and tells Doug that he thinks Doug might be going to hell.|0
The St. Francisville Experiment claims `` this ai n't no walk in the woods '' , a direct slap in the face to the men and women who've labored tirelessly over decades to bring St. Francis to the city, a place where so much good has come from their sweat and blood, and that's a real loss for those who still believe in the old ways. The St. Francisville Experiment, as you might expect, has a lot to do with money, and a lot to do with the people who make money from it, and the two don't go hand in hand.|0
At least for me. I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. Also, the singing scene was just weird. I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.As Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense.|1
I love this movie . At first , I did n't expect much of this movie since I did n't expect much from this movie . In fact , I liked this movie and I think this movie is must see . If you are interested to watch this movie , this movie might be a better than your expectation . Now I must say I liked this movie . The movie is great . I must say I must say . Well , at the beginning the story was good but after a while the story got bad . In fact , the story gets so boring .|0
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong, wait and see.|1
This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clichés, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions! !, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!!|1
"If you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. It did for me, at least. I'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the ""underwater shots"" of the ""fish"" ""swimming"". The sound which accompanies those shots is great too.One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as ""The Greatest American Hero"" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since."|1
It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for `` The Sopranos , '' '' '' a series about a fictional New Jersey crime family, '' although I don't know much about it other than that it was released in the late-1990s. I do know that there are some real-life Mafia families in America who are very similar to those in `` The Sopranos ;'' they don't even have to wear wigs in public. But, as a practical matter, it's not an exact parallel.|0
Well , this is about as good as they come . There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a film-maker to a small group of fans , but that is a debate for a different book . What can be asserted is that Hitchcock was a very great director , and a master at conveying emotions . We all love to hate Hitchcock, but in fact he was a genius at conveying human feeling in the way that only he could . He was always at the top of his form . And I love him for that . I think he is a great master , and a much better artist than most directors .|0
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash, some knowledge of movie making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors, and a lot of determination, yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free. Thankfully, I found it in a discount bin somewhere.|1
OK, so this is horror? I get horror - but I don't get horrific. Black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. It's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but I hope not. My question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. Well that's been done before too.|1
`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'.|1
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. This film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way.|1
- Contains 1 spoiler , market with : * * * * * -Not presenting itself as yet another remake or remake/reimagined/remastered version of a game that was first released in the early 90s, or even in the 80s, this is a game that seems to be taking its cues from the Japanese games that it draws from, but without any direct influence. * * * * * - I think that the game does it well, and I think that the gameplay itself is fun. It's just that I really do wish it would have made the story and characters a little more interesting.|0
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well-made American horror film, The Devil's Double. The story of a family's descent into the sinister realm of satanism and blood-letting through the eyes of one of the central characters, is a tale filled with religious imagery, demonic possession, and a whole lot of darkness. It is also a story that can be told from several perspectives. In The Devil's Double (1926) director Jacques Feyder tells the story of a mysterious family who move from the suburbs of Pittsburgh to a small cabin in the forest.|0
"Oh , there are many worse Wayne movies . This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that has always been there. This movie is still entertaining, even though the editing has some problems. The music was fine . The dialogue is funny and the acting is aces. I give it 9.8/10

The problem with Wayne is his over-the-top nature, and the way that he doesn't take criticism from anyone but himself , especially from himself . He always wants to tell us what the movie he's doing is about, but in reality he has no idea, he just likes to be right ."|0
"This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.She is far better here than she was in ""The Out of Towners"". The material, I will admit, is beneath the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.As long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do."|1
A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while it was well-received at the Sundance Film Festival, the film has never been seen in the general public. Now, a new trailer of the film gives us an idea of how far the story has come from it's origins, and the film has also gained a cult following since its release last year. The story centers around a group of friends at an unnamed university in the early-to-mid 2000s, all of whom are in their late 20's.|0
Why couldn't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him.The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans.|1
There's a good story well hidden and never really used! The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. What is left is muddled and superficial.Turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.Watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.|1
"The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called ""Whites"" win. However, the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between."|1
"This movie was beyond awful, it was a pimple on the a*s of the movie industry. I know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud, should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung. I can hear it now, ""You getting' paid?"""|1
Spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . The jokes are n't funny . It's just that we all know what it's like to work with a boss that has no respect or understanding for you . I'm telling my boss today and tell him he should be fired because he was rude and does not respect my opinion , I can't get any work done or I don't want to work with him . This movie is so boring. It was not funny at all. I do not watch any movie with comedy and I have never felt so bored.|0
It may be, although there are still two or three I've missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not.|1
Personally, I have no problem with the acting, nor the script. I do have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Plain and simple.One's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. What were they thinking!? Budget be damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke.Of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. Oh well. What is done is done.|1
When I was five years old , it was my favorite television show . I remembered it was on channel 5, but I couldn’t remember its name. As I’m writing my review of the series it’s been a couple weeks since its finale, I realized I’d never told anyone what the show was called until now. It’s a British series which follows a family during the 1970s. One of the episodes, I think, was about a woman, who was in love with my dad.|0
I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as much as I did. The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. What made this movie for me was the music. If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. Its all about being a rockstar. Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.|1
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let 's make a serial killer movie like Se7en!2.Let 's make the movie a romantic comedy like Say Anything!3.Let 's have an old lady in a nursing home kill the hero.4.Let 's make the movie where the killer goes on a killing spree, but that doesn't matter, he'll be the only character and everyone will like him.5.In the last scene, the killer goes back to his normal life, so the audience won't realize it's him who killed the hero, but it's really him the whole movie.|0
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love . In fact , it makes sex boring by giving the audience so many options . It is about the sexual attraction between a man & woman. The problem is , a man can be sexually attracted to many women but it will never be sexual with the right woman . We are told that the man has to choose his woman . He can have sex with a few women, but he never wants to have a relationship with them. We are forced to think about the choices that a man makes .|0
"I still count ""Police Squad!"" as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that ""Police Squad!"" was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like ""You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan."|1
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATED this film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol.|1
Hehehe . This was one of the best funny road movies ever ! I laughed so I fell out of my seat ! :) I hope you are all well. I am sending a very warm hug to all you guys on your road trips ! :) I will miss you all. Hope to hear all about the trip in a day or two. I am sooooo happy for all of you and hoping you are all doing fine and enjoying the last day of August ! :) :) Have a nice week everyone and stay safe !! Hey all !|0

"I just got back from ""AGS"". After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography ? Give me a break. The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?Aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't ""get it"" .... check."|1
I had to watch this movie for a film class , I suffered the whole time through . I am sorry for this review as i really liked this movie but i would like to know how much of the plot was true or if it was just for entertainment . I give it 6.5/10 as it does not fit the movie genre and it is not even a horror movie . If you can like this movie then go watch it. This is not a bad movie . I would give it 9/10 because it has a lot of scenes where you actually have to look for the next one .|0

The trouble is that he has to take his clothes off before he has any chance with her. The next morning, as they walk to town, the girl is still trying to convince the boy to give her a chance. He takes her home to his place where he gets naked and takes a bath while the girl watches.|0
MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc. ), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture.|1
Two years after leaving the small town of Grover 's Bend due to encountering the Krites , Brad Brown returns to his former home to find his wife has disappeared. However, before he can seek her assistance, he must find his way out of the village without being noticed. After a day of trying to return home, he is spotted by the locals, and Brad's only chance of getting back to his home is to hide. While in hiding he meets a girl named Jodie and begins to discover secrets of his past and why he is being sought.|0
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting , they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will unfold. What’s different this time? Well, there is a lot more than the usual fight to be seen this time and you should be prepared to be overwhelmed by all the action, drama and drama that unfolds. The two leading heroes in the film will be the two biggest baddies ever in the movie world. Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel, who has been in action films for over 100 movies, have been making the most entertaining movies for audiences.|0
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture . It is a monument to what filmmaking once was and what the world can be. The wind and the lion is a sweeping motion picture. It is a monument to what filmmaking once was and what the world can be. But it is also a movie about a young boy and his father, his grandfather, and his grandpa and his grandfather, and his great grandfather who all lived together on an old farmhouse on the Mississippi River for a long time.|0
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.)|1
"If you 're in the middle of a ferocious war and it 's still not clear that you 're going to win, you 're going to lose. "" - General David Petraeus

Thursday, August 06, 2007

The American people have been waiting with bated breath for some time now to know who and what was behind the attacks on September the 11th, 2001 in the US. There was no evidence that Al Qaeda operatives had carried out the attacks; nor was there any evidence to indicate they had anything to do with the bombings at the Twin Towers and The Pentagon."|0
I saw this turkey in the theater , but I had a good time . The special effects are n't too good but they work . And I like the music . But the movie is very boring . I don't get what they are trying to say . It should be fun . It is just not. I do not recommend it for children . They are not mature enough for a movie like this . For adult viewers . Go to the movies . Just don't come home. You can find it at Blockbuster or any other Video Store . Or buy it for a dollar .|0
I love Ustinov 's distinctive , literate narration . And the photography is quiet nice . We put the film on our top-five lists. But we have to admit that we are a little disappointed by it . The plot is not so interesting. I think the film will lose in the public eye , it is too long and boring. But Ustinov is very powerful . I know that Ustinov had been suffering from diabetes for a very long time , but the story of how he did not give up even when he fell from the cliff is truly inspirational .|0
River 's Edge is an excellent film and it 's a shame that it has n't made more of a splash. When it came to the screening of this, I was really pleased to see the audience response. They cheered the ending of the film, especially when the last words of the film were given. And they cheered for their favourite character too. We had a good response, and I'd like to thank all of you. I'm pleased that the film is getting such a good response and I look forward to hearing your comments and thoughts about the film.|0
"It´s all my fault. They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the old TV-series. They were right. While production values are good and the actors themselves (including ""don´t look now"") Julie Christie aren´t that bad, the whole film displays a cheekiness and self-conciousness that clearly is without any justification. A comparison between the Karloff ""Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns 2000"" comes to my mind. In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series."|1
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it , despite the lack of budget. I will not be giving any of my reviews out but will leave them here because they will be good , I have a few of these as gifts for my daughter and I think I am going to give them a test run. It is good to know it is being released on DVD as well. I think it will be worth the rental if you can get a copy. The trailer looks very good. I will have to see the movie when released.|0
I can only think of one reason this movie was released. To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn's memory. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this utter trash. Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.|1
* * * * * I reveal two 'twists ' at the end of the film . Do not read what follows with the expectation that anything will happen. * * * I have to warn you, the plot of the film is so complicated, and the story so complicated, that there is no way I can reveal it fully here. Suffice it to say that what is done in this film is not what I had planned or expected to do; in fact, it is very far removed from the kind of films I usually work on.|0
"Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in ""Danger Signal,"" a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment."|1
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time . The capitalized print which opens the Spanish version has been dubbed in English, but it still has a hypnotic effect on me. The story of how a young boy becomes the first person to be teleported from one time to another is pretty much an adaptation of the Stephen King novel The Stand. This movie was made in 1985 in Spain. I am not sure how long this movie was shown to the American public, but I know it was shown in theaters in the US a couple of times in 1986 before it faded into oblivion.|0
"Like all of the very earliest films, this ""movie"" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout."|1
The positives: It's shot pretty well. Has some interesting peripheral characters. Likable main character (albeit weak).The bad: Plot/story. Editing. Characters wasted. Jessica Alba.I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I don't dislike Jessica Alba--I really wanted to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable.|1
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. The shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.The central performance from Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.The cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films.|1
"Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.On this ""Turkish"" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely Hollywoodish to me), Altioklar is trying to be some sort of Tarantino."|1
What can I say?? This movie has it all...Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my all time favorite movie that I can recite line for line....I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl.. (Hey, I even remember the song by Moon Zappa, do you?) Tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....|1
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.What it's principally lacking is charm.|1
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but does include sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off screen.|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller . It´s definitively NOT a gripping and exciting story, but for me, it´s a good opportunity to get out of a dull and boring story. As a result, it´s very disappointing and disappointing me. If you want to have something different and different from what´s on the surface, this is an excellent choice. But don´t waste your money, it won´t become your favorite story, but something else . I'm sorry, but for me, this story lacks of a certain something.|0
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean.|1
If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline.|1
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap . This anti-Bush propaganda piece has to be the stupidest attack on GWB ever produced on any network. I can't say I agree with everything this program did or said; but it was certainly the dumbest attack on the US Government and the American public from a non-US government source. It's not like the government is doing anything worth mentioning. It's the American public that are being attacked: the Bush administration and all of its minions. This program didn't do anything, it attacked the United States.|0
It 's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir . There just is n't a lot of atmosphere, or even a mood. And the whole plot isn't particularly interesting either. But all that really matters is that the film is enjoyable to me because of the cast and the way they work. That is the real problem with 'Tango & Cash' . It has to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen , yet the casting is good . I have to wonder if that is why it 's such a failure.|0
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . Drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . Hey I think I`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE EVER SEEN or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX EVER SEEN . Oh hold on I`m not married and I`ve never been on honeymoon !|1
... when we all know, no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of Sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. How disappointed was I! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.However me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style.|1
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It kind of careens into 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be Pacino's protégé'. So he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. Does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think of.|1
This is one of the best action films I have seen. Geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'Charly'/gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'Stuart Little'.|1
This movie makes `` Glitter '' look like `` Schindler 's List . '' Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need no introduction. The film was a critical smash last year, the year after their '' Kill Bill '' film, and its box office take has kept the Weinsteins going for the past six years, making the film worth more than $1 billion worldwide, and more than $20 million for each of the pair. This latest installment in the Tarantino-Weinstein series has the blood and thunder of Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson.|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection.|1
"Are you kidding me ? This is quite possibly the worst , amateur movie I 've ever seen . The only good thing about the movie is the special effects, the rest was awful . The acting sucks , the plot is too short , and there 's a lot of plot holes that I 'm sure they could have filled in more detail. I 'm pretty sure you mean ""The Thing"". I just saw it. It was awesome. It was pretty funny too. I don 't really think it is that bad. It's the best one in the series."|0
This is a totally awesome movie ! If you have n't seen it yet , you damn well should . The acting is pretty good as well, and it is really a very good fantasy film to watch . In fact , I think that this is the greatest fantasy film ever made , the greatest film ever made . I loved it , and I cannot wait for the movie to be released . I can't really say much about this movie . In fact , if you have not seen it yet , then I can not say anything , but , if you have , then you should probably see it .|0
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned.|1
I love pop culture, but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this. Then, I seen an episode, and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best one they've had. He fits the character so well. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson.I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks.|1
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of the story. The story of this movie is, in fact, based on a true story which happened a few years into the 21st century. It has nothing to do with aliens invading and taking over the planet. It has to do with a man who went to work every day for many years with little to no sleep. He was one of the millions of Americans who work in an extremely stressful job for many years, never knowing what to expect in the future.|0
"Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the ""magic"" transcends all that other stuff."|1
"This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, Mishima. It jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective."|1
"Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable, and overacted. This movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of ""pee -wee"" sports.Characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.Did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.Typical ""Mafia"" behavior was boring and stereotypical.The dog, however, was so darn cute!!! !"|1
If you 're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series of The Doctor Who series and that it would start in 2011, the good news is you're still in the majority. We're told by the show's head, Steven Moffat, that there will be seven new episodes in all. They will be released on DVD every year. There will be an anniversary special as well. There are no details as to what this will be like as of yet. Moffat recently revealed that he believes there should be more Doctor Who in Doctor Who.|0
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends . Its reputation had preceded it and I had been raised with a high expectation of what it could accomplish. It had everything a movie can have: good acting, a compelling plot, and heart-wrenching emotional depth. I have seen the movie over 25 times since I was a child and every time it left me feeling the same emotion. There are no other movies in my memory that I have been able to connect to as intensely. The only other film that has the ability to make me feel this strongly is my first kiss.|0
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!|1
"No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I 've seen in a long time and one that should be required viewing for any fans of independent cinema. At only a little over 50 minutes long it is also the best short film I've seen since the short film that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1999, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid."" Eddie Monroe, a low budget, low budget film, has the power to put a smile on anyone's face and make them forget just how crappy the movies are these days and take them for what they are."|0
"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. This movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. Steve's rendition of a dying cat during his ""I love what I know"" serenade had me vomiting for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying.

Inappropriate . The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA . Whale Rider should be banned from theaters because this is not an educational film as far as I know . What they did to this movie shows that they are completely incompetent and have no clue how to do ratings . It's so bad that the MPAA thinks they can ban this movie and that they are the only one to do so . What they've done to this movie is absolutely disgraceful . There is no way this film should get an 8 rating , let alone a PG-13 rating .|0
I watched this movie and all I can say is this...I am not a film student, nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don't understand. However, IF I were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...Yep! He's on drugs and I can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly?|1
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book , Prozac Nation , and it really caught my eye when I read through the book and I was really intrigued. It was the book that made me go in and dig for the answer as to why some people are able to overcome their depression. And after reading the book I felt that the answers that were provided were not completely satisfying. I had to read more to find out what was the real answer and why is the answer not the answer. And I found the answer.|0
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle . I've seen so many horror films I can't remember if it's been made in the last 20 years, but at least half the movies I've seen are horror films. I know many who feel the same, but that doesn't mean that there are not horror films and slashers out there worth watching. It is my personal belief that the only reason people go to see slashers and horror movies is that they want to know if they're real or fake.|0
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who' history as its most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-rate new Doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant.|1
This movie was bad on so many levels . The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not act well. Then there is the acting from the cast. They just dont have the acting ability needed to act well for this story. The only acting that I can enjoy is the acting of the director. Even he could not portray his character well . I know he is a talented director and I am not going to say anything about the acting of other actors. This movie had so many things that could make you laugh.|0
Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this.|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike & his mate decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? Well, things backfire when Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of Sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament.|1
If the following sounds tempting , then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie from your local bookstore. But I wouldn't even bother with that since it's so ridiculous, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the film anyway. And I don't recommend seeing the movie in a movie theater either. The plot, plot points and characters are ridiculous to the point where it becomes boring after a half-hour or so and I'm not sure why the people doing the filming decided to make this movie.|0
"The Love Letter (1999): Starring Kate Capshaw, Tom Everett Scott, Tom Selleck, Ellen De Generes, Gloria Stuart, Blythe Danner, Jessica Capshaw, Alice Drummond, Bill Buell, Erik Jensen, Margaret Ann Brady, Walter Covell, Patrick Donnelly, Lucas Hall, Christian Harmony, Christopher Nee, Breanne Smith, Marilyn Rockafellow, Sasha Spielberg, Jack Black.....Director Peter Chan, Screenplay Maria Maggenti.Based on the novel ""The Love Letter"" by Cathleen Schine, Director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big box-office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements."|1
Significant Spoilers! This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.|1
After five years in prison , Tony le Stéphanois ( Jean Servais ) meets his dearest friends Jo ( Carlotta O'Callaghan ) and Jacques ( Jean-Francois Villon ) on the prison bus, with a little surprise waiting for him on the way . But before they can start their friendship, Tony gets a phone call telling him that his father will be released and they have a new mission: To find out how the man who was sentenced to death, who is now on the run, managed to escape from a maximum-security French prison. The story is set in Paris during the French Revolution.|0
Reba sucks . It sucks hard . It 's about this awful country singer attempting comedy . They might as well make it for real. I have nothing to say . Just watch the movie and be sad . I've got nothing to say . Just watch the movie and be sad . There isn't anything good in it . I'm not a bad person . This is a terrible movie . There's nothing interesting in it . There's no plot in it . And you know what else? There isn't anything in it .|0
This is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had I known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist. When finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime.|1
"This isn't ""so bad it's good""--It's ""so bad, it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment""! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even figure out the ""plot"" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" is like saying that ""Gigli"" is like ""Citizen Kane""."|1
"""Rouge"" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. It isn't a sequel of any sort. The very end, which I won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. This film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story."|1
Whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely . The Lone Ranger is not camp , but ``it'' has a definite charm . What it lacks in plot and tension , it more than makes up for in humor , which is one of the most enjoyable aspects of every story . And the cast , in particular , is superb . Not a bad cast , for a story that tries to go for camp , then tries to be realistic . The Lone Ranger was made in a time when Hollywood was making movies for adults in their early twenties .|0
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout."|1
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli 's entry in Mick Garris ' Masters of Horror series of ebooks. I can't recommend it highly enough. There are a lot of really clever ideas going on, and I mean REALLY smart, that I wish Coscarelli would take to more than just his website. I was really surprised by Coscarelli's writing, I think a lot of his short stories are on the level of something you'd find on Locus or elsewhere, and I hope this book finds a home.|0
Personally , I have no problem with the acting , nor the script . I do have a problem with the direction of the movie .I mean , how did they find the right actor for this movie? . How was he casted? . He has been casted in his first movie and is very good , but he has no experience in acting. I mean, he can do it, but I want him to do it the right way, or at least he can do it the easy way. I really want him to do it right , I just want him to do it the easy way.|0
"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"", they are throwing various props around the room."|1
What can I say ? After having read Herbert 's books and loving Lynch 's movie version , I was very intrigued. I had to see it in real life , and boy was I right . I was not disappointed . On a personal note , I will say I thought it could have been better , but there was also a lot of things that worked well in this movie . There was a lot of action , and there were some really cool fight scenes . It had all the action I would expect , and a lot of great dialogue .|0
"I can see what this film was intending to do. Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. The ""reality crime"" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book."|1
My grandad gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. What a bloody mistake.Basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.The first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.The DVD case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained.|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar . Its so nice to see this wonderful movie made into an animated series. Now, to be clear, this show has nothing in common with either of the two most famous animation franchises. (Sorry, Disney, but you're the reason I've been putting off writing this review for the last four weeks. Now I'm just glad this show is on and that I'll have time to enjoy it more in the future.) And it's worth mentioning that this series does have a distinctively Disney flavor.|0
WOW ! ! Talk about a film that divides the audience ! This is a real love it or loath it film. For some it is an easy goer with a few great moments. For some it is one of the most original films to come out in a while and will be one of my favorites as long as I have a projector to see it in. I guess I have one of the most open minds about films and I have to say it was this one that I really fell for. I was pleasantly surprised with the writing, the music, the performances and most of all the visuals.|0
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely associates.Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes.|1
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Monterey/Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant).|1
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film, but with Today You Die, I feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.So here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.There was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. If he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.These days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part.|1
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. We get a pretty good look at super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end WWII. Except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. Note how it's a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. Once through, it's like any-town-USA, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family TV on the blink. Later on we see little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates.|1
Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and Catholics will just holler.Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn.|1
I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny.|1
Having just seen Walt Disney 's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube , I thought I'd do my own take on it and show you what I have found out about the story so far. Now I'm going to have to warn you here that this blog will be long. It will be quite long, but you won't need to use all the links to find out what I have found out because I have done a lot of digging for you and have put all the sources I could find on that page for you.|0
Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics , which is one reason you should never be surprised to find yourself with a bunch of bad reviews after your debut. That’s why I thought I’d take a moment to go through some recent criticism of some of the more popular horror movies in the last two years . I hope you find something that sticks to your nerves, or maybe even something you didn’t know was there . To be completely honest with you, all of this review will be based on first impressions .|0
This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and her children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.This movie is based on a true story--like Jesse James was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader.|1
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's performance of their careers. The film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on DVD.|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist.|1
When this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. Soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. Episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat.|1
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow . I would not think about going to the movies again anytime soon. I thought about seeing it more, but that is about it. I wouldn't pay for it. This movie was not worth my money. I had to put this on my favorites. Very disappointed by this movie but it was not my favorite. This movie made me think it was all about the sex. I could have done without it. It's not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.|0
"I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie . . . This movie will be making my list as one of the very best of 2010! I was fortunate enough to attend and review the premiere screening of this remarkable movie last week. And what a time I had! The movie will be in theaters everywhere from January 5th through March 4th, 2010. One of my all-time-favorite bands, The Eagles, is featured prominently in the film with their iconic ""Hotel California"" song being played at several key scenes."|0
"Heh...I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T&A and the cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of ""Psycho"", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy!"|1
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it . It was one of those movies where you feel like it was worth the rental money, but then after watching it , you end up rewinding and rewinding the movie until it starts to get annoying again. I'm sure this movie will make its way onto the Blu-Ray, but if I were to watch it on my TV (which I am) I'd just get frustrated. I've seen it a number of times before and really like it. It has a very good plot. There are many great scenes.|0
This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could take it back where I got it from.|1
This film is just another waste of time . The plot is ridiculous , forced USA drama . The characters are not believable . There is no action in the film . You will not care how the film ends . Hollywood’s big guns don’t have to fight for a movie anymore. Now they can use social media influencers to make their films. And in a move that has become quite common in the movie and television industries, they are turning to the internet to get their message across, using influencers with the most social media followings to promote their work, according to Variety.|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours, I can't seem to forget this haunting film. A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.The actors, though not that well known are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances.You believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. The direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect.|1
This one 's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already one of the weirdest sci-fi ideas we've seen, and this one is even creepier  because the film takes that idea all the way to the extreme end. It's a very, very bad movie, and it's certainly the kind of thing that will leave you shaking your head after it's over, but if that's what it takes to convince you of what is actually going on in this movie, then by all means see this movie.|0
Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work.|1
This really is a cringe making exercise . Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes from movies that are not even remotely fire fighting . Then I thought it would be fun to do . I thought it would make a great game . And so I wrote a little game . And here is the results , this is not the first game to use the concept of the firefighter tribute . Here is my first one . But it is not exactly a tribute . This is a homage . Which was a game I was working on the other day .|0
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA , CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate version, MY NAME IS BABE. Barbra’s name was removed and replaced by the name of one of her sisters, a name Barbra used only for publicity purposes as a teen. As a young adult, Barbra worked on a book and television specials for CBS, but never produced anything of her own. As her fame and fortune grew, Barbra was often asked to appear as a guest celebrity. Her life changed dramatically when, on August 14, 1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated.|0
The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan . After watching it , I found I couldn't get over how good the story was . This is not a typical Japanese film , because of this , the story is very different , so I have no idea what I'm seeing . What I will say for this film is that it has one of the best score I've heard in many years and it has a very good story and the music does not overshadow it . This is not a typical Japanese film because the story has an Asian feel .|0
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews . This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was poor and the script terrible. I was shocked they allowed such crappy acting to be put in a movie and let it stand on its own merits. And to top that all, it's a horror movie with no scares, it's very slow, and it's very boring. And worst of all , it's about a group of four guys that decide to rob a convenience store. Oh well.|0
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a '1'?I thought ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything COULD be worse.I was wrong. ""Galaxina"" is that rare movie where EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented, ""Who the hell LIT this thing?"" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . ."|1
"I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact isn't at all. Not so much profound for a such subject. ""eternity"" never-ending life. Experiences after death and ""dejavu"". The film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. It's so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The Middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best."|1
"I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say : I was not impressed , not at all, I would even call it bad film , it is just not that good . Story

I was going to say the same when I saw the first trailer for this film . I even had high expectations for this and I was looking forward to see it . As I was waiting for the screening , I was not surprised to hear the trailer that was given by the film makers , it didn't make much of an impact at all ."|0
I would give this a zero if they had that rating . Fun was no fun at all . I did not like the show . The acting and acting was horrendous . The cast and crew really had no idea about what they were doing . In short, I believe this show was the worst thing ever . The only reason I gave it a three star was because they put the show on as late as possible and because the episodes were so awful . I would rather see it on tape . If you have not seen it, watch it and then rate the show .|0
"Also titled--> The Magical Castle--> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. Only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the ""forbidden arts"" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born."|1
"This film was utterly horrible. Stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. Whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. Reminds me of a hack student film, BUT WORSE. Who ever produced this should give up now. I know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this ""fantastic"" as some think ""Dune (1984)"" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. OK, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers."|1
Watched the director 's cut last night ... glad it was free rental , even a dollar would have been too much to pay to watch it , I only had to make my way to the rental store because the first time I watched it , no one at the shop even asked why I had seen the movie . I was told I could watch it again for free , with my name on it so I figured that was the answer to all my questions about it . I just watched it for the first time and thought it was awesome.|0
i did not expect to enjoy this . in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend . after watching it i though that it was not very good . the thing that disappointed me is that it is very slow and the film is very boring . The first half of the film was so boring and slow and i thought it would get better later but then after that it got worse . the film was about a boy who has no friends, he gets a girlfriend and he goes away to a school , the other kids make fun of him .|0
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical.|1
"This movie was absolutely terrible . The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from critics and audiences . Was this movie made because it looked cool or what? I don't know if I could call it ""good"" but there was no way for it to get past the low bar I set for it and still have it make any money. The story is pretty standard and I just don't get what made the audience buy it. At best I can call it average. The acting was pretty bad but I don't see how that makes it great."|0
Wow , I was really disappointed . I was n't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater , but as soon as I read the title I just went and bought my tickets and was not disappointed in the slightest. I would recommend this movie to anyone in my opinion , I really love this film and I'm a true movie buff so i don't mind the fact that the movie has to be shown at the cinema , however , I do feel I was let down by my local cinema here in New Zealand , so maybe I should go and see the film in a real cinema in the future.|0
"Before we start, may I say I hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. Why? Because, after I'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' had appeared on the screen. So don't say you weren't warned.Fred Sears might have directed ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks""), but ""The Giant Claw"" is not that giant a film."|1
I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well... not so bad. Genre: scifi...good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was looking forward to have a relaxing Sunday evening watching it. But but...NO.As in summary, this isn't a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. Movie starts with a epic abduction story: Driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... Well, actually that was the film.|1
Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up.|1
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire . It 's not a hallmark of cinema, it ' s just not a film that should be on the list . There's a lot to be said about the script and the directing style . It's a film that will be considered one of the greatest failures in movie history . The script is a total mess , the acting mediocre and the special effects just laughable . It is an experience like watching a train wreck that leaves you wondering why you bothered to go to see it .|0
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a bore-fest from start to finish, that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. Neil Young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle-of-the-road mediocrity.|1
Have you ever read a book , then seen the movie , and wonder-How did they screw it up so badly. It is hard to believe that they were able to get that to happen in such a short period of time, and I guess the same is true for many books and movies. But this is a great story. The author of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , Stieg Larsson , has just published a new book of short stories. The book was originally supposed to be released in November of last year but was delayed. It was then supposed to be released in June of 2011.|0
Honestly - this short film sucks . the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still not good enough, the music has no soul , the editing is poor ,and the actors are very unimpressive. I'll give it a 10 because of the great story line but the actual acting makes it a 7.5 not worth seeing. I found this one to be the most entertaining of the lot and I'll give it that as well. It's funny, sweet, and the story line keeps me hooked.|0
Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain!|1
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.|1
"""Catchfire"" or ""Backtrack"" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point. Why did she agree to do this? I don't know.The hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.Worst of all, this film features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open."|1
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha/Mostly Martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here.|1
"Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed ""genius"" by anyone who watches it. Is that really what film has become? Or is it that any time someone says ""Wow, that is so cool"" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general."|1
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park . The filmmakers did a poor job with the story and they did not give a chance to the characters to feel as if they're alive. The film does not do anything new and the plot is predictable. If you are a regular viewer of the series then it should not be a problem to you to watch this. However if you are looking for a change in the movie and you're a horror fan, you might just like the film.|0
my girlfriend , as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square , after the movie , says, you know , what is it you said ? what is it you think you can buy ? i say, well , we could sell the movie . i want to be a star . my girlfriend says no , she does not think so. we walk off . this is what happens in every single movie . you never know what to do when the lights come down . the credits roll on in a blink , and the screen turns into black and white .|0
* * Possible Spoilers Ahead * * Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes , they tend to get a little too close to the screen, and that's a good thing. One of the great things about TV is that watching it on TV is often a good reason to stay away from movies. That said, the last season of Dexter is about as good as it gets, and I don't know when you've had that much good TV on one show. So this season, we get more than a dozen great episodes, and they get even better.|0
OK , a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining . Could be worse . I don’t know much about it but it was one of my favorites in my childhood . I think you should watch it if it’s in the theaters this week . It’s about a director trying to find himself and trying to capture what he feels for the camera . The film tells the story of the filmmaker going through the different stages of his life as he tries to find himself .|0
"""Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father""- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her."|1
Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. I'd suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do. Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money.|1
This was a excellent movie . I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching it made me feel better about what is going on . I wish I had this feeling when my own child first started having trouble talking . I wish I had this feeling when my child has his first melt down . These feelings are what are making me feel I am not doing enough . I am very concerned about my child . He is 6 1/2 years old , and has been diagnosed with FAE and is in therapy at school . The movie is so worth it .|0
Man oh man , this was a piece of dog sh # t . I read a few reviews on amazon, and found nothing but hatred, negative comments, and rants of why the author should not have gone ahead with this book. That was not me. In fact, it is not me and that is the whole reason I even bothered to publish this review for the first time. After reading what others have said online, I have come to the conclusion that this book should never have been written. But it was published and it will stay with its author to this very day.|0
I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.I don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'.|1
Jewel Thief is * THE * crime thriller of Bollywood , and why should it not be ? It is written and directed by Gauri Shinde . The cast of this film includes Shah Rukh , Katrina Kaif , Ritesh Deshmukh . The film was released in February 2013 , and was the biggest Bollywood blockbuster ever . The film was a box office failure and failed at the box office , due to lack of public awareness . After a long wait , the film is now available in Indian DVD , which will contain a special features .|0
OK , I read the director 's comment about this movie ( featured as the 'frontmost comment ' ) , I'm so happy to hear about it as well! I 'm just wondering, have you ever heard this story in real life? It's a true story, from the director of this movie who was just talking about this movie yesterday. It was about an Iranian man who saved the lives of 9 people . He saved lives in an accident . His name was Hossein Rahnem . I read his story in the newspapers when he was only 16 years old .|0
"A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy ' adventure through an uncharted cave

The team at the caver's cave have had a rough time over the past three years after the cave was closed down after they discovered a hidden tunnel. We are told it has since been re-opened, but the cave is still very much in use, with people making use of its 'hairy' passages. Caving has become the preserve of the rich and famous, and even if they've never done it before they can always get on a helicopter to experience it."|0
"Yesterday I watched this tv production , and I was very disappointed.I did n't have big expectations when it was released.But the story of the movie is interesting and it makes a good story. But the acting in this movie is not really good. So I'm writing this comment to give a review.I'm not a movie person, but this movie made me very emotional when I saw it.It reminded me a little bit of a movie I saw when I was a child called ""The Sound of Music"".It made me think a lot about what it means to be a parent or to be a good parent."|0
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB . The movie was bad but the actors did an amazing job. There is an episode of the A&E series called Sharknado with a movie clip of Shark Hunter. So, I watched it. The movie starts with a group of divers in a storm in the middle of the ocean. As they dive to try and get to the bottom, they find an animal that can kill sharks. The movie then switches to a man in a helicopter watching a swarm of sharks as it swoops by his sight.|0
"********SPOILER ALERT************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this ""film"". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (Note, the scottish camp director...). ? And who does the shopping for the bog creatures?"|1
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based purely on Flex being in this movie. I have never seen him in anything not worth while. True to form this movie delivered for me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie a lot. I didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should have detailed.|1
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago . . . and, yes, it's a lot of work. A great way to take a break when you need it and to relax after a busy day. I can tell you from having seen it many times that it is definitely worth the work. For me it was the first time it really resonated with my own experiences in the world, so much that I could not stop thinking about it even after the movie was over.|0
... the last time I laughed this much . It 's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he can pull this one off as well as he does and I think it shows that he's an actor of such incredible depth that you feel like you know him on a fundamental level . Atkinson's work as the father in this movie is so well done and the performances he gives to each of his children in the movie are so believable that I could only hope that they'll be able to pull it off onscreen .|0
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow.The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: So if Starbuck thinks she knows where Earth is why not send her out in a Raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust.|1
"Chop Shop . Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart ) . Bahrani specializes in character driven comedy. He was the first filmmaker to break the traditional Hollywood movie studio system in Iran. He then went on to create a franchise of films that have been successful in their homeland and abroad. This is his sixth feature film. Review :

This is a film that will be hard to follow for those who have seen the previous film, The Artist . For those of you who didn't see that , you must see it . Because this is a whole different movie than the other ."|0
I 'm sorry but I just honestly can not see why anyone would actually like this . It 's stereotypical in terms of story, it's generic and it 's not all that funny . I can honestly say that this was a very un-fun movie . It's like watching paint dry... I'm sorry but you have to know that it 's very bad and it 's awful. I 'm glad you liked it but this movie is just not worth even a second of your time. Just my thoughts on this one . I 'm not trying to come off as a dick , I 've just had enough .|0
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back . Knowing it was an obscure, hard-to-find release, I wasn't expecting to find much of interest at all . But it turns out I was wrong . As I watched the film, I realized just how amazing this film is . I was so taken with it I went into it wanting to rewind it all. This is definitely one that you have to own . If you are a movie buff or just have a passion for old horror films, then you should definitely seek this out .|0
Great book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude.|1
I just found out before writing this review that `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' and another movie called `` Curse of The Black Scorpion '' are now available in DVD format. So this review will have to wait until my DVD arrives. When I have time I hope to do another review of each of these. If you have any DVD review requests, let me know. I am not sure if these reviews will take the format of my blog where each review will have the same name and the same description. I will also be changing the name of the movies to be the same names.|0
Not as bad as `` Billy Bathgate '' but close . Try as he might , Warren Beatty just could not resist the allure of the female sex . I won't even bother to try to figure out what the title is , since that's not even close . What we get in the movie are the scenes where Beatty gets to fuck his wife , Susan Sarandon ( who is not in the movie ) and then his wife's assistant , Linda Evans . Warren Beatty can't even get enough sex , and he gets it from both women in the same movie .|0
There 's nothing much to the story . A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she lives, but it's not the money she takes that she thinks she takes. Rather, she thinks she takes a kiss . . . and she keeps that kiss. A young man from New York wants to know why he should marry a woman from Vermont, but he's never before seen so many women in one place in one place. And yet, after a time, he realizes that his love for this woman from Vermont . . .|0
At the time of this writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of Chris Penn. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from.I still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.Anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by Bananarama.|1
Firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. Thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourthly, once a SECOND member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college PRESIDENT will disband the whole class, and NOT turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!|1
"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes? ""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash."|1
"""I remember waiting to be born..."" ""Vision quest that was the American West."" ""We went to a psychic..."" ""I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo"" ""...the place is haunted..."" ""I think there's another dimension right here."" An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner."|1
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential , but nothing more , because boy did you miss out on that , especially after seeing the first one . The second one has a lot of things that i like , and a lot of things that i hate . I think it is very good , but not as good as the first movie . I know the director thinks so too , but i think the film should be better , cause the second one is like half good and half awful . That said , this film is a lot of things .|0
"A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with J.G. ""Pat"" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson concocted the ""gore effects"" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis movies in the late 60s. Lewis remarks that whereas 2,000 MANIACS was a ""five gallon"" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the Lewis-Patterson productions were ""fifteen gallon"" pictures."|1
"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of).The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes."|1
That's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than David Lynch's one! The special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. That's surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six part epic! Check out David Lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!|1
There's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by Bruce Ramsay) are terrorised by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick.|1
"New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow armored car drivers and his boss, who gets the job through the back door so that the robbery isn't detected by the security cameras. The only problem is, the guy is armed with a machine gun. Written by KGF V on behalf of P.S. Entertainment, the film is a loose sequel to the 1985 film ""A Shot In The Dark,"" and was produced by William Grefco. Watch the trailer after the jump."|0
"Korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's ""Mister Lonely"" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion."|1
Well , SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea , and despite the mostly negative responses from fans there, the movie has gotten a solid rating , so it got a very positive review from some Korean critics . It looks like it won’t even be released in the US , but it’s interesting to see how a film gets viewed in other countries . So I decided to watch this movie for the second time , and the first time was the first week of July, when the DVD was released to Korea.|0
Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.|1
I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot.|1
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful ! ! , as it 's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, so bad that you have to laugh to see it. Don't expect a lot of plot here, because we are not given a plot , so this movie is very very boring for me, but we have to see it because it is too late to avoid it ! ! It's not funny, at all, it's just horrible. I saw it on the way home from a movie. I thought I'd enjoy it.|0
This movie was chosen , quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store . It's been on my to do list for years. I am not going to give away what is about to go down , but you can guess pretty much what's going to be about to happen . When it does . You will not believe what happens . You will be so very very surprised . You will think you have not been watching movies at all . This movie will be the best movie you ever have . It is one of the best movies you will ever see in your lifetime !|0
"This forth film in the ""Angel Guts"" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.Nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. Her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. But when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer."|1
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. I'd love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.I am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated.|1
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. It really does grip you. John Paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.I imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but I wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.I think this film should definitely have a wider audience.|1
Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance . Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was one of the best games of its era, with one of the coolest graphics and music you'll ever hear. The last game to have an entirely original sound, it was one of the most influential games of its era (in my opinion) due to its story and music. You play as the titular character, who's been kidnapped and held prisoner, and while he does get to escape, he gets into a bit of a moral conundrum.|0
Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still, even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense.Water has become incredibly rare substance?Well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voilà, water.Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after.|1
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.|1
I have a 4yr old daughter , and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses , now she watches them on TV all the time , she loves all the characters , she loves the stories , so this movie was very cool to watch . i wish i would have seen this movie when i was in the hospital with her 2yrs old , this was so much fun to watch on the computer , my son had a bunch of the dvd's , but this one came out first , it was great to see my baby go to the movies like i did .|0
This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep.|1
After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these.|1
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look.|1
I just finished watching this ( last weekend ) and found it absolutely hillarious , some of the scenes I think might be disturbing but it was an awesome way to pass some time while i was in the hospital. I'm going to pass it along to anyone else who might be on the fence about it . It was funny and I enjoyed it and i would definately be interested in reading the sequel . It will probally make my top 10 if it ever comes to print . This was definately a good movie to pass some time in between surgeries and getting my head around what is going on with me .|0
"I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show ""The Big Valley"". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.And so it was for ""Christmas in Connecticut"" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas."|1
"This is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, ""Watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick. "".What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many that can pull it off like Bob Hoskins but he isn't in this one."|1
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett (A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper... and it delivers just what I'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected it to deliver... and a bit more: Brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale.|1
Great acting , great production values , good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the middle and the end of the movie. A little too long and drawn out. Loved it! I like it a lot. The actors give great performances, even the supporting actors, and there's a lot of heart. There's a great balance between drama and comedy. It's a heart warming love story, with a lot of nice moments. This is an excellent, touching film! There's an interesting plot and some good acting (especially by Kate Beckinsale).|0
"Thank god for this movie . It 's a document of talent that , three decades later , seems even more impressive , and it's hard to believe it is all the work of one woman . It 's also not a great film , but that doesn ' t have anything to do with the movie . If we had to take away a single message , it 's this : "" Don't give up on yourself . "" I loved this movie for two reasons : 1) because it reminded me of all the things I liked about the book . 2) because it was really funny ."|0
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast , Ice-cream , I Scream is actually a comedy film . This is also the first time a Turkish director has made such a film. The plot is about a man named Ali who tries to make it as a famous writer. But the story has to do with two women. The first one is his ex-wife Fatma and her best friend Aliye who both have a secret that they need to hide. As we are going to see in the next two sections of this review.|0
'Do n't Look In the Basement ' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is so good with the bat it is not in any way a secret. In the last 20 years, he has made more first-class appearances for Australia than any other bowler, by a significant margin. He has taken more than 50 wickets for Australia and his record against all Test nations is superior to the records of most other first-class batsmen, though he is still short of a century against England, West Indies and South Africa.|0
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam ( races working together to save humanity, everyone getting along despite major character conflicts and plot twists) combined with an ending that just feels like it was thrown together and slapped together in one half-finished game, it’s no surprise that Mass Effect 2 was an utter disappointment. But before I go into why I think Mass Effect was a disappointment, there are a couple of things I want to say about the series as a whole.|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-TV-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session.|1
One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the scenes...Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow.|1
As someone has already mentioned on this board , it 's very difficult to make a fake documentary . It would take a massive amount of money and effort to make a full length documentary. You don't have that . You have to be lucky and make up enough stuff to convince yourself that it is a documentary . This is not an easy task . However , this documentary is not a full length documentary . It takes only a few minutes of your life , if you want to make sure it works for you . There are many ways to go about this , but most of them are time consuming and laborious.|0
OK , this does n't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part 's opening sequence ; nor to the speed of the second part 's. But I'd say this one's a blast. This was a very enjoyable ride. I found it a little slow for my taste, but a lot more interesting to me. If you are familiar with the movie, then this may not be as hard as the first part, but then again , I didn't enjoy that movie that much. However, this is still quite enjoyable to watch and I'd recommend.|0
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3 . It 's surprising that equal time and money were not more allocated for it. I have no complaint against it for that matter as it is just one of those movies you can 't hate. And for that reason I am giving it a 2.5 /4 . This movie is not really for me. I can 't find anything of any substance in it and I 'm disappointed with what little there is to enjoy about it. For me, it was a waste of time and effort.|0
This movie is dated in so many ways , it 's sensational . You can either laugh at it or cry at it . There ' s no middle ground . The acting is great . There 's never been a better cast in a movie that this . It ' s probably the first time ever you ' ve heard them all together as a team . But one thing is missing from the movie . In the beginning when you hear all these guys talking , they ' ve got a different style of talking . Some of them seem to talk in different ways .|0
"Yahoo Serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. It is right up there with ""Lightning Jack"" and ""Les Patterson Saves the World"" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in Australia Yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy."|1
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I work in the wine business, I had been quite eager to see this documentary, and I wasn't disappointed. Reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten hour series of the film on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing it). The bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long.|1
....is where I'm assuming this movie came from. I mean, I've watched plenty of B movies over the course of my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify this as a B movie. I remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.So the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight.|1
Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction.|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma, being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.|1
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece , or a lemon :

It's quite a relief for those who have longed to see a 'real' documentary film . This one is a real delight for film lovers and film fans. But I must confess that I was disappointed. But as with all documentaries, it makes you see things with fresh eyes, which can only be a good thing. It seems that in this country, a documentary is only acceptable if you can see the subject from a particular angle."|0
WEll first and for most I 'd just like to say that I 'm back out of retirement from writing books and I do hope you'll forgive me and I hope you still read the book. I hope you'll be able to find it. You won't find a copy in any of my books. I don't know why. I've never seen the book. I don't know why. But you won't find a copy of my books in the bookstores. So, that's about it. I 'm now a free man with a lot of money.|0
"This one was truly awful. Watching with fascinated horror, I kept on asking ""why have they done this?"" That is, taken all the scenarios out of ""The Day after Tomorrow"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Twister"" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it."|1
"Well, after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theatre expecting something big. Boy was I disappointed. First of all, the characterizations in the film are SO weird! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgarly shot ""Maaja Maaja""?"|1
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I thought it looked very entertaining. Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time.|1
Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in an automobile accident. One can guess the outcome. Gracie receives Bob's wife's heart, although they have no knowledge of each other....yet! A year later, Gracie is feeling like a new person while Bob is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up on a blind date, Bob finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the date occurs.|1
Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate.|1
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again. i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens after that? is there anymore dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better. i love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK TV series she was in about some nuns? i am wanting to know the name.|1
Interesting cartoon , included on the DVD of `` The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra '' . I especially like the first part with the guy getting his leg amputated and how that works into the plot . But then there are some really good drawings in the middle that are not used in the movie . This is a little known movie from the 80s about a serial killer and a little boy who try to stop him. This movie features a lot of gore but it has a great soundtrack and one of the best lines comes when the mother is driving and is forced to pass the killer who has just cut off her arm.|0
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect . Unlike virtually any other film I can name , The Darkest Hour tells the truth about the war in Afghanistan (as far as I'm aware). It tells the stories of the real people involved in the war and gives a voice to the common people who suffered for it. It does this by focusing on a group of soldiers (not soldiers) who are the only ones to actually witness the war being fought on their streets and in their country, and who have the ability to go and report on the war directly on television.|0
OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.Not to say this movie is not without it's problems.|1
Sappy.I liked how they went to the `` Haaavaad baaa '' to quote books at each other to impress the other on what each has learned.This is how I read books. It's really fun watching this. It's like they are playing a guessing game. This is how I read my favorite novels, but I would love it if you read my novels. I think we have a lot to learn about ourselves and our society. We need to learn to love ourselves and to love others no matter their gender. We don't need to hate each other.|0
For this movie, based off of a TV show, and a serious finale. I thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'M*A*S*H Goodbye, farewell, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like myself) skip this movie.I was a loyal fan of the show Even Stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever.|1
First and foremost I 'd like to state - for the record - that it 's incredibly dumb to call someone 'uneducated' simply because she/he doesn 't understand the term 'prostitution.' I am no stranger to the term 'prostitution,' having been called it and having used it as a reference for several years, having been educated on the topic. However, it 's not an insult, and it isn 't inaccurate. A 'prostitute' or 'prostitute' is someone who engages in sexual relations for a living. I 'd never refer to anyone who engages in any other activity as an 'educated fool.'|0
I love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...I thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. I was very disappointed. The martial arts is also suffering. I am hoping to see a more devoted Segal in his future films.|1
I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.|1
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport . She 's not sure about how much longer she's going to survive as a refugee in Europe. When she arrives in a refugee camp in Austria she gets a job as a waitress. Later Alice Faye has to choose between two guys one who wants to be a politician and another that wants to marry her. But, when one of those guys gets kidnapped she must get the information that will make them safe before it is too late for her.|0
This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal, where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives.|1
The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's.|1
"I go this game and it is alright I guess . I just expected a bit more . The main problem is when they make a mistake , it just doesn't get right . And they don't learn to play on a consistent basis . __________________

Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to the use of his words and images. To the contrary, I found myself enjoying the playfulness of the script, and the script writer’s ability to get away from cliché, even the cliché about women in art and movies. But there is so much in this movie that I found to be very moving, both about the loss of love and the loss of life. I believe it is a testament to the power of film that it is still so moving after more than 60 years.|0
The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960 's Broadway musical that became famous because of its star power. The film also starred Cher and Tommy Lasorda as the film's musical heroes. HAIR had an initial release of 25 theaters and grossed over $3.4 million. In 1986 the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray, and has sold over 1 million units. On May 17, 2016, a documentary about HAIR opened in New York City theaters. In the film, music producer George Wein talks about the production of HAIR and the controversy surrounding the musical.|0
"From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence . Showing Moses as a murderer . People who have no right to live in the country . Why should he die for them ? This is the most powerful novel of all times. ""The world has been waiting for a book which is not merely a book but a work of art, and it will wait a little longer before reading it. You will be astonished."" - A.E. van Vogel

From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence . Showing Moses as a murderer ."|0
Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies . Lots of sex and violence, but if you have a good time, you're on to a winner, and you won't get bored. Some of the dialog is heavy, and the sex scenes are not always of the highest quality (if that is possible in a movie like this). But, I guess if you want to know more about the film, that is what your going to find out. The movie is about a young, beautiful woman who works at a movie theater.|0
Brilliant Aussie movie... A little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line, as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening...|1
Wow -- this movie was really bad! You talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie.|1
"the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career (""there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"")."|1
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. They got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film... Its just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi directed this. I'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film.|1
Not the best of the WIP's, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. Yet the acting, dialogue, preposterous scenarios, and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm. As much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors go to Sybil Danning. Also, special kudos to Henry Silva, who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously.|1
Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets: a walkman, and nudity from Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked there is absolutely NO reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that one. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.|1
This movie made me so angry ! ! Here I am thinking that here 's a new horror movie , where the hero has been kidnapped and put into a strange situation where he has to fight against his enemy . Then he would fight against another . But in the end this movie would show that these people were evil . They would take their revenge on the victim for the death of their son . They would not even spare his wife because she was with him when he was dying . This movie made me angry because I feel that people who are in love should not be treated like this .|0
"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: ""Police Squad - in color"", you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you ever seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry."|1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene.|1
Unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible.|1
"The setup for `` Nature of the Beast '' is ingeniously simple , and fraught with limitless potential for suspense. If you don't read it before starting this one, it will have you wondering: ""Did he really kill that bear, or is he crazy?"" The plot is fairly straightforward enough: A bear is spotted near the cabin of an ex-convict, and it becomes clear that he's holding the animal for someone. The authorities arrive, the suspect is questioned, then a search of his cabin reveals evidence of a bear killing."|0
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. I found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. I'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. With everyone else getting killed, all through the movie I wondered why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brains out.|1
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002."|1

They share their stories of what they do and learn from each other to become great friends. +

This movie was first made in 2004 by ''Film Independent'' with ''The Librarian'' as the second."|0
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap.|1
"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski's ""Curse of the Komodo"", this still sucks...BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in ""Curse of the Komodo"", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........I don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! As in ""Curse of the Komodo"", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island!"|1
I mean, come on! This movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.I was really hoping this would be a good movie.|1
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid . Since I am part of a church that doesn't believe in anything I wouldn't go near it. However, the church I was attending is not very liberal so I can't expect a good experience. There are too many Christians out there like me. If you're a Christian go to a Christian church not a church that doesn't believe in anything. It's really not a bad show, just a bit on the weird side.|0
The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch.|1
'The Shining ' has wit , visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson . 'Ausentes , ' however, can't quite live up to its predecessor. The film has an overbearing plot that, like so many of David Lynch's films, doesn't quite make much sense. The film also doesn't have an effective score (by Angelo Badalamenti ), and there are far too many characters in 'The Shining.' It's difficult to justify spending over three hours to watch just one man and one woman, and one man and a little girl, who are clearly the film's two most memorable characters.|0
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan. I figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15 minute mark , I was begiing the others to let me rip the DVD out and fling it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore it had to get better.They were wrong! This movie was lacking everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it.|1
I caught this movie late night on TV , and was expecting a low-budget campy `` masterpiece '' , I was not wrong. I liked it well enough on first view , but I felt as though there were a couple of issues with it and I didn't quite trust what was going on , but I was going to try to find out more from the critics and then from my own opinion. I don't think I did that well , because it was really too confusing , I just didn't know how to feel and it didn't seem as though they were really trying to do anything.|0
Well , here we have a zombie movie that perhaps is n't even being much of a zombie movie . and that was the first film I saw about the undead . and what struck me as I saw the credits was that the director and the script supervisor were white . that was about the only real surprise . the rest of the movies that are being released and the ones that are being released in this month of february are mostly black and white movies . it's like the horror genre in general is in the last 10 or 15 years . . . . .|0
I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so.What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.Where to start? Okay..1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) No ricochet.|1
I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987.|1
I thought this movie 'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher . Well I was totally wrong . There was a lot more depth in the characters that I thought that this movie was lacking . I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who wants something that is different in a movie . I loved it . It was the perfect combination of suspense and horror that I wanted . I can't wait for the next installment of the series . If I was in a high school I would be so scared to go to class. The killer is so terrifying!|0
I saw this movie once a long time ago , just once , and I did n't know where it was from ,but now I remember , it was so good and funny ! I hope you like this , its the last part , and i hope you have a nice weekend ! And you have to see this movie , it is very good , it is one of the greatest movies that have ever come out . I think i have only seen it once on TV . So you should see it , and yes ,it is in German, but its worth it !|0
Normally , I do not review online , but it 's Saturday and I 'm trapped in my room , so I 've to do a little review on my favorite mobile game to pass the time . There are a lot of mobile games , but I 've to say , this game is awesome . It was a lot of fun to play , very interesting and funny , and the graphics are very nice . I really enjoyed playing this game , so if you have a couple of minutes and you can't do something else , I 've to say that you should spend this time and give it a try .|0
We 've all seen bad movies , well this one takes the cake . I 've seen that Junior movie , ' The Manchurian Candidate '. This is about a Russian spy who , in his attempt to become a spy , kills some spies , which is why the film is now banned in Russia and has to be dubbed . The manchurian-candidate , played by Tom Cruise is a master at being a spy . I 'd say the movie is his best , but you have to admit that you get the feeling , that Cruise plays the role to a tee .|0
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must 've come on and rated me. I didn't understand how bad it was until I looked at this thread. And it wasn't that bad. I have some friends who were there. They weren't on the bus, but they were close to the bus. At the time I was driving my car, I think. Anyway, some of them I don't know. Some of my friends weren't with me. I don't think that I ever told them.|0
I suppose I like this film as well as any I know ; it is not perfect , but understated and realistic enough for its time ( I think ). That's what makes it a masterpiece. It captures the real feel of living as one of us. I do not think it's an American film though ( it is a German movie ). This is a movie with great music ( I am still listening to it today) and great story lines. The characters, the music and the story line make up a masterpiece.|0
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie. There's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations.It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the Illuminati. The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place.|1
Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one Rachel lived at as a child.They say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a Mayberry feel. Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces.|1
Sometimes, things should just not be made. And while the set-up seemed good enough, it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror. But the problem is, its not another Saw film. Its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from Jason Voorhees.I lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film. And generally, it flopped in its attempts. True, telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first, but that grew tiring to watch.|1
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities . It 's an enjoyable 90 minutes , demands little of the audience , and yet has very little to do with the two films which preceded it. The film is a remake of the 1971 horror film The Changeling , which itself was a film remake of an Italian horror film of the same name. It is also the tale of a pair of sisters, both beautiful and mysterious , who share the same blood type, and who happen upon a mysterious house in their town.|0
"I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of African musical - since people break into song every few minutes.None of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a ""tune. ""Karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids I've ever seen. [The actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling."|1
I love Umberto Lenzi 's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT DOGS is one of his very best. But this is the first Lenzi movie I've seen with a villain that is actually scary and not just cartoonish. As a movie, it is very entertaining. It is also pretty much the best movie I've seen so far in terms of storytelling. I didn't really know much about this film and now I am completely intrigued. I saw this film on a very cold day in February in the mountains in the southern Italian countryside.|0
This is most likely the best picture not many will see . It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way that will inspire us to be more creative to make the best work possible and be a part of the change of this country.It was made by a team of great directors that have a history of working with great artists. The people that worked on it had a goal and that was to give us their vision of what should be on the screen. It took them 10 years to make that movie and they all put their heart in it. The script was really great as well.|0
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. You must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. You must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.Firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance.|1
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books ( of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the last) it was an honour when I came across the one and only novel of a writer who was not afraid to tackle the subjects he loved with wit and intelligence. I have read Ik Ook van Jou several times and I always learn new things from his characters. It is a very funny book but not only for me and for my children as I found out that the book had a big influence on a little boy.|0
Ok, when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, maybe one of the greatest B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story isn't bad either. Now I wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.|1
"If you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy ""special"" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! Not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. The special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie."|1
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette.|1
A brash , self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a clash of cultures and personal beliefs, he is drawn into the lives of two different cadets, both of whom are very different from him.When a young cadet dies from an accidental overdose, and his best friend goes missing on an assignment, the two become entangled in a web of danger and lies that threaten to tear apart both their lives.This story is about a cadet in training and his relationship with the Corps he is training to defend and serve in.|0
"This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. ""subversives"" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted ""criminals"" are offered three days in ""Punishment Park"". Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie."|1
This is the essence of the early eighties ! The malls , the credit card machines , the food , all the things of the world of consumer culture . You can hear it on all the radios and music videos you can buy . The mall is a mall is a shopping mall . It has all the good stuff . In this way it has a meaning for people , because it has become what it is . A place where you see the world as a mall. “ The mall was designed to make us feel less alone ‘ The mall is a place of connection .|0
"A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy , self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book and trying to get away with it, a writer named Richard Matheson did something very close to a spoof of SCREAM. In his classic 1967 horror film adaptation of Stephen King's novel, ""It"" (starring Richard Kiel), it's a story in which a high school girl (Dee Wallace) goes home to investigate the mysterious deaths of her classmates in the middle of a horror movie playing on TV at her school."|0
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. Saw is just that.The movie is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility.|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (I'm hesitant to call ""Cimarron"" a ""film"", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it...mainly speaks against it.Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character--an overbearing and over-ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office."|1
When I stepped into the theater, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S.|1

"Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss Sergio Martino's gut-busting ""L'isola degli uomini pesce"" (called ""Screamers"" in the United States). Here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men."|1
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. But i'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst.This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer.|1
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? I ca n t think of any. Even the ones I like least. I have to admit I like it a lot, but I also think there is no such thing as a great movie like this, and that there is no single good movie. Maybe the ones that we do not talk about in the press, because they are just not good enough. I like the ones that everyone thinks are the best, and the ones we don’t think of as great.|0
This movie strayed too far from Straub 's novel for me to enjoy . Barely made it to the middle but it would be better if you didn't know anything about the film . I had no problem believing in the movie and its premise, but it didn't really fit. I'm not going to rewatch the film to confirm my thoughts on it because, frankly, I don't want to spoil anything. I'll say this: this is one of those movies that is so bad that it doesn't really deserve the credit it got.|0
I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old . Only `` The Treasure of the Sierra Madre '' is this old . It is not a story , it is a poem . It is about a man who sets out to find a gold mine , it is a story about how he discovers the treasure . It is a classic that is very good . It is a wonderful film . This is a film that is almost as old as it was in the film world , which means it could be done by someone who has seen it before .|0
"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books."|1
Watching the first few moments , you realize it 's going to be a parody - and certainly it *was* at the very beginning, but there are elements of the movie that make it more than just that . there 's no real story to speak of - the main story is what you'd expect . the movie revolves around the adventures of a young girl named i ( haley joel ) who 's always on the road with her father who 's a librarian. she's always travelling from place to place and it's a mystery to what she's been up to .|0
"For those viewers who thought the 1979 film ""Alien"" the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, ""Night of the Blood Beast,"" made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. In this film, America's first man in space crashlands back on Earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. He later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. The mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?)"|1
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy . It 's hardly a comedy , however , and it can also be very funny . I think it's easy to see how the film would play as a comedy , and how it might play a comedy , too, in the hands of a talented and funny filmmaker . But, I think it's a comedy , even though it's not, and it's hard to see any film that could play that way for comedy's sake . So, what's the deal with it?|0
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. Besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss Jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday.|1
"This is an interesting movie. I think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy ""self-portrait"" of an artist (""I make horror films. If I would make love films, no-one would buy tickets...""). And it's really SEXY movie also: Almost all the time there is some ""action"" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place..."|1
I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are n't stories , but the way he tried to describe it in a way I understand was that this was the truth. It may not seem like it, but that's what I felt. I also find it hard to believe anyone could be so cruel in a movie. There was no way to stop it. I can only say that I hope that the director takes the next movie seriously and tries to improve on his last movie. It was a sad and dark movie, full of despair.|0
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible.|1
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece . The first sequel , Jailhouse 41 , was not as good as the original but was still an epic film . The third was not as good as its predecessor but it still holds up to this day . With all these amazing films there was only one that really stood out from the rest . That was the female convict Scorpion . It was not a good film by any means . There was no plot or story development . It was just a typical female convict thriller .|0
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Still I attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways.|1
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent.|1
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat ' characters were sometimes irritating . Only through the miracle of internet streaming and youtube could I binge watch all the episodes in a matter of weeks. The second season is currently airing with episodes being posted every Thursday and Friday and will resume the show on May 5th with a new episode. What I really liked about this show is the actors who made it so funny and enjoyable in the first season. This season's cast seems to bring in some new faces to the main cast as well as some interesting guest stars.|0
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while . It 's not funny at all , it's not scary at all and its pretty boring . I was really disappointed in this movie and I was wondering , if there is really no one to give me any kind of justice , because it seems like this movie is really boring to me . I don't know but when you think of horror films this one is a must-see . You'll think twice if you won't watch this before going out , it'll give you chills just thinking about it .|0
You may not believe this , but when the credits to this movie rolled , I looked for the director to have his hand in the directing of the first one. So I was really happy to find that he has. I am not sure how it is going for his career but it does not matter. Its a very nice film and I believe the director has a very good story line in his head. I saw this last weekend, and I must say I quite enjoyed it, despite the bad acting and plot.|0
This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs.|1
Low budget , but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. Also, you may want to see how they managed to shoot this as if in 3D. I do think the special effects were quite good for this type of film, but the 3D is a tad over done for the type of films this was. Still I do have a fondness for the Frankenstein story and this is as close as we're going to get to it for now anyway. The cast was quite good and I'm glad there was a bit of diversity in the cast here.|0
`` Strangers on a Train '' was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never thought I would ever find the courage to actually see. But the more I look at it the more I realize how much it influenced me. Strangers on a Train is a film about three different people who meet and form an unlikely friendship. I think this movie is just so much more than that simple story, and I think it speaks to the human experience. It's the story of a man who realizes that he just wants to be near someone for a while.|0
"So many of us who are devoted to the ""art"" of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. Once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this."|1
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension.MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down."|1
It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. I’ve only ever seen one film from him but it was always in a cinema, and that was “Tenebrae“, which I think is an even worse adaptation of “The Man with a Violin”, in which Deodato plays an art dealer who is a member of the Nazi party. I really doubt that the film is even in Italian, it’s obviously a parody, but a good one!|0
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies . My only quibble is that the director , Peter Yates , is not credited for his work . Yates has been nominated three times for an Oscar , winning once , and this is his first nomination . The script is by William Goldman and Ernest Lehman . It was filmed in 1981 in Miami and in 1982 in New Jersey . The music for the soundtrack is by Lalo Schifrin . The film is by Peter Yates . The plot concerns a New York lawyer who wins a $100 million wrongful death verdict for his client, whose body was stolen during a murder trial.|0
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'The Companions'.|1
The plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well . There is a plenty of action , but its all pretty non-event . It is well shot , especially in the closeups of the actors . It is not very good , but it is still good . There are a few scenes where I was a bit annoyed (e.g., a scene where a helicopter lands on a boat , and I had no problem paying to see what was happening ) . I am glad that the plot was left alone, and that there was some action .|0
Thomas Mann 's controversial novel is the basis for the film `` A Death in Venice. `` Although in the film the protagonist is a woman, she is a lesbian. The movie, based on the 1943 novel by Thomas Mann, opens with a scene that takes place on the island of Elba, in Italy. This was the setting for a lesbian love triangle and the film's title refers to the three women. Mann has said that he intended the lesbian love affair to have a romantic edge, and it does have that.|0
"I 'd heard about this movie , but did n't see it until my daughter , who saw it on the cinema , loved the film and asked to see it again. She said ""You should have seen this movie , this film is sooo good , I liked it "". I guess it is a film I will never forget and will remember for many years to come

The film is based on a real-life story, written by William S. Burroughs and his wife, the late Susan Sontag, and published as a short story in 1964 as part of their book, Howl and Other Stories."|0
I love Japanese movies -- having seen at least 100-200 . So it 's obvious I am not afraid of the subtitles, but how do they look? Is Japanese cinema as different from the US cinema as Americans tend to think? Does the language have a certain charm? Do I have to watch all movies in a certain style, if I want a certain feeling from a movie? I 'm a Japanese person, and i love the Japanese movies too, but most of them have been dubbed into English by Hollywood studios. It 's very disappointing.|0
the movie is complete disaster . i do n't know who write scripts for movies like this one , but whoever it was should never ever be employed in this business . this is a disaster in every way . if it were up to me , i would leave this movie right here in the parking lot at my local theater , and never return to it , ever , again . but i am forced to watch it anyway . if you were to ask me what i think of the movie right at the beginning of this review , i would say that this is the worst film i have ever seen .|0
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. We're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.The budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.This film was just so bad. There is nothing in the film even worth watching. The very fact I watched this all the way through stunned me.|1
Robert McKimson 's 'Acrobatty Bunny ' is one of the director 's finest shorts . Although the circus-based setting may not have caught on with the general public until the 1970s, it would be a very strange world indeed if it weren 't for the talent of this Australian film maker. He has directed two other feature films before this one , but as far as his short films were concerned, he has only been able to make one that really stands out. In fact, 'Acrobatty Bunny ' is a true masterpiece of cinema.|0
"""First Snow"" has an intriguing beginning. A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. From this point on the movie plays out like a bloated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience."|1
I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! He gave us the awesome (at it's time)Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to super stardom. Then followed that up with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and Thrills.|1
It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the `` thief '' was the first one to make a joke about a woman who was kidnapped, then had her clothes taken away. But then it went on, in all seriousness, about a woman who was being held hostage in a bank in a small country town.

"OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal -""no really, it's research equipment, the air holes are just an accident""). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there's something to steal."|1
"Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian hospital near the frontline. In a world that is rapidly transforming from a high-tech, high-security battlefield to a war of the body. Sunday, March 30, 2014

I wrote a letter in November to the editor of the Chicago Sun-Times. The story I wrote and published in my letter has not been printed. I have asked the editor to publish it. I will post my letter on my website and on my Facebook page. My letter is no longer available."|0
"Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a ""run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc"" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.There's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse."|1
What can I say ... not much to this one at all . Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are not that impressive.I think they're all pretty much the same, I'm not the best with the English accent so I wouldn't know for sure.I saw it a year after it's release so it doesn't have a special effect. The only reason why I give it 1 star is because it's so boring that I couldn't finish it. In fact I didn't read any of the words and I only really watched the opening and a couple of other parts.|0
a great movie, with a rather unclear political message. it´s shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear, but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie.|1
As a kid , this movie scared me green . As an adult , I could n't stop laughing.I have watched it again and again and again and again, and I still laugh . This is a beautiful tale that will make you cry but also laugh. It is very well written.I am going to be very blunt here , this movie makes me teary eyed and I am crying and laughing at this movie. The only thing that keeps you from enjoying the movie is the fact that you might not like the movie as much as others .|0
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early '80s Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show.|1
"I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $ 6 would be bad . I even went a few weeks with a $ 6 set before I figured out it was a scam .. Here is an example of the type of people who buy this stuff:

I want to point out that this is a scam. That’s because it’s such a scam that the manufacturer is still charging the full $ 6."|0
As a fan of C.J . 's earlier movie , Latter Days , I really wanted to like this film.The problem was it was a complete rip-off of a couple of books I had previously read, in order to fit it in. In the original book, these characters are just as quirky as those in this film. That's fine. I understand that's what the story is about. It just doesn't add up to what we've seen from this film. We meet four college kids in their 20s as they go on an art tour of Italy.|0
Oh boy. Films like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close to truth, then I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a time before WWII started. In the movie, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Well I can't imagine that Rommel wouldn't have known something about Hitler's government policies so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life at the end a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him?|1

His work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days. His latest creation is a (spoiler omitted), but side effects from the process (spoiler omitted),"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. ""Embryo"" opens by promising: ""The film you are about to see is not all science fiction. It is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb."|1
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the Marx Brothers. And trust me, they are paid.As creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really have faith in this turkey. Rather, I think THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate STUDIO 60, which previously graced the peacock network's Monday night lineup.|1
This movie has an outstanding acting, by Marilia Pêra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. The children weren't actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it does happen till today.|1
( Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important you could n't have figured out yourselves ) Yeah , it was a good read . It made me think a little , and it was also nice to have someone to bounce things off of and talk to . I had a great time . Thanks so much . Keep writing and keep reading ... I'll keep reading . Just a few more of these and your writing will not be worth the paper it was printed on anymore , I'm guessing . Thanks again . Keep up the great work .|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13.Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue.|1
For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 , but in general indy films can be hard to rate, they have their own rules and style. I'll try to keep them as similar as I can in this, as I've always thought they were pretty good movies. It's still one of my favourite indies and I've seen all of it. It has its faults, but it does stand the test of time and deserves to be in this poll. I have to disagree with one point, though.|0
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew.|1
in his descriptions of CAA , platinum card lunches in Hollywood , psychoanalysis , a vacation in Provincetown he never took and, most notably, writing about his first sexual relationship. If you’re interested in how I got where I am or, in this case, what I do today, you might be interested in this blog entry from the previous summer. I recently read a new book, “The Grown Up Brain, How To Think & Feel Like An Adult, How To Be An Adult & How To Stop Being One,” by Daniel J. Siegel, Ph.D.|0
When I was a little girl , I absolutely adored The Swan Princess , it was reliving the same fairy tales I’d read over and over, and I always loved it for its “happy” ending. When I watched it as a kid it always hit me right in the heart and I loved it when it was sad, it made me remember how I was feeling at the time and I loved it for that, because I felt like I’d won and I was happy with the win. It was only once I became an adult, I realized what a load of rubbish it was .|0
"I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.The dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?It felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. The stereotypes and jokes about ""men's groups"" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.Apart from the attractive Irish man - this film was a dud."|1
"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! ""The Beginning"" was not the greatest either but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. It's just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. I understand why this movie was redone as ""The Beginning""."|1
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 . Guy Madison leads a team of cowboys against a force of Sioux Indians in a showdown for a lost gold shipment at the Little Bighorn . The film would be the last western to be produced at Paramount Pictures and would be the last production made by Lew Landers after he left to work at Walt Disney Studio. It was a film that would influence a generation of westerns and be the first of its kind to have an African-American cast for a lead.|0
I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born.|1
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of The Demons to beat the dastardly Falcon team who always seems to win at this camp I guess. This being a typical clichéd '80's teen (lame) sex comedy who do you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness. Oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the camp of course).|1
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously . The movie is called Arachina , I have never seen any of the movies you mentioned, I was born in May of the year , so I am just a child when I watch this movie . That's what I like , to see a movie for a new experience for me . The movie is a fantasy , so it has no moral and no story . It's just a story that is told by the movie maker , who has no idea what he's doing .|0
this really is an `` okay '' series .. everyone in it is pretty good . but i just caon't figure out which is which .. so i'm just gonna have to let you know in advance. first up is the show i've been waiting for the longest and in a sense this one is even worse than a lot of others that have come and gone. and this one is the worst because the only good thing about it is that i finally can stop waiting to see it . but the bad thing is that i can't wait until it's over.|0
This is a VERY good movie . I give it a 10.It 's very different in that it 's kind of an allegory about the dangers of living in a society where the rich are always right and everyone else is wrong and no one can get ahead and you have to do what you're told without question.The movie is very well acted and the story very entertaining. I 'm sure you 'll see this movie again if you have the chance. I 'm going to buy it at the theater when it comes out in December.|0
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old Hollywood films. The movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms.|1
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies even get onto DVD. If I saw this in theaters I would get extremely upset. Bone Eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. It's the 'Bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.First of all I thought okay well the DVD artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label it looked scary.|1
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming . Boy , was I ever disappointed . Let's just look at the big picture . What is the Bible about ? A few thousand years ago humans lived on a planet populated with many other species of animals . We lived alongside them but did not co-mingle with them . The only species on our planet that were truly close were the primates . The others lived far away in the rain forests of the rainforests . All the rest of them lived way out in the open .|0
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you.|1
I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie that I hate ... but this was the worst, most repugnant movie I saw in 2010. I had read reviews on the internet of it but decided I would give it a try. On opening night, it was advertised in the cinema and I did not attend, but the next day it was there and I could not believe what I had seen! As I began to watch, it was hard to tell what was going on or what was happening.|0
"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, and anime all at once. The robots are actually called ""replicants"", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for ""heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal""....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films."|1
I must admit , ashamed though I am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favorite films. It is one of the few horror-comics that I did not have to buy. It came to me at a time that was so close to the end of the film-making phase of my career. I had not yet gone the direction that would lead to my first full-length feature and would only get to do a couple of more short films before turning the camera back to the script and camera to complete the script, camera and the film.|0
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found that even the mighty IMDb didn't have it listed. That should have been all I needed to know.With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only one that I gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge.|1
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot doesn't follow on the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense.|1
This version of `` The Magic Flute '' is not only the worst production of Mozart 's great opera that has ever been performed by a major theatre company in England, but it also is the only one of Mozart 's works to which all three of Britain 's leading opera companies have chosen to premiere. The production, designed and directed by the late Sir John Dexter, was a shambolic mess. Dexter, in addition to being Mozart 's most respected and admired stage director, has also been the artistic director of The Royal Opera since 1996.|0
Move over Manos. Back off Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst film ever. The only horror in this thing is watching it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. If this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. It's dreck. No wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck.|1
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller ( as Tim ) throws his sister 's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck ( as Mr Beech ) helps out by fetching her doll. At the same time Mr Beech is looking around the house, looking for the doll that his sister left. Plot

The doll that Daniel is looking for is a Barbie Doll. Joshua Miller (Tim), his sister, is playing with the doll on the floor when she tells him to throw the doll into a river as it is a Barbie. Joshua says that he will do it and takes the doll into the bathroom."|0
I had seen this movie when I was a boy ( Before WWII ) and was surprised that the local cinema in St. Petersburg played it. Never saw the movie again and thought it was a silly story. Now that you mention it, I just saw the movie for the first time recently ( in Russia ). I thought the story was very well written with great cinematografic quality. Maybe the story isn't that great but the story itself is very interesting, and the way the whole thing ended made me very interested in seeing it for the first time.|0
I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve, and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. The extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is.|1
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant , Russ Duritz , who has lots to deal with during his day-job. Like most of his day-work, he has no idea of how to do it well, and as he begins to figure out, he slowly but surely comes to grips with what he does and how to do it properly. There are some pretty great bits of dialogue like the one between Russ and his wife in which he complains about his boring job. And as he gets into this, you begin to understand how Russ sees the world and how he lives his life.|0
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together.|1
Note : After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the film, but as I was about to put up the TV list I just remembered that it is actually a movie, so after the movie review I shall add it to the TV review as that is much better and much longer. I also will add a few pics of the movie review as I believe they deserve their own post, as well as an extra movie list as I have to add a lot of films that I have not seen.|0
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple . Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper , or Bobby Eaton , or Steve Austin , etc. in a battle of strength and determination. In the 1990s the world has grown and grown, and in my opinion is now complex . It has gone past the simple of one man in a ring against another man in the ring, and into a realm of science, technology, business, politics, entertainment, and many other facets of life that make up modern-day life. In wrestling, however, it is just another game.|0
"This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. After a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.We are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. During this stage the film heightens tension with strange ""plinky plinky"" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing."|1
"Distributor : GOODTIMES home video Plot : A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspenseful thriller, adapted from the popular series of books by Joe Lansdale, and starring Jaimz Woolvett (Kurt Russell). A young man on the cusp of adulthood is struck by a tragic event that forever changes him and his family. In trying to cope with the aftermath of this devastating event, the family finds itself on the path to a shocking new chapter in their lives, in this first-person perspective thriller from one of horror's most popular authors and directors."""|0
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto, Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie.|1
Oh what the heck , I 'll reveal the secret : this movie stinks ! Yeah there are some nifty plot twists, but there is no real reason to watch the movie. It is just a boring movie, full of so much plot twists that it becomes impossible to understand the movie. I really enjoyed the movie and am really disappointed in how bad this movie really is. Don't bother with this movie if you don't want to waste your time in watching something that just doesn't deserve your attention. I saw this movie in the cinema.|0
There are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. I really want to add this to my list and I am glad I did not have to go through the pains of paying for viewing. I had read a lot about the movie but I still did not know when I would end up watching it. I just knew that the moment I would end up in this movie. The movie has its flaws but overall this movie has been one of the best movies in a long long time and I highly recommend you watch it.|0
"Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after ""Next Friday"").It's basically just crap. How can you possibly call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, ""Hey, it's realistic, they have been like this."" Fine, but why bother us with it?"|1
This is one of the best martial art ( Kung-fu ) movies of all time . if u love martial arts , then this movie will definitely give you a great sense of thrill and excitement . This is a very good action movie . In this movie , u will enjoy a good fight with lots of action and fights . There are some very good actors in this movie , who played the role of good actors , but unfortunately , their acting is not very good . I do not like bad acting . If u have any suggestion , please tell me .|0
"Did people expect ""Jurassic Park 3"" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil."|1
I just saw this movie for the second time . I first saw it back in the mid-90 's as a teenager . I was hooked the minute it came on . It was so very, very, very entertaining . So I went back to see it again recently and was not disappointed . I loved it as a kid . I loved it as a teen . I love the humor , the dialogue , the action , the story and just everything about it . I just could not believe it . I could not have written a review better .|0
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It’s a story that doesn’t have a ton of action scenes, but just the right amount that make you laugh and feel the drama of the story. This Is The End is one of the best American movies to make in the last 15 years. I recommend it as a great movie for any time of your life, and even if you are not a movie buff, you will enjoy it too because of its clever use of comedy and drama.|0
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end.|1
* * * * Contains Spoilers * * * * As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook , I watched her first season of Pretty Little Liars. Now that the show is in its final two seasons , I am a huge fan of Rachael Leigh Cook's writing and portrayal of the character Hanna Marin. The show has come a long way from it's first season , where Hanna was not a very big name in the show. Now she is a major name in the show and she has grown in power and popularity as an actress.|0
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time . Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by being on the screen , and this film , in my opinion , made him look like the fool . I will admit , the acting is decent , and the dialog is witty . But the film is a train wreck of an idea . And the idea , that is the best thing about this film , is to make the audience believe they know the world of the characters , because we see them , and they know we are there .|0
"I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got. The acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the ""sand map"". It was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic."|1
Korea 's answer to `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' follows a similar story route to its predecessor, but in a different way, and with a very different tone and outcome. And yet it's only a prequel to what will surely be an action-packed final chapter to this most ambitious and most ambitious Korean movie franchise. When this first arrived, it looked like it was just another story from the ever-growing Korean film library, and it was, but the fact that it was set in America made it very interesting, at least compared to many other films of this type.|0
I 've tried watching it twice , though I have n't been able to make through either episode . For those that haven't seen it, the basic concept of the film is as follows (and is very much worth seeing for this reason alone): There's an army that's been sent up against an alien invasion of earth, and what the army has discovered is that they're being held prisoner by another race. A small group of the survivors, including the father of the girl kidnapped by the invading force, attempt an escape, but they're being pursued by the enemy.|0
I know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. However, unless you really love this sort of art or are a Canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish.|1
"Allegedly the ""true story"" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same who funded Columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke Philip of Austria, known as ""The Handsome"" (and played in a rather unispired manner by Italian hunk Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). This is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. It drips destructive lust from start to finish."|1
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film , but with Today I feel I will need to spend some of my time on my phone. I haven't seen this film yet , and was hoping that it might not be as bad as it sounds. I thought the script was a bit long and confusing, and there is a lot to go through . I don't believe in any god , but I have been thinking a lot , and I think we would all like to have the power to see into our future.|0
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! This has got to be one of THE worse movies I've EVER seen! I do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as I watched it!|1
This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story starts out ok but just after a little while it's like the author just stopped and didn't get any further and it's all done in the most unbelievable way. I don't want to give anything away but there is a really good reason to believe that they wanted to put the story down in the last page. I'm not sure why they did it. I'm willing to give it a 9/10 on that but the whole movie was terrible.|0
It 's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure , it 's horror and all, and all that, it's got a story and it's fun, and I get that. But I've been around the film industry a good long time now, and I've only seen one film this year which I actually cared about in the least. It's an awful movie. I hope the film industry goes belly-up in my lifetime, or I will be one of the one-and-only movie fans to see this film in a theater on opening weekend.|0
"Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in ""Save The Tiger"" is Oscar-worthy, I feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.This is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member."|1
Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.It's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are just adequate at best. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed.|1
A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with Bugs, his next trainer. If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon.|1
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.The music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson's.I can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.|1
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees?|1
"An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of a long-lost village. You’d think that by now, I’d be over my obsession with “Lost.”

I mean, the entire series of movies and the books they were based on have been about people trying to find a village in the rain forest in Southeast Asia. In my head, I googled, read books, watched TV shows, watched episodes of the TV series in my entirety."|0
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown . I ca n't say it is any better. I just can't figure out how they think they made it work as well as they did. The author and the illustrator both did a wonderful job and I thought it was a fine book. There are two characters: Dan and Jack, both are good guys, and there are plenty of other good guys to boot, and bad guys. The action takes place in a time period of the 20th century. It is not really about the 20th century, which makes sense.|0
Walt was particularly fond of quality . So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited version? While Disney may have been in a rush to make the movie work, it seems they were also in the process of making the movie work for themselves. One of the first scenes is when we first hear the voice-over explaining how the characters look like they were carved out of a block of wood. This is not the sort of scene you'd want in the middle of the film, where the characters are talking to their friends.|0
"This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome.Any movie that preaches about the ""one true god"" gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism."|1
"This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other ""professional"" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie."|1
Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings.|1
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie . Of course as I 'm sure you know that most of my comments are subjective I am going to use my own personal experiences with this movie as I am not going to comment on others thoughts and opinions about it. From the very beginning this film was a treat. As a teenager I had no idea what a good movie was. I had watched many movies on TV before this one and I have to say those were not good movies to me and I had not the patience to sit through an entire movie to finish the story.|0
This is another of Robert Altman 's underrated films ( let 's be honest , the only movie he 's ever made worth watching ) and I 've actually had to go back and re-watch it more than a few times because it's so damn funny. Altman plays a TV producer ( Richard Benjamin ) who has an idea about a reality TV show where the hosts have to be interviewed and then judged on how they talk, dress, etc. The problem? The host doesn't want to be on the show, but they're being forced.|0
This is one of the most unoriginal , cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen . Even if you did n't see this , you still might think it's great . This was one of my favorite movies of all time . The way the characters react and interact during the movie is so touching that I still can think about it after all these years . It is also a very important movie because it's the one movie that I watched with my father when I was about 3 or 4 . It's a story about family , brotherly love and friendship .|0
"A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character ""Alice"" played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library."|1
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? This is one of those films. It was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity.In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language.|1
See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White. They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. But, watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind.|1
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason they happen to have. What is reality TV if not making fools of yourselves? I'm sure there's a few people who find the whole concept of making fools of themselves entertaining so why not give them a place to do so? I'm sure there are other people who find making fools of themselves funny so there must be people making fools of themselves out there somewhere and you just have to go and see them, right? Right.|0
I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released . Sure , the plot has a lot of violence in it (as does almost any horror movie) and there are some graphic scenes and even some sex (which is always great for shock value!) . But the film is very much worth watching . The story is based on an old legend from the gothic age and is actually quite well written . And the acting and direction is superb . It´s a great piece of cinema and worth watching on a big screen and with a lot of people .|0
Seriously ! You 've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it . It's a very emotional movie . This is why people will go see it . The main character is one of the most likeable guys you ever meet . I 'd like to see how the movie would be with some more characters in it . I really think it's a great film . I 'll post it up here to share my views with you . This is a must go watch . The most likeable guy you ever meet? If it was a woman I would agree with you.|0
... I ca n't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... This is such a slow-moving movie, and I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose. It really takes a lot to drag out a movie like this. I think they should have sped things up if they weren't trying to tell the story that way. It would be better to slow it down, but there are certain scenes in this movie where it is very hard to take in the dialogue. This is such an amazing movie. I am not even sure where to begin with this amazing film.|0
Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. I can't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here folks. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous.|1
"This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies . It may have been considered racy in its time, but its subject matter is still relevant in modern-day society. The film

The film is based on the real-life story of a 17 year old boy who went to a party and shot and killed 13 people with an automatic pistol. While this may sound shocking today, the murder of 13 young people by a young man who was upset over the breakup of his relationship with his girlfriend is still an issue that continues to be discussed and debated in public."|0
I have just seen Today You Die. It is bad, almost very bad.1) The direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad.2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful.|1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer . Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the role, I have to disagree with the other reviewer . I think she played her character very well . She did well with her character and gave the viewers an insight of what was going through her mind . I love how she interacted with her husband. I enjoyed the first two episodes very much and found the third one to be the best . In the end I have to say I was quite satisfied and I did not get bored at any point .|0
Andy McDermott ( Tom Everett Scott ) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad ( Nick Robinson) and Rachel ( Mckenna Fitzpatrick ). The group are on holiday when they come across two men who want to kill them, one with a deadly knife. This is the first movie in the action thriller franchise of The Host , the first two installments of which have won the Oscar for Best Picture. The movie was also the first film to win the Golden Raspberry for Worst Picture ever, and was also banned from being shown in the UK.|0
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement of some of his best friends including Hunter Hayes, who did some interviews, but it would be fair to give it a passing grade. It was really the story that had me hooked and while I was not surprised by some of the revelations, there was very little that I hadn't known before that. I found the whole thing interesting though, so I watched another one the same time called The Last Great Shot.|0
"When the Legends Die is a powerful , moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become the last full-blood Ute in the territory. And, it is the true story of his quest to free a band of Ute Indian warriors from white man’s tyranny. “For a young boy who never knew his father, he had a keen sense of duty, and that is what he wanted to do for a living.”







You’ve probably seen the story “I’m a Legend,” but this is not that story."|0
Mankind 's Self awakening is the theme of `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' , a process that unfolds over the course of seven hundred years of human evolution and is represented as an evolutionary cycle of consciousness development. As part of that evolution, ``2001'' begins with the discovery of the spaceship, the crew, and their mysterious purpose. This story is about how the crew's search to learn about their destination leads them into an epic journey that they will never forget. This movie is rated PG for intense sequences of violence and brief language.|0
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.This movie's story line was onion skin thin.|1
I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene.|1
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century , Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by military historians. Rommel's reputation is due, in large measure, to his ability to survive the German Army's retreat in the final days of the Battle of France and its subsequent surrender on the Elbe River on May 22, 1945, which resulted in the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allies. Rommel was able to continue to work for the new West German government, and he continued to lead his army, which was fighting against Soviet forces in Italy.|0
"I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: ""'Deed Poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes."|1
This movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. To go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing.|1
`` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL . A computer program written by Stanley Kubrick and directed by Stanley Kubrick had a role in the creation of the movie '' 2001 and it is considered a landmark and a masterwork in the science and the film industry. It's a real masterpiece, and it has changed the film industry. The screenplay for the movie '' 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' was written in 1962. The movie had a good budget of $5 million and it has cost $250 million in the making.|0
Almost missed it . While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 ` s , I was channel surfing . In between the commercials for the Phillies , I happened upon a show called The Mike Douglas Interviews . I watched it repeatedly for a few months , and I still remember the first thing that happened . I must have watched a few hundred shows before the Mike Douglas Interviews , but the very first show I saw was the first one I can remember , and I don't remember the show name . I just remember seeing it .|0
Mean spirited , and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children 's tale not only lacks the charm of the original animated film, but the animated film makes you laugh. It's a terrible film for people that don't get jokes. This film is not a good one. It is an okay film, just not great. It is not as good as the classic film and it definitely isn't as good as the sequel. The classic film is just as funny, but it had a bit more of a heart.|0
Watching this odd little adventure movie , it 's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man behind the cult comedy . The same man who wrote the script for The Goonies and The Last Airbender has also made a film about a little girl with a magical sword , and the girl who uses the sword is a little boy with a bow and arrows . The plot is a simple one , a little girl named Tiana ( Emma Stone ) has a magical sword and she goes off with her brother to the village of her grandmother 's house , while her father goes to find his girlfriend in the city .|0
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's about time Hollywood got their act together. The big Studios always frown at edgy material, with Oscar written all over it. Go figure! !JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. It's a masterpiece.Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my film-viewing lifetime.|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, go up to an Arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover there's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is, after a certain dog lashes out, anyone could be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show.|1
"I agree with the guy above , It is so funny I understand it all , but my friends just laugh at how dumb this thread is. If I had to give them advice they would just laugh at me. They keep saying ""oh you got lucky"" and that's why this is so much fun. I have never seen so many replies so fast. I guess I just have to ignore all this. Oh, it's true. We all say this, but that's part of what makes it so much fun."|0
"This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time . The kind of title that ruins a movie so completely , it becomes impossible to find the ending. It's like trying to figure out where you are if you've fallen in the ocean for four hours and can't see a thing. The opening scene is so discombobulating it should be considered the movie's centerpiece . There are three characters, all of whom you know from other films, all playing their parts in this one. Even if you've seen the opening , you'll be asking yourself the question ""How could this be?"""|0
`` Mr. Bean '' , starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson , was a huge hit during its run in the U.S., and it was considered one of the most beloved TV comedies in decades, winning the Emmy for Outstanding Television Series for Children. In Australia, the show's second season was met with a lukewarm critical response and was not renewed for an American run. But the British version is getting a second life. In the U.S., the show has been picked up to be aired on Netflix, and its first season is scheduled to arrive there in July.|0
An absolute classic of 80 's scare flix . This one is n't like any other as it pits pint-size pterodactyl hunters against the flying monsters . It's like the perfect blend of The Lost Boys, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the first film in Alien vs. Predator . It's a must-have for any action fan . This film has never been out in the US and was never even released in France . However, it was made available on videodiscs around Europe . It's currently in circulation and can be ordered from here . I believe there's a copy available in the UK as well .|0
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We'd 100% recommend it, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen, and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did.The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast.|1
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in San Jose. It's a musical, which normally I don't like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q & A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany!|1
Seriously engaging , intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best . Mean , gripping , moody and captivating story , and one of those rare occasions where it is not easy to pin down the exact reason . I liked this film so much when i was in university. I think it's a really good movie. But i didn't really understand the story or even what's going on in this movie. There's a few times I felt that the story was too predictable and it dragged on too much. I just couldn't understand what's actually happening.|0
"Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We picked ""Ik ook van Jou"" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current Dutch filmmaking.The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world."|1
I enjoyed the prequels , and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious . RH3 , however , was just so-so . . . In fact , the movie seemed to take a lot of the lightheartedness away from TPTB . And that's what's sad . . . it doesn't have the emotional weight of the original film . In fact , you have to go back as far as the 1980s in order for it to feel like something from that period . . . and it didn't feel dated . . .|0
This is n't `` so bad it 's good '' -- It 's `` so bad , it violates the rules of the universe that you need to ask why the universe exists . (And if you have a better question to ask, you need to ask it better.) It 's so bad that it 's good, it means you have to ask why it 's so bad that it 's good. I have no idea. I 'm sure there's a good reason for it and I'm sure there isn't one.|0
One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent.|1
I found this an awfully disappointing experience ! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the end of my blog. I hope it helps you. Thank you, I am glad this helped you to decide to not go down this same path. I have a great feeling you won't have any regrets after you have made up your mind... You will find that if you go down this path you'll end up doing more good than anyone could ever ask you to do. I know this because I am doing it.|0
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink ( ! ) , but KvC ai is a much more interesting show, and I don’t think I’ll ever get all the way through it this way. And I’m not going to give away the name of this show because I’ll never get to the end, but I thought you might like to know it’s on Netflix. If you’ve never watched it, I strongly recommend it—it’s so much better than a lot of shows out there.|0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today . Horribly predictable , obscene usage , ridiculous characterizations . And yet it has gained a massive cult following . This show will always be remembered as one of the very worst shows on American television. As a diehard fan of the series, I can safely say that I don't even watch it once a week, but I will watch it at least once a year just to watch the commercials. Why? So I can complain about how stupid this show is . You know what?|0
From the crash of the opening theme , `` The Man With the Golden Arm '' is classic 1950 's screwball comedy . It is a classic that was made by a master director and writer who would go on to create such classic films as `` A Night at the Opera '' , `` Guess Who's Coming to Dinner '' , and, more recently, `` A League of Their Own . '' Indeed, `` The Man With the Golden Arm '' is the very definition of a screwball comedy . It is not only a masterpiece of comedy and film , but a milestone in classic movie making.|0
"Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite ""up-to-par"" sex scenes. That's right another great softcore parody! I enjoyed this film greatly! Sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. But it's like the great god of softcore smut Russ Meyers said ""who really cares what goes down beneath the waist."""|1
This movie , I would like to say , was completely great . I can see how many people would like to watch it , even though it was terrible . The plot was really good . The only problem with the movie , and I would like to say this was my only complaint , was that the movie could have used some more time and energy , and I think it was supposed to be about two days , but the two days was so short . I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody , but I do not think this is worth a movie .|0
First the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, You've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed on just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, Would somebody tell Shirley she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it...if there's no reruns of Andy Griffith on.|1
If you have never heard of Jane Austen , seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation , or read a story by her, you will never get it. Her books have been so heavily edited and transformed into TV miniseries, stage plays and film scripts that they are now impossible to understand. And that's fine. A modern Jane Austen isn't going to be like Jane Austen. She will be a modern version. But the problem is that modern Jane Austen is the very last thing Austen would have written.|0
Yet another in the long line of `` Do n't '' films of the late 70 's and early 80's. As a movie about a gay man growing up in the 80's it was in no way offensive, but it had some problems. The film starts out in the early 80's in a small town in New York where there are not a lot of gay people. One of the main characters is a high-school sweet hearted kid named Andy who falls for a boy from the local football team. He ends up getting in a car crash where he gets very sick.|0
An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment , where it promptly begins to decay until he finally has to get rid of it. While he’s working on the project, he is asked by his friends if he will donate the bed to a local museum . The museum staff decides to ask him if he wants to have a competition to see who could make the most beautiful and functional piece out of the decaying artifact. They award him with $500, and he immediately decides to have the bed reconstructed in his living room.|0
This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades.|1
A genuinely creepy ghost story , full of chills and sensuality , this movie just falls short of what it tries to do. The movie is great and has a very interesting premise, but as for the actual acting , it's a let down with the lack of chemistry in the main characters, especially when it comes to Nick Cage, and not being able to control the way he is supposed to look in the movie (he looks like an angry zombie in the beginning and in a couple of scenes later on).|0
This movie is terrible , it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to turn into an evil killer. This movie ruined my life, I was hoping the movie would make up for what I thought I had missed in the past. Katie Holmes as a character is interesting, though, I guess she can't help but get into trouble. I don't have a problem with that, I know it's going to lead to something great in the end, but it just didn't make any sense in the beginning.|0
Zachary Scott does what he does best , i.e. , plays a worm , in `` Danger Signal , '' the first of the three new Star Trek series on CBS. We'll meet Kirk, Uhura and the rest of the Enterprise crew as the ship and its crew take on a mysterious new menace . In a galaxy that's in turmoil, it's up to Spock (Zachary Scott) to save the day . With a script by J. J. Abrams, an episode directed by Bryan Burk and a cast that includes Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto , Danger Signal will premiere in May.|0
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have had her kids taken away by the Department of Children and Families. Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me.|1
This movie was * good * relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story , from 3 points of view . First: the story of a boy who is in love with a girl. Second: the story of a father who is in love and married to a very beautiful girl . Last: the story of his son who is about to get married to a very beautiful girl , he does not like her. The first part is beautiful and emotional . The second part is more interesting because it has a few things that are not completely true and a lot of things that are really strange .|0
2005 was one of the best year for movies. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence.....Coming up we also got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong....But if this year the only great movie that came out was Everything Is Illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. The first movie as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles.|1

To start with , I have done some further research on the film . Firslty , Jules Dassin directed and produced it and starred with Robert Mitchum . Mitchum , who was also the star of the classic film of The Maltese Falcon , also appeared in several westerns that were made in this time frame . Mitchum would also do several westerns , and they were the type of films he was known to have been in, and it was his style of western that appealed to Dassin when he began the film with Mitchum in the lead role . I found an interesting article on what Jules Dassin did not want for the film .|0
In a world full of films -- like `` You Got Served '' -- that blow your mind with its sheer amount of ideas, ideas like this one seem to be the most creative. But these ideas seem to be popping up from nowhere. Why is this? Why do they seem to appear out of thin air? And how, when you stop to consider what they are actually saying, do we ever come up with them, ourselves? We want to know, so we asked ourselves, and the answer is this.|0
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I guess I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes.These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick?|1
"This is , per se , an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made ? The answer is easy , it's because it's just not good enough to make it as an above average film ? It's not good enough to be taken seriously enough to warrant being made in the same league as other films ? If it is not taken seriously enough (by the masses ) , why is it even made ? There are better films out there to fill the same shoes that "" A Hijra "" has."|0
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old . I remember loving it because it was really funny . I also remember how much I liked it , but it was a bit long . Thats why I remember it , as I found it a bit boring at the time , but today , having watched it again as a grown up , this time as a teenager , I’ve realised that this is a very entertaining movie , if you are the type of person who like funny movies .|0
Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue.|1
...and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. Some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. A lot of people think Troma's Terror Firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but I'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck.|1
The animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After having watched Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. But they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.Otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. I always like hearing the silly voice-overs. They never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of weird looking bugs were cool too.|1
Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real.David Tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.But now Billie has left and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe).|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating . If you 're trying to impress some one on the first date they might ask for a copy of this film. The film's narrative is unique in that it is the story of a female ninja (Mikie Fazekas) who is forced to retire from the ninja ranks. In order to pay for her retirement she works as a waitress in a small town bar. While waiting on customers and waiting for her car to be serviced she gets a call from her mother.|0
Anyone that is looking for an episode of `` Law and Order '' or `` CSI '' would have to be blind not to see or read or listen to them for years. What many of us have not yet heard is the true story of John Bresciani. John Bresciani is the man who wrote ``Law and Order: Crime and Punishment,'' which was originally broadcast on March 6, 1987, and was the longest running drama in network television history (and at the time the most popular drama in network television history) with more than 12 million viewers a night.|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his work, both in and out of the ring, but had never seen him do this kind of thing for long stretches. He needs to start doing stuff like this more in the future, and I hope he continues to do them. He looks to the future with confidence. It's good to see a fighter who is taking things as they come, rather than waiting on things to hit him from a long distance ... and when they do, he makes them count.|0
What a terrible misfire . Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda , who is still in her prime . She had the right idea but she chose not to go for it . It's not about the title it's the message . This movie will never make it . What a shame . I'm really disappointed . I will never watch this flick again . It's a huge let down . I really don't have much to say other than I really don't understand how anyone thinks this is a good movie.|0
**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake.|1
Oh, dear! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. I wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him.|1
This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. There are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device.My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. The product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement.|1
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp . The animation and voice acting were done by Atsuhiro Nakamura. The story is based off of the book written and illustrated by Yoko Ogawa . It takes place in Tokyo. In the series, he starts out by selling cigarettes. Soon, he will be able to take money for sex. He then has a change in heart, deciding he is better off helping women and selling them cigarettes instead. This would make his life a little easier. Soon he would be making a fortune selling women cigarettes.|0
Korine 's established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive image-maker . The promotional posters for Mister No , the manga about a man who dreams of becoming a video game designer , are the perfect examples . The first thing you notice about the series , and the first thing you may have noticed if you had paid attention to it , was the artwork . This was the first manga to be animated by Production I.G 's Production I.G , and it is now considered one of the most remarkable anime to this day ( in my opinion .|0
This movie was beyond awful , it was a pimple on the a * s of the movie industry . This movie is just a lame attempt to make more cash from the same tired tired ideas and to try to exploit the same old tired characters in a movie that has already been done . I would much rather see a good movie , but this is a great waste of time . I give this movie the worst rating I can give it , and it's not very good at all . The music is not very good and it's a very disappointing movie .|0
Two little girls strike a friendship . One tries to convince the other she 's a witch . The other tries to get the girl to be her friend . But is this the right way to make friends? In a small town, there are three sisters who all have two little sisters. One sister says to her other sister that her sister is a witch. The other sister says to the other sister that she isn't, that she only has two little sisters and they will both grow up and be grown up women . The girls become good friends.|0
Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. When entering this, I noted that it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was neither!|1
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera 's Eve watching an amazing drama. After reading about the series in the recent issue of The Times of India, I thought to myself, what could it possibly mean to me? That was my first thought. To this day, I still don't have a clue. But then, like most people, there are those times that we come up with ideas. This is one of those times. This drama was a complete shock. And it has stayed in my mind even though I didn't watch it.|0
This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. If this weren't bad enough, some guy named Count de Sade is living there as well. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. Anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs.|1
"The setup for ""Nature of the Beast"" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Sort of like ""The Hitcher"" meets ""Psycho."" One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems!"|1
For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.Bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!|1
I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool . The DVD case touted so much that I figured it was worth $5.99. It didn't cost $5.99! It cost 3 cents. You can find it today for free on Amazon, but you better hurry because it's on sale for only $1.99 at this writing. I was thrilled to find that this great movie is available for a buck, but I was even more surprised that I have the DVD case, and that my wife has the movie for free.|0
Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture.|1
When a movie 's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen 's younger , less known brother stars in it , it's important to know who that actor really is. The son of Martin Sheen and Joan Collins , the child of movie royalty , the boy actor has always been about as good as it gets. There is no actor in Hollywood better known for the role of a young adult who's lost everything. In fact , the only actor in the world as universally recognized for playing such a troubled character is Robert Downey, Jr 's character in ' A Christmas Story .|0
"In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi ( e.g . The Score and its opines ), one would probably need to be very talented, have lots of contacts, be willing to do any kind of risky or dangerous thing , have a large amount of cash, be in touch with the right people , etc. In other words one would need to be at the top of the class. But that is no way to run a government. Here I have a small sample of the sort of things I am referring to:

"When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases , we decided to get it despite the fact that it did not work. This is really disappointing. I hope they can fix this issue. Please let me know in case anyone knows how to use this

This app is awesome but unfortunately it is impossible for me to use it for more than 1 phone. The only way to use it is with a single phone. I want this app for my two phones. Can anyone please fix this problem and give me a solution."|0
THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars)Pretty poor movie... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his inept son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life. After throwing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I guess is *never* going to act in anything other than TV movies or low budget direct-to-video trash ever again) is called to the scene.|1
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making , it 's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you have to watch a film, then watch a film. There are far better choices in terms of films available for viewing at the cinema. That said , if you enjoy this type of material , then I believe there is some merit to it. The film really is not bad, in fact it's very good. However it's nothing special in comparison with other films made of the time period.It would have been interesting to see a film such as this in the 70s/80s but not in the 90s.|0
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget.|1
I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'.While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made.A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations?|1
"Formulaic to the max. Neither title reflects the serial's actual content, ""Fighting Nazis in Morocco,"" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too."|1
In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost.|1
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it.|1
"Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film? From the opening line ""I'm getting too old for this"" through the ""antics"" of the firemen, to the ""worrisome wife"" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at Disney (""Our studies show that audiences really like it when..."" and then they stuck it in).There is nothing original here."|1
It's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre I find that Novo is an insult to Se Souvenirs.|1
And obviously I didn't see it! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.Did Jason Gedrick really decline this?|1
"This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the ""gray"" characters turn ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.Which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place."|1
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter!|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike ( David Zelina ) & his mates decide to to give it one more go at beating their highschool bullies. What seems to be an ordinary day for Mike quickly turns sour when his friend Sam ( Alex Pettyfer ) turns his back on him and the group goes on the hunt to settle the score. They soon find they're not the only ones who are hunting their bullies, and soon find that things are only going to get more insane as they all become hunted in the most bizarre way.|0
"whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful ""Chappy"" Sinclair."|1
Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .Corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . Ed Nelson a very competent actor got started with Corman as well as many other favorites who show up in Superman and many of the westerns of the day . The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it .|1
I , like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be a small, dark, and drearier screening. Instead, I found a film that I can’t get enough of as I wait for my copy to arrive for review. For the past couple of months, I have been waiting for the opportunity to revisit this movie. I had only seen the movie once a long time ago and I knew that I would have to sit through the entire movie in order to do so.|0
This rendition of `` Noah 's Ark '' has set Hallmark 's ( and Turner 's ) reputation back about 20 years. It is, in my view, far superior to the '60s version, and it is one of the most visually striking shows that they have put together in many years - at least at Hallmark. I loved it, and so did several of my family, so I am posting it on my blog. And, because I love it too much to let it go unmentioned, I am offering a free download of it in .avi format.|0
"This has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. The ""special effects"" ( Spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. I have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end."|1
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin.|1
Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film `` experts . '' and this one is no exception. Piper is the best of the best and if you have watched his other films you will be amazed how well he captures the emotions of the characters. He gets the best performances from the cast as well. But this film is one of his worst. I have never been a fan of his work and his films are always the best. This film is one of them.|0
`` Cat In The Brain '' is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like the work of a film script than that of a film. The series has had a number of filmmakers working on the scripts, many of them with varying degrees of success. It has been described by director Paul Haggis as one of the most violent films of all time and by writer/director David O. Russell in a New York Times review of ''Bad Lieutenant'' as being his '''most horrifying'' film'.|0
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars???|1
"Dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and Todd is his Masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale- ""A Little Priest"" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy."|1
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad. This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and cliché', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch this on lifetime, I'd recommend it highly as a comedy.|1
Ineffectual , molly-coddled , self-pitying , lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard . After losing both of his babies in a car crash, he’s on a quest to prove the world wrong about the evils of contraception, abortion and the evil of marriage, all while raising his three children with the help of her two nannies. And just in case he doesn’t win the Nobel peace prize by the time he gets his Ph.D., she does it all with a smile on her lips . . . or is it a smiley face?|0
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks ? I know , become a prostitute and get paid to be fucked. If only there were more good looking men out there with good money in their pocket so they can afford to become a porno star and take home a big paycheck every week. Unfortunately, there are very few good looking people out there with good money to spare. One of the reasons for that is all the good looking women out there that are married and pregnant.|0
I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful , predictable , embarrassing movie even a 3-star review (and it was just given a 1-star rating for the bad acting, which makes me think they gave it the lowest rating out of all their reviews) . I'll just leave it at that. If you want more on the movie, check out the film's IMDB listing. I do not care for this movie at all but I have to give credit where it is deserved. I have to give credit where it's due.|0
John Knowles modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, are one of many subtle, and subtly is the watch word, themes of love, hate, jealously, denial and regret. The 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - A love story with war looming in the background. The 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story. What is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes maybe it is arguable, a gay love story.|1
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work.|1
This movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. And the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time.|1
"I 've seen various Hamlets , and I 've taught the play . As I watch Jacobi , I 'm thinking of one line in one play of Hamlet 's , which is spoken by the Prince before his murder. The line says , ""What was I doing when you first took me in your arms ?"" It is a difficult line , and it might seem strange to most of us . But to Shakespeare , it is a line of love , and it is a line that I think of often , because it is such a wonderful play ."|0
"OK....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted info on the front. I am a programmer from a North American fest, and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away Moscow/Karlovy Vary interface.Straight away I thought ""this film is not for us"" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. Well, well, well."|1
(Possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away. )I just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic.|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before?|1
Ham-handed homage to honest hacking . Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography , until it came up to the surface , and started to show its teeth . Maybe because it got a lot more explicit , and then a lot heavier . Then it got more explicit still , and so did its heart , and that really scared the hell out of me . Then when it got really explicit , and started to show it's face , I felt the pain of the death of an innocence , because you can tell that it had been dead for too long .|0
Okay , so I love silly movies . If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies , over the top movies , and comedy movies you are in for a treat. So here is a list of a few great silly sci-fi movies that are not only funny but thought provoking as well. This is a list of some of my top 10 favorites and most memorable silly movies. Let me know if you guys have some of your favorites as well or any you would like to share . These movies make me think about what is important in life and what really matters in life.|0
Overall, a well done movie. There were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at, but I came away with something more than I gone in with.I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana, is way beyond what this movie stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India. The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family.|1
"this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection -- - hilarity , truth , fun and above all humanity -- it's a love story of two women that are in the process of changing the world and have come to their own personal understanding of their true feelings for one another . This film is a work of fiction based on their true life . This film is an amalgam of two stories :
One is the story of two young women who come from two different backgrounds and come from two completely different cultures ."|0
"this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they can only see 3-4 feet of space. It's like they were filming underwater and they didn't have enough actors. It's ridiculous

One thing is for sure, they are not going to be able to produce a sequel for this movie. You know what happens to good movies when people start comparing them to bad movies? Movies become bad and bad movies become movies that nobody goes to anymore. You know what happens when people make a movie that makes them feel like crap?"|0
This is the worst of the toxie series by far . The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can feel like you're watching a play or movie . It starts out promising and goes down hill . There are times you want to take your own life , times where it feels like your watching yourself in your sleep . The plot is good and the characters are well cast . The story is better than the other books in this series and I'm looking forward to watching the sequels . It's definitely a different approach to the series from all the others in this series .|0
"Its gon na be hard to make this fill 10 lines .... But ill give it a try ( just for shits and giggles )

Lets get some action going guys ... Lets make some moves and do some shit. So first off lets start off with what you can get with the $500 you get for buying a game, its only 10 bucks and we get the base game aswell. Now i know a lot of guys who play these games who would be happy to sell them for more then $500. So lets just go ahead and list out what i have that i can do with those 10 bucks."|0
"We are in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called ""The Man"". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness."|1
One of the movies i just DID N'T want to see . I got it in the sneak-preview , but thought I would wait til i got the dvd release to see it . What a let down . I thought this movie would be great , it would have been perfect with it being in a time period in the 1960's ,but instead this movie has been trashed by all the critics . To all who did see , thank you for watching , because it will help you see a movie or movie that was perfect and amazing .|0

Their first encounter leads to a romantic liaison , that quickly turns into a violent sexual altercation . The second encounter results in a fist fight . The two women end up imprisoned at the prison , in separate cells . They have only one thing in common . Black Mama White Mama is set in a prison for women in the United Kingdom , where two women are housed in separate cells . Each of the women have one thing that links them , and that's a common enemy .|0
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but think something was very strange but then when i went to see the actual film the scene i mentioned was actually very much like the scenes in the film the film started with them having a good time and then a very long fight scene and then it cuts to the end and then i just thought it was odd they would have so many fights scenes if it was like that in the film at all. I agree. I've read the same things.|0
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best one), I was looking forward to see this film. I didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv I'm terribly happy I resisted buying it on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in Dutch film history. All the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. All humour has been cut out.|1
This movie is funny if you 're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me ( repeating every line) who was actually a woman who sat in a man's seat! I loved the movie and would highly recommend it. Now, I know that I said this is one of the movies that we don't really need to worry about spoilers but I will say this: if you want to know what happens, you need to go and see this movie because the rest of this movie is spoiler filled.|0
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier . Even for a poverty-ridden town of the Dust Bowl era, it's not hard to tell how little there was to warrant the presence of a charismatic Hollywood star. What you'll find when you head to The Lawless Frontier are dozens of old Westerns, but this isn't the kind of Western where cowboys ride into town on horseback, or shoot people in the town square. There are no cowboys in town. No horses in town.|0
As we are well aware , movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history , but they should at least have some relation to it . Movies are also a reflection of the society around them, which are not always very clear about what was actually happening in the last century or even 100 years earlier , especially if they are not a part of the public eye . But even if all of the facts are lost , movies can still give an impression of the past . And that impression has a very direct and real influence on the way we remember it .|0
"One of the reviewers here wrote: ""Good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. Even better ending. "" All I can say is, ""Ugh."" This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian- considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So, what I am about to say is not biased by the""Christian content"" of the film. I'm not gonna bash it because it's Christian. I am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie."|1
"`` Driving Lessons '' sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on , when Grint 's character comes to stay at the family mansion, only to be horrified when he discovers there's more going on at home than meets the eye.

'' A Walk to Remember is the story of the extraordinary relationship between the Duke of Clarence and Queen Elizabeth I, and is a moving testament to the importance of faith in the lives of two people who loved each other so deeply. ''' A Walk to Remember 's author, Andrew Motion, was also the subject of a recent BBC Radio 4 programme."|0
There is no reason to watch this film.Why ? Many reasons . First up , the acting is awful . I really cannot say this is bad or great acting but it is a lot to ask for . It would have been better if the actors were playing their own parts and did not take over the roles that the director and the writers assigned to them . They have to make the decisions and it is their duty to make it look believable . They also have to understand that you are watching a film with no stars and that if you have stars the audience may not believe the film is going to happen .|0
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. First the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street!! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than that of Memphis.|1
"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story."|1
"Everyone has their choice for ""worst movie they've ever seen."" Some like to pick on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some pick on classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14 I have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel the exact same way. It's not ""one of the worst,"" it's not just an expression. It is THE ACTUAL worst movie I have ever seen.How much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie?"|1
Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre- '' Malcolm in the Middle '' Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Jane, a detective who is on a case with a very strong moral and ethical code. But, as is his wont, he fails to live up to that standard. This is not only an interesting story about a flawed human being, but an interesting show as well. Cranston has been around for long enough now that he should probably be in his 50's (or 60's, if he wants to be), which is about where he's been the last decade or so.|0
"I cannot stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so ""distressed"". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? You should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo.I take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they yelling so much? Why is everyone so mean?"|1
Sorry , after watching the credits , I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF. I had a lot more expectations of the show before seeing it , but I think it’s actually a very good series. It started well , and has some great stuff in it . And to think , after watching it , I almost feel that there are still more stories left to come from the universe of SF. I hope it will get more love from people that haven’t watched it yet . And I really hope that the show will not end , but will be continued .|0
THANK GOD YOU 'RE HERE is painful , positively painful . The title is apt , in a sense , as it has to do with what is said to the audience in the show , as opposed to what is on the record with the cast . There's no easy way around it , as this is just the sort of thing I would like to hear . If it were for the audience only , I would say I love it . But this is the public , this is for the critics , as well . This is one of my favorite episodes in the series .|0
Incredibly , `` Vampire Assassin '' is significantly worse than such atrocities as `` Tequila Body Shots '' and `` Vampires Don't Eat Lunch ''. This is true whether it comes to the very first episode, or to any episode after it. Even with the first episode, the story is at best one dimensional and at worst two-dimensional . The story has virtually no characterization , which is surprising, considering that it was created by one of the most acclaimed and most beloved writers in recent years , Joss Whedon. But this is not surprising, as the plot is essentially one big plot device.|0
"Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as ""The Fox"" in ""Whistling in the Dark,"" also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Grey and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka ""The Fox"" finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is going to be living off of the interest."|1
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting.|1
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary.|1
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal which I have visited. It is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.A film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. Well, a wait is a wait.|1
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city . A low rent affair with no name and nothing to draw you in to it other than the premise and the idea that you can get a good steak for a good price and get to see the sun set in the west. That may or may not sound like a great deal of fun. For most people, that's not really a reason to come out. But for people who are attracted to a place like that and like to stay there, that is definitely a compelling reason.|0
"Who does n't love the muppets ? ! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm and fuzzies about life, even if you have only just started. There's nothing better in the world than to sit down to watch ""Muppet Babies"" and have your mind transported back to the good old days when life was simpler, more innocent and more...well, you know. Nowadays, everything seems too complicated, but if you look back to when things were easier, then you'll never know anything else."|0
A scientist ( George Zucco ) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis , but the project falls apart when they discover they are inbred and genetically identical. The scientist ( Michael Biehn ), who is the only one who is aware of the true nature of the project, leaves town, taking a young man along. The two are then picked up by a military man who says he is a Nazi agent , and on their way to Munich where they will fight the Nazis . They eventually get lost in a snowstorm on the road and have to travel by sled dog team.|0
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare 's classic plays , this version of Hamlet does nothing to upstage that great work of art. If anything, I'd prefer it to be directed by Sam Mendes and written by Andrew Davies. For some reason I have a weird relationship with this particular play, I have seen it in the last few years and it always makes me smile. For the first time ever it has a happy ending so it makes me happy too. For that reason I would love this to be done by Ben Wheatley or Sam Mendes.|0
"Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made ""Bamako,"" but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.The nominal ""plot"" involves a young African singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. But far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as ""a mock trial against key financial institutions"" dealing ""with the overwhelming economic hardships of Africa."""|1
You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting , but it 's far from that. Instead, it's like The Flash or Arrow on steroids. Instead of a super hero, they 're all super teens who are outcasts and in search of a place to belong, or to be part of something. It's a pretty good show but the problem is that you need to know what to look for to really enjoy the show. While it has the usual super heroes, it 's all about the teenagers in search of their own destiny.|0
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids.|1
"When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought ""god, this is horrible!"" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs."|1
Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life.|1
"Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as you’ve imagined? I think so, but not as bad as everyone’s imagined it, so I’m going to keep this one short because I don’t think anyone’s gonna be able to keep up with me. But you can watch below to find out! You’ve made it to episode four of season two! And what better way to finish out the new season than to look at the show’s first big reveal…

And here we are."|0
"I 'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview ( yes , SOS ... ) on occasion. So what's holding him back? ( If anyone can shed light on the issue I will be most grateful.) There are a few factors I can see:
1. Safety. I understand that there is a chance of death, either in a collision or an explosion, on board ship, and in a submarine, but I can think of many reasons why submariners are unwilling to put their loved ones on a plane to be murdered by terrorists in a foreign land."|0
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie . It appeared it might be serious drama , dealing with an unusual group of people who seemed to have a great interest in each other . I also thought it had a good message , and it looked interesting . Then I saw it , and it was not like any movie I'd seen before . It had an interesting story with good ideas but not enough of it . The acting was ok . I'll give it that . But it's not like a movie , you don't feel like anything you are doing is very real .|0
"I logged on here right after watching this movie , feeling that it was so awful that at least its plot made more sense to me. I couldnt stop thinking about what the movie had to say. All of my friends that I've known who've seen this movie at least once have thought to themselves at some point or another. They say the same exact thing I did ""What the Hell was that?"" Anyway, my friends have no idea why this movie scared them. I've been trying to think of an explanation for that all day long."|0
"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its ""Sita"" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men."|1
I have seen this movie three times. Going back to VCR's, in the 1980's, and again on The Encor channel last night (Feb.11, 2010). Based on a true story which I remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, I've decided that I find it too disturbing to watch ever again. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. The creepiest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves little brother. (The story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the Internet -- just Google it.|1
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released . All these years later at the time I didn’t know what to make of the movie at all. I thought it was cheesy and childish. Even at the age of 11, I didn’t see this film as anything special in terms of special effects. However now that I’ve seen it, there is no doubt that it is an incredibly special film. There are very few movies that have affected me in this way. In many respects, the movie is a throwback.|0
This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves.|1
Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience.|1
I really do n't know much about the Marquis de Sade , not having read any of his book , but have read a few books by him . He is known for writing erotic novels , which he did from the time he came to Paris in 1866 , until 1885 , when he was caught and tried and eventually executed for homosexuality. He wrote many novels , mostly about homosexuality , and wrote them while he was in exile in France, in France , until he was executed in 1895. I don't read all his novels , but I read several of them , which are rather boring .|0
Oh what the heck, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!Yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks!If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does.|1
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. Then again, are these really suicides? It seems as though there's a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that, making for a very weird looking specter. Recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit.|1
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.|1
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years . It struck home . For those of us who tried to escape from it, it was the only escape we ever had. What it has become in my mind is a symbol of what has been done to the women of India with regard to our body image. We look at pictures in magazines and advertisements in newspapers and wonder what women look like in real life . They seem so beautiful . One day in the mid-seventies a friend called to tell me something that I knew was true.|0
"Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the ""hey, I've got an idea, let's make a sequel"" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said ""hit and run""!"|1
I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake . The DVD version titled `` The One-Armed Bandit ''' is far superior, but I'm glad that the book is available for a much lower price. It's not nearly as funny or as funny-tastic as it is on screen. The one-armed bandits are an odd breed of men, they have one arm as well as a heart and mind. These men don't let any woman come between them and the bandit lifestyle. They live in the hills in the back country of Mexico and rob their way to a good living.|0
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime. Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other).|1
This movie was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera movies. It is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods, where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years. In those time that passed, the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue, which is where a demon god sleeps; they want the god to help them.|1
I ca n't explain it , but I find this movie not only funny , but so enjoyable I feel sad that I didn't think it was so good when I saw the film in theatres . It really is a comedy , a very good comedy , in the end , as the film goes on , you start to wonder what is really happening . I agree with the other reviews , that this film is full of great comic moments , the movie is just so funny , and so good . I saw this film with my parents and my dad said that the movie is a great comedy .|0
OK , so this is horror ? I get horror - but I do n't get horrific . Black & white is pretty easy , it's all in your eye . But I don't get horror . That's my problem ! You may have to get up a little earlier in the morning if your going to get up for work and then have an evening and morning nap at that point in time. I do think we need to expand on what it is you are asking. If you mean horror, you are correct. Black & white is pretty easy, but you get horror in color .|0
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, the movie, which was made in 2014, became the first in the history of the industry to have a rating of 'A-'. The film won five major film awards including Best Movie at the Golden Globe Award and Best Film at the International Cinefanatici Oscar. The film, which is a fantasy adventure film, was produced and directed by Niki Caro. The director of this movie is Niki Caro who had already worked on other high-budget films.|0
Buyer beware . The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description . The movie was shot in color with a hand held camera by the director, and is in black and white. The result is a look that is at times eerie and mysterious. The use of color creates a unique look, and is a very effective way of presenting the images. The music is also a big part of what is great about this movie. This is a film by the masters of the cinematic art, and I urge all buyers to watch it before it is taken from the shelves.|0
Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I was misled after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. Even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time on this one. This movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera.|1
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous . The scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting is not good and the dialogues are so cliche that you find them offensive. This movie did not have a single redeeming quality and in fact it ruined the movie just because of the script and the direction it was given. And it deserves a 2/5 stars in my rating . I really do not understand how some of you like this movie . It does not deserve to be a good movie and in fact if it were a 3 star movie its rating would have been higher .|0
"MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood. No major stars show up--we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). The movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. The only things that save this from being a total disaster are Laurel & Hardy's ""battle"" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful color Disney cartoon called ""The Hot Chocolate Soldier"". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost."|1
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in ""Beware, My Lovely,"" a 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on a Broadway play called ""The Man,"" Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home. She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on."|1
"My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. After starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. Now, he stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies."|1
I do n't know where to begin . Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. And even though there is so much going wrong, I didn't want to give up watching it because so many things were going so right. I was really hoping there would be more to this movie and it turns out I was wrong. Not that it was a complete dud, I just thought it had a few interesting story elements but in terms of story telling it was just a total mess. 1.|0
The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets.|1
I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot!|1
Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. In an attempt to be “funny,” she decides to play a woman whose husband is going through something horrible, so she dresses up like she’s suffering from cancer and comes back to their house to hide out for a week in order to “recover.” Then she realizes she has no idea where she is, so she wanders around looking at everything and deciding what she needs to do to get back to her husband.|0
"Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen 's works has been portrayed . Perhaps if I could meet her herself, I would love her. Wednesday, June 17, 2012

It's been a while since I last posted and I don't even remember what it was about. Maybe I should just delete this one. For the past couple of weeks, I've been spending my nights and early mornings on the computer, writing, editing, re-writing, revising, and editing again as well as doing some research."|0
I have always loved bad creations , rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college . he taught me that bad movies are a part of cinema history . now i realize why that is the case . i am going to spoil it for you by not giving you a bad movie , but it is not the kind of film that i like to see a lot . i will give it a two thumbs-down . if you enjoyed it as much as the critic loved it , you will get a good laugh out of it .|0
'Helen of Troy ' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War . This is more a historical novel and less a romance than some other novels of Helen's life. The historical events are shown in a sequence of battles and speeches that are clearly told from the author's point of view. However the romance aspect is clearly shown when Helen falls madly in love with Paris because of the love which she feels for her brother Paris, who is the cause of all of her troubles as it were.|0
In Michele Soavi's confusing art-house zombie film, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long. Aided by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade.However, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred, Francesco finds himself busier than ever beforeHaving garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officianados, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.|1
I loved this movie ! Yes , it is rather cheap and I 'm sure plenty of reviews will be written on this. But I have to admit that it had me glued to the screen , I can 't describe my feelings at that time. I felt like a child at Christmas. My love for Bollywood films is deep and true. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag was released in 1968. It was directed by Yash Chopra and starred Shahrukh Khan, Waheeda Rehman, Rekha in lead roles as a bride, a friend of bride, a mother and sister, a sister of bride and a grandmother.|0
"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end."|1
Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation Robicheaux is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers? ?, What a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected. it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time. Another FLOP, i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1:42m of wast-full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence.|1
"This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic film shot-by-shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. In 1998, ""Good Will Hunting"" director Gus Van Sant tried it by remaking Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho"" and failed miserably. What on earth was Van Sant thinking of? This remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. The few changes that were made here were no help. If you want to see ""Psycho"", the choice is obvious. See the original."|1
this is an alright show to watch , its not the best nor the worst . I 've watched it about 4 times and the only episode that i didn't enjoy was the second one with the guy that was trying to kill his dad . I will say that i enjoyed watching this because you know that you are watching it in the comfort of your own home , and , like i said earlier , its a good show to watch . I will also say that i have watched it a bunch more , and this is still the only show that I have disliked .|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment . I watched this not expecting too much from an anime. And the first half didn't leave much to be desired. But then it just got real. There is so much stuff going on in this episode, that I had forgotten what it was like to not see it in anime for a long time. Also, the character development is very well done for the first half, and then the story just kind of falls apart for the last half. The ending was not very satisfying.|0
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours . The only thing that saves this film is the music , but that's not saying much . I have a few of these, and I don't think there's a person in the world who wants to sit through it . There's so little of any real value that you would just prefer to be distracted or have sex with someone of the opposite sex. I know there are people out there that have the same mentality but I'm a realist .|0
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: I'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is the ""other"" lead guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band."|1
I ca n't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10 ? It really is great , very funny and a great movie , you will like this . I have never seen this movie but I thought I had, I was wrong . The movie was very funny and I was laughing my butt off , I can't stop laughing , this is a great comedy , you need to check this movie , you will laugh your ass off too . This movie is very funny . It made me laugh my ass off and it has a good story line and I was laughing the whole time .|0
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and I think the script intended disastrous results.Lets start with the one thing I really did not like about this movie.... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this B movie.The best thing was John Rhys-Davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.|1
This forth film in the `` Angel Guts '' saga , which at only a few minutes above an hour, has been made to look like the beginning of a real film that might have taken on the form of a major Hollywood epic. There have always been people in films who talk about being a part of the film-making process, but they never really come out and say what it is. They are actors who are hired to make up a scene in the script. In the scene, their character talks a bit and says something. A camera operator shoots the scene.|0
I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film , since it is padded to hell and back . there really aren't that many jokes in it , there is nothing there that has to be laugh at . so why do we need to put it in the titles ? i guess that is the reason . i hope you enjoyed this film . it isn't the best ever film . it doesn't have anything special . but the fact is that it does have more than a dozen jokes . . so it is an all right film to waste your time .|0
This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Alice, a small town Massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami. After her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happen to be traveling to Florida..|1
"I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me , and we both had the same feeling, we were both thinking, ""This is going to be awesome!"" I don't think it was anything we didn't see coming, even though we were surprised. I really wish I could say more on this one, it's one of my absolute favorites. I've read a few of the other reviews, and they are all positive, so I think I'll end this with some positive words from a fellow marathoner:

""If the film had a theme, it might be running."|0
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness . The water is crystal clear , nor cold . A giant robotic arm has just reached down into the water and dragged up a dead body . The body is a man , in his early 50’s , with dark brown hair and brown eyes . The first thing that the man sees is something that he is sure is his own reflection , because he has just awoken from a deep sleep . He looks down and sees his right hand resting on the side of his face .|0
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. I mention him only because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks JUST LIKE HIM playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate.|1
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's celibate lesbian manager.|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr.|1
"Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i 've even seen . Obviously this is n't intentional though . It actually does make it easier for me to enjoy . The way they make me think . Haha

I was going to write a comment after the previous one but this one is far more detailed than what i expected. This is one of the most fun films I've seen all year so far and it has some of the most funny scenes i have even seen this year. I love it! And you guys are right, the way it's made makes me think, that's the main reason for that."|0
"This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. I did actually read Gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. That angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. Above all this movie just leaves me asking ""WHY?"" Why do we see, as someone else aptly put, ""The Real World: Tudor England""?"|1
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. Unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan!|1
There are actually some good reasons , why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching horror movies. Here are a few: 1. You get an emotional attachment to characters and situations in such films. 2. When you know the characters in such films, the situations in which they have to deal with seem more plausible. For example, if you’re familiar with the character ‘Mr. Perfect,’ you can understand why he will not allow himself to say no to the girl. The same is true for you.|0
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand.From the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre, a shark powers towards us, predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey. It is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes.Our ears on the other hand, are not given the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet.|1
Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here . I thought he would never stop. He was going to do it again, I knew it. So I did it too, once, twice at least. It’s time to see if I can do it again. As soon as he gets in the shower, I pull on my PJ’s, brush my teeth, and go out into the living room to get dressed. I make a quick stop at the kitchen for a drink, and get into my car.|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie , because the trailer made it look so cool . But the fact that it was the weakest movie of the week made it even worse . It was so boring , and the characters never got to grow and evolve , unlike in the trailer . This movie didn't even give a hoot of the fact that the main female lead , played by Zoey Deutch , gave birth to a new life during her pregnancy . Even more annoying was the fact that the plot was completely predictable from the start , which only made things even worse .|0
Yes sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, I really enjoyed it.|1
"Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a ""crypto-zoologist"" (fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: nonexistent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to trap a Chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Grecian cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to. I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either."|1
I can see what this film was intending to do . Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal . The movie is very well made, the characters all are very likeable. The acting is decent , but it could be better , the cinematography , editing , and music are also well done . But what makes this film worth watching is the plot and the ending , which just doesn't quite happen in the story . This movie has so much potential , there is so much more that could be told and the characters could have done a lot of things .|0
The positives : It 's shot pretty well . Has some interesting peripheral characters . Likable main character ( albeit not as likable as we might be used to) . It 's also got some very memorable lines in it . The supporting cast also does well to hold it's own . And then there are also the minor quibbles. It 's still an enjoyable movie with enough good stuff for any fan base to be satisfied . But in the end this is still an uninteresting film . I think this is the only movie i have seen by this director that I didn't like .|0
"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE."|1
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA . No guesswork here . A giant CGI monster vs. an army of robots in an attempt at a one on one fight. I think he was actually hoping they’d take a page right out of the Marvel Universe and combine the powers of Wolverine vs. the Avengers. That would have been funny as hell. Komodo and The Cobras were originally designed as a two on one battle but the designers felt it would be too difficult to animate the monster’s actions. It turns out they’d been designing it as an on-screen character for years.|0
I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it . It’s funny because it has everything I need to get the job done with but it still manages to keep me on my toes with every little change and twist. I have to say I love this move the more I look at it the more I think it is the best. I think I have to keep doing it over and over until I know I can’t improve on what I have already done and I know I will still love it.|0
"This film is all right, fairly silly and to be taken lightly. But what I can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment near the end: ""look, they all look the same"". Isn't that by far passing the good taste standards? I thought it was revolting, as were the heroic, unselfish acts by some of the people in this film. I'm not saying it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn."|1
"Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion . The story has been adapted for the big screen by legendary Filipino director Joko Anwar (Toho Studios) and it tells of a young woman struggling in the dark to find her identity and find her place in a new society under Japanese rule. JEALOUSY & LONELINESS

The film is a story about a young woman who comes to the aid of an elderly woman who lives alone on an isolated stretch of New England beach after her car is stolen by someone looking to use it to run away from home."|0
****Contains Spoilers****As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character.|1
"While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM , I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this film will not end up on this website. After watching, I was able to put this movie behind me. After all, that was a terrible experience. The following is a description of the movie:

A young man goes to his mother’s grave and finds a box. Inside the box was the remains of the man’s mother. The film is about his search to discover what his mother was really trying to do."|0
As I looked at this movie once again , I think it belongs among Hitchcock 's greatest films . The story is very simple , you are the director of a mental hospital . The patients come to you to kill each other , but you refuse to cooperate . Every night the patients kill one another in the basement . After a while , you get sick of it and you hire a man to do your job . You know that once he gets a patient , they will kill him all the time . After some time , you hire a new man to help you out , he is just like any other man .|0
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site.|1
"... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging."|1
I feel terribly sorry ! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting , marvelous , full of spirit and elegance , this is dull and heavy , clumsy , dull and uninteresting . There's nothing in it to please the eye, nothing to move or excite the heart. There is not even anything to attract the attention, which should be one of the principal parts of the work. In fact , the book is rather a failure on account of its want of interest. In spite of all this , it has been well translated into several languages, and we hope that the English publisher will give the book its due .|0
"In my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever. People started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People went nutty, demons were possessing people, all kinds of fun. Of course then it all went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the ""third testament"" in five days, but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy."|1
"I caught this on HBO under its category of ""Guilty Pleasures"", and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. One, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn ""who did it"", you think, ""So what?"". However, I must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson get completely naked a number of times."|1
`` Admissions '' is a fine drama even though they 're are some problems with the ending . Lauren Ambrose , '' the main character '' plays an average high school senior who 's dating a high school boy '' ( and a member of a gang ) . He gets into a huge fight with another boy at school for no reason '' ( and is now dating someone else ) . He then ends up dating the girl he started dating '' a few weeks earlier . The main plot of the movie is Lauren 's search for love in her senior year.|0
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard about this movie before. Simply, I lost track of Seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. Here, again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. The plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. I simply don't have any idea why Seagal did this movie.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor who is now turning his hand to directing movies, one of the most sought-after jobs on Hollywood’s big screen and one that has given him a steady stream of work for several years. I caught up with Howell today to hear all about the ups and downs of directing, why he didn’t stay in the business and what the future of directing movies is for the talented actor and filmmaker. The following interview was originally published in 2011.|0
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . I would think you could get that from just walking into the theater. There was nothing to enjoy about this. The film is poorly made from the first frame to the end of it. For an hour-and-a-half, the viewer is on the hook to make a choice, but they never get the chance to see the choice they have already made. The only reason this film was interesting at all was because it was a re-make of an old movie. In that, the audience would have gotten something interesting.|0
"Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let 's face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and they don't really matter if they were not nominated . The following five movies were originally released in the 1970's and are available in many of the same formats . And , they were all nominated in some fashion for the Academy Award for best Picture . But , who cares ! These are the movies that are nominated and the movies that are not . The Man from Planet A

The Man from Planet A was originally released in 1970 in the United States ."|0

When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild , get ready . You 're in for dark , harrowing films , ones that leave you breathless with a sense of awe and dread . He makes them and you want to see them again , more often than not , because they take you to the brink of madness . But don 't take this as a sign of how much he 's been working on his acting chops , or how good he is at it . Rather , you 're left with the feeling he has an incredible imagination .|0
"Ken Burns ' `` Baseball '' is a decent documentary ... it presents a clear origin of the game , and shows it as it was before baseball became the business we know today and how some people tried to take it out of the hands of the individual players and gave it over to a league that had no intention of having a good time."" --The New York Times on the film

''I think baseball has had its day, but I think it's important to remind people of the fact that this game has been going on for thousands of years."|0
This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder , `` Where is Ralph Macchio going?'' This was a very emotional film to me. The last thing I wanted to see on my birthday is this! I had to get out of there right away so I turned my back to the camera and was in my car before the film was over. I am glad to say the DVD has a better picture this time. I am sure the picture quality improved also. I have no complaints about this movie. In fact, I actually like it very much.|0
Ah the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often I think, do you ever show good movies? OK you have given me the great 'Heroes' and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. I checked out the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact I am half thinking that this is a pseudo name).|1
This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.|1
ExCUSE me, but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o' poop. As the evil sister with hair that Mommy Dearest would envy, I did my very best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. I'm sad that this did not come across... Ah well, a friend compared it to a 'rock bottom budget SHOWGIRLS' with a white hot spoon.' I'll have to be content with that. What amazes me is no one mentioned the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt contest. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history.|1
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.If you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one.|1
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there . Very disappointing to see this movie being cut down from its original length which was 15 hours to only 13 hours. As for me, I am glad that they cut it down as I don't like to see movies being cut down as this is the essence of movies to keep its essence and keep its quality. In the end it's about the content not about the length and this movie didn't have what I expect in the end and I am not satisfied by the end.|0
Throughout watching `` End of Days '' , I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to do a disservice to those viewers who could actually understand the Bible and the historical events it describes. There were some who were better equipped to do that, and who were, in fact, much more literate than me. And there were those who were not. This is why the film could never make sense to me, despite the fact that it had been made to the highest of art standards. This is why you will never see it.|0
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber . The film was not a great critical and box-office success. The book was adapted from a story written by John Updike in 1945. It became a huge hit when the film was made in 1948, when Updike was 46 years of age, but the book is a work of genius, a work of literature, and deserves to be read and appreciated. It is one of his finest books. The film was made by Howard Hughes in 1951, and based on the screenplay written by Henry Koster.|0
This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway.|1
"""Solomon and Sheba"" was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when I was a kid: a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that back then ""Solomon and Sheba"" didn't impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I had enjoyed a lot ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Helen of Troy"" and others."|1
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play . The story is full of holes and a lot of the dialogue is so badly acted that it makes me sick to think about it. This movie was so bad, I almost didn't watch it at all, but I had seen it before and had to see it for some reason. I actually enjoyed the movie, but it was very bad, so I have to recommend it to all my friends, because all you need to do is watch the movie to get a horrible feeling inside of your stomach.|0
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yashraj's second film (he is a huge fan of rajesh rai which is a sad movie)and he has chosen a director for it that is not even good with his first film. so he has gone out in the cold in his second film he wants to take a step further and this film has failed him badly. i cant understand how he could pick a director to do the film and then go on with it when there is no talent in his second film.|0
Two years after this short , the last `` Our Gang '' short was made . After seeing this , I was surprised how much the cast has changed and how much better they are now . I had seen the film a half dozen times , mostly because it was a very good way to spend the time before going to school , but still I had not gotten into the spirit of the series . The movie is very enjoyable . I can't believe it took so long for someone to make a film , after seeing this , I now can see what it must have been like when it was made .|0
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I 've seen a duff film . I'll go to the site to see if anyone remembers it and if so comment on it, if not I'll say I haven't seen it. I just don't know where to go to find things like that. I've just thought of another thing. I don't want to post this because it may not be of any use to anyone. I also know that I've seen many things on YouTube that I would never see in the cinema.|0
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top.|1
Now, lissen you guys, I LOVED THIS FILM, though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor.|1
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice time out for the whole family this evening. And then this. Oh my goodness, what am I even going to do? Am I supposed to laugh? Am I supposed to go home without anything? What do I say? And why am I having this reaction? I am not making this up. Is that a sign? I don't know what to say, because that is the point. I don't even know what this is.|0
"I was n't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a novel. There's only one problem. This is not the kid in question. It's a teenager who has stolen her own kid's paper. And there's no story here. You may also want to read:

In this story, a young girl steals her own paper. It becomes a novel and the story behind it. In the 1980's, a 16 year-old girl, a high school drop-out from Chicago, stole her own kid's school project."|0
`` Yagyu ichizoku no inbo '' ( let 's just say `` The Shogun 's Samurai '' ) is somewhere that I'd like to see it, but it's just out of reach. I need to know all the ways to get to it, even if it's impossible. We've been asked by a member of our group to design a simple application that shows how to do some basic math on the user's machine. For instance, it might show how to take an expression of two variables, say x and y and simplify it by using the square-root function.|0
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. I have seen the movie before with my family but I think it was Kevin Costner and Demi Moore. At least we don’t have to wait another year for the sequel. If you like romantic comedies this is not your film. The main reason I watched this was to see how this plot line would work in the hands of Ashton and Kevin Costner and to see where this movie might lead them.|0
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy 's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I have to say that her novels have often left me feeling cold and a little cheated... but that was the whole point. I didn't read them for any particular reason other than that was what they felt like. If you're going to write the books you want to, that's fine, but they do need a lot of help from the reader to sell them. (It's not a secret I haven't bought any of her books.)|0
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms ( actually only about 20 or 30 or more per year) which deal with nothing but the usual life of middle-aged people or the young people who live in New York in particular. But there are many other kinds of shows on television which tell the stories of the children of America and other nations. These show are called children's television shows. Most of these children's television shows are very successful as they make people laugh so hard that they forget their bad jokes and get back to watching the show.|0

"Yes, I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!"|1
Wow , I was told this would be a B movie worth watching . I feel that I was misled by the hype. This is not an accurate depiction of the story and the acting and plot does not hold up. I'm not sure I really care to see it now. I would not have watched it as a kid if I'd known what it would become. I could not even stomach it as a grown adult because of it's plot. The story is so far from reality and the acting so poor that I'm amazed that anyone bothered to write this script .|0
Watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau.|1
"This is a semi fictional memoir of an ""international man"" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.I was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However, I was disappointed by this film. ""Chico"" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained."|1
George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was , he made them all appear that way . This is why , I like this film so much , its a true classic . From the moment it was first announced , I thought it was gonna be just another horror movie , and like so many films before it , this film has not disappointed , its a very simple story , but at the same time very scary . With all the recent movies being produced , its so sad that one film is getting lost on us , but this one really is great .|0
If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields, and Chaplin. I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women?|1
It's not fair. I was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, After seeing Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes.|1
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z.|1
Normally, I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like?|1
"This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom. Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI. She is the ""daughter of the regiment"", loved as a little sister. Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper."|1
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself.|1
I kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. It just meandered along to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls ... not really . Embarrassing situations are funny ; first time I've seen anime that's not like any others . So I'm surprised to see that in some anime , you can see a girl in school uniform. I think this is what's offensive, she could be a character but she is not. And in the end it was a girl who said it, not really a guy. I don't have anything like that in my anime and don't want to be offensive to other people .|0
"I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick . The shonky production values and amateur acting didn't help matters. So, it's not quite as good as I remember. Here's the trailer:http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20390526/cannibis-zombie-buddy#video=1 The film is now in cinemas (I saw it on Saturday) and it doesn't look too shonky, but it'll be worth checking out if you haven't. I remember being impressed with the first zombie movie I saw when I was about 7. The original ""Zombi"" scared me straight."|0
If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie ( grumpy ogre , annoying donkey , cute kitty ) you’d have the perfect combination. You’d then have to throw in one of the best love story I have ever seen. Shrek 2 was the ultimate love story. Everyone in the audience was captivated by this story of the most unlikely couple in the movie. I mean the love story was like the rest of the film. You could watch it once and you’d know every word. The two of them went through so many obstacles and adventures in this movie.|0
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film . It will suck you in. You will be able to see everything that you have been missing out of life, because they will have done the exact same thing, in order to be a part of this film, in order to make people to see this film in order to spend the money to see the film. You will be spending your whole life as a zombie, and you will not be aware of how many things you have already been doing to waste your life.|0
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens , and more contemporary writers such as John Milton and Oscar Wilde , and more recently John Steinbeck and Cormac McCarthy . It is also a story that is often associated with the playwright Stephen Sondheim . The Sweeney character is a master manipulator, deceiver, and opportunist in his pursuit of the rich, the beautiful, the famous and the beautiful ( and his wife). The story starts in London, and follows Sweeney as he comes to a crossroad in his life .|0
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. The actors - I think all of them are amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it.Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. The lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: ""I´m the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual."|1
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean , the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) and his right-hand man Pierre Laporte are on a fishing trip. However, things take a turn for the worse when a group of Indian villagers arrive on the island. In order to make a deal with the local community, the factory owner decides to set up his own company and hires the two natives as his factory's employees. With their new factory up and running, the duo soon realize they have an unquenchable need for women.|0
I loved this film, Independent film-making at its best. The cinematography , pacing, rhythm , and acting were perfectly in sync. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. And that is just what they did!|1
Thats what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of getting away with it? In comes Richard Hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. A real BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement.|1
The great thing about Thirst , Chanwook Park 's latest film , is that it 's the anti-Twilight . Some of the best writing in the movie is in its first hour, when it 's set up a new world of vampire culture in South Korea, and when you see the movie , you 'd be hard-pressed to make out what exactly the movie is about. We 're not quite sure how to classify this movie, either. It starts off with a scene of a woman being murdered, but when the story unfolds, it 's clear this isn 't a film about vampires, it's actually about a murder case.|0
"I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of ""Grand Champion"" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her images were used for PR."|1
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.|1
2005 was one of the best year for movies . We had so many wonderful movies , like Batman Begins , Star Wars : The Force Unleashed , The Dark Knight , Iron Man , The Avengers , The Dark Knight Rises . These films are amazing and a part of my life. I don’t want to miss a single film this year! So, I want to choose my top 6 films for the year of 2008 , so let us begin. I know I missed a lot of things this year, but there are a lot of good films this year.|0
It 's about jealousy , it 's about racism , it 's about manipulation , but the underlying message is this : you can 't win , and we will always lose , so what the hell 's the point of living , of doing anything , ever , in this world ? The world was made for our enjoyment , it is here for our exploration , and it is we who make it what it is for our enjoyment , our exploration , and it is we who decide what it means , as well as how it means it, and we who make it worth our while .|0
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp 's life in his role as a teacher at an all boys school in New Orleans. Toward the end of the 1970s Crisp left teaching and set about making films. He never had any plans to retire from the world of television but he knew it was time to stop teaching. He turned to a career in acting and took an acting role on a local drama. He also did some commercials, had a short film, and took on a few minor roles in television.|0
I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations , having just graduated college and moved on to my life in New York City , and was pretty disappointed . i guess the main reason was the fact that they had to sacrifice a major character in this , as there was no way for the writers to give her a compelling reason to stay with the series . even the character who was given a more compelling reason did not stand a chance . but i still enjoyed the pilot , which was a perfect way to begin my day .|0
"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. ""Greg, stop clowning! "", scolds Dr. Brandon."|1
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz . A young mother Selma Lidz ( Andie MacDowell ) is a struggling writer who finds a job in an office, even though she wants to be a writer. She gets along with the new woman in her cubicle, who is her boss's daughter. Selma gets a job in the book store where she meets and falls in love with a young man whose mother is a famous author. The two of them have a child and they move to Paris, where Selma feels more at home.|0
Still have n't read a single Dan Brown book , but I watched all his movies adaptations . I woould have guessed that his novels were written on the same genre. I also read his books when I was a kid . I didn't understand what he was going on about but I just found the books entertaining . I enjoyed them . I also really like how he takes the same plot in different genres and turns it on its head . He was able to make me think about what I had seen . I thought I was watching a true crime film when I was in college but it wasn't.|0
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted to be an “amateur” video, but, after a couple minutes of looking around me, I realized my mistake. What I thought was amateur is very professional looking, and this is the type of casting I want to do. So, I went in and watched the video. I’m impressed. I would have loved to have had this experience with a professional casting, but I’ll be doing this the old fashioned way.|0
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.|1
"Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the ""wasted talents"" expression. I had never EVER seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein,and so on). The ""aging"" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. The use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that I could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly."|1
"I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow, I've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up very much into punk rock, and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. Not every punk song incorporates ""Oi!"" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion."|1
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen, and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death.The story begins with introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie.Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named ""Summerfest"". In this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class."|1
OK, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup.|1
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in. The acting and the story was just terrible. I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses.|1
"By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive ""music"" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big ""surprises"" (which actually tend to be about as ""revelatory"" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience."|1
"this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with ""cat from outer space"" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!"|1
Thank God I did n't buy this movie myself ! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of curiosity, only to be surprised when I read that I had no idea what I was watching. The thing is, I didn't know what the movie was until I read the blurb on wikipedia, and then I found out. So that was cool, because it's not really what I thought I was watching. But the rest of the story makes sense, the characters all seem very real. That being said, I'm not sure if I want to own this movie.|0
I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself , but I was disappointed . This movie was supposed to be about two people getting married but there is not even a little romance between any of them. In the beginning , the hero (Kang Dong Yeol ) comes home from work and find that his wife (Kang Min Hee ) has been killed by him and his son is in a coma. The only thing he could remember was that his wife told him to wait until their son got better and he had left the place at that time.|0
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War . The largest front of the whole war, the war between Germany and its ally Britain, is not only the story of the Germans and British but of all who fought in the Second World War. This epic book is filled with many fascinating tales that will delight and inspire. The first is the tale of a German soldier who, as he was fleeing through France in the late 1930s, witnessed a young British soldier die of a bullet wound.|0
I would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was awesome just the same.I also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one.|1
In America, the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. A few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find Augustine, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of Jonathan's family.|1
Do n't get me wrong . I 've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band , but when it comes to this album I can't quite get over the fact that Band didn't really make any of the music for which I would have loved him. I just don't think the music could have been quite as good as the lyrics. I don't know if I should have expected it to be better than it is, or worse, but I didn't expect it to fall so short.|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age ! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are so close to each other at a time when people are fighting for their lives, yet they are forced to share an apartment with an eccentric woman. It is a story of love, betrayal, murder and friendship. Great movie with great music in this movie that will make you cry. I really enjoyed this movies story. I would recommend this to a friend, and I will be watching it again and again. This movie is great and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.|0
Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places.|1
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp horror movies, a fact he acknowledges on the DVD extras menu, right before mentioning that the movie is rated R.

As is the case with most horror movies of the '00s, though, this one is really no slasher. The main problem is that it's got an un-scary and uninteresting premise. There are two campers staying in a cabin, one of whom is missing. The two teens in the cabin — a boy and a girl — start to investigate."|0
`` Mr. and Mrs. Smith '' is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock 's movie . . . ''' The movie opens in an old house in the country, with a couple seated in an old armchair in the front, reading a book and talking. Suddenly an old woman in a white apron appears and begins to work on them. After a time the woman returns to the chair and resumes talking, as if nothing had happened. Finally the old man turns around and leaves the house. We see him sitting quietly on the steps, smoking a cigarette.|0
Actually, Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is no where on par for CGI, but I would give it the same vote.Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role.|1
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally talented director with a great deal to say. I can’t believe I am saying that after seeing so many mediocre movies in recent weeks. Homefront is the story of a bunch of men who are trying to survive after a devastating event at home. One of the men is a young Marine who is a reluctant leader. We follow him during the chaos of the post-traumatic phase of his life that includes his wife and young son. Homefront is about a lot of things.|0
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young girl. They are all old friends, and each one has something to teach the others, but each one does not want to be the one that finds out that their friend was murdered by the young girl’s lover. The secrets were revealed over the course of several months, as the four men tried to figure out why the girl’s love was so important to her. The story had a lot to say about life, death, and friendship.|0
"When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through ""the motions."" i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it."|1
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , I feel it missed the mark by a country mile and I am not alone in thinking this . There is very little to commend it. I think the plot is very poorly constructed, there are too many plot twists and too many times you get the impression that things are going to come to some kind of conclusion that the film has no desire to do. In short, it is a disaster of a movie and a poor example of the kind of film being made at the time.|0
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. It fails at the first post by not being scary OR funny. It is a dull grey movie that I guess went straight to video. Hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school level script. Zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores.|1
This episode of Charmed changed everything ! The show is about to end it 's third season , and all this has been a long time coming. So, what does it mean for Charmed to wrap up the show? How will we know the end is here? Is there any end? Will we see any more? What will happen when the last episode rolls out? Will the show still be on in a few years? Will Charmed go off the air for good? And, if you're like me, what was the best part about the show?|0
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says ""stay away from this movie"". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the worst movie I've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast-forward button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, ""The Cavern"" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like ""The Cave"" and ""The Descent""."|1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece.|1
I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. Justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. If you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early Americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...I highly recommend this movie. Especially during atime of war and conflict in Iraq...when our American image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out.|1
"I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I wondered to myself, ""Why have I never heard of this movie?"" Then I turned over the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters."|1
Unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers , I was very surprised to see what a positive response I was getting from this book ! It is really a masterpiece ! ! I must add that I would not even call it a “pastiche”, it really is a “book that will be loved and enjoyed by all who reads it. It’s funny, it makes one laugh and it makes you think about how much we can learn from life. It makes one realize how lucky we are.|0
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'.|1
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version , I have to say that this is not a movie I'd want to see again . this is a movie that I hope they don't remake , if you haven't seen it you're missing one of the greatest movies ever . but , since the book is still going strong , it may be time for an updated remake . and with that in mind , I watched the new version , which opens on the date of this movie's release , September 28 , 1983 .|0
"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about `` cold spots '' ( signaling the presence of enemy aircrafts ) and `` radar contacts. ' '

`` I have been through this before. I have flown many, many different aircraft, and this is the first time I have flown one in such a cold spot, with radar contacts, in such a manner that I have been asked to go back to an aircraft which I have already flown in a cold spot,'' he told The New York Times . But this is no ordinary flying, as it turns out."|0
28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history.|1
"To paraphrase Thora Birch: ""I kind of like this movie. It's the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film"".This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD, you could do a lot worse."|1
"Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon,""High Sierra"",'41 along with Robert Ryan,(Howard Wilton),""Golden Gloves"",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection."|1
"`` Lets swap Murders- your wife , my father '' - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony (Kelley Quinn) who is the former boss of the local mobster - Bobby ""The Snake"" Spade (Jason Patric) - a criminal who is currently on the lam. Bruno Anthony who is an ex-cop turned mob boss and is being hunted by his own boss Bobby ""The Snake"" - Spade Murders a drug-dealing criminal. Bruno Anthony (Kelley Quinn) - Bruno Anthony is the former boss of the local mob family - Murders a drug dealer."|0
"The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry ""Rain"" Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time."|1
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now . The acting is excellent as all three of the main leads do a good job . This movie is truly an experience to the entire family . I highly recommend this one to those who like movies that are not cheesy . If you haven't seen it yet it is a great movie all around . It's got great action , adventure , and adventure stories . The music and cinematography are top notch . The acting is great . I don't know if the movie is any good but I am sure it is a good one .|0
Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked ! Now , her book `` Breaking Dawn '' will not be the best selling book of all time . It will be one of the most popular books of all time !!!! You have to be a very smart woman and you have to do some very hard math to understand that Stephanie Meyer is not the only one who will make money off the success of Breaking Dawn . In fact you will find more and more books and movies coming out that will make money on this movie.|0
A total and absolute waste of time . Bad acting . Bad story . Predictable . Simple . Pathetic . Just when you think that the movie couldn’t sink any lower it sinks it’s proverbial head right through the floor . It’s not often that one of the most loved and critically acclaimed films of all-time gets a bad review but when it does it really hits home. “Django Unchained” is a bad movie. A movie with an amazing cast and director(s), it’s a true testament to the power of movies and film in general.|0
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful! !, as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, not a damn thing happens!. All the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!,plus The ending is especially lame!. The only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however he is wasted here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever!, plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over!.|1
What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role.|1
I 'm a Christian , and I have watched pretty of Christian movies , but this one is too bad. It has nothing to offer. I mean , I don't think it was written with any sense of humor in mind , nor it was written to be entertaining . I could not take any entertainment value , because I don't think I would enjoy it . The plot is so dull. Why the author doesn't use his imagination ? . The story is so lame and the characters so dumb and dumb. It is so lame and so lame .|0
"`` Nicodemus '' is almost a copy of `` Red '' in the odd behavior sense , but this episode isn't about him. to:

I was laying in bed , flicking through the channels ... and boy do I have channels ... 500 of them ... to the point I can't see the whole picture. So you know what I was thinking? I was thinking about how much fun I could have with that kind of bandwidth. And then the idea struck me. I've talked about it a couple of times before in the past few months but I thought it would be nice to share it with you. And if you can think of something better, please feel free to tell me.|0
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics , it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable. While it does provide insight into a couple of very interesting areas of life, it fails miserably at being a fair representation of all the issues involved. The most important problem facing a new parent is not that their child will be born to them, but it will be raised in their culture and environment. This is an extremely sensitive subject and can be an issue for both parents and child alike, but for those not from a particular culture it’s even more important.|0
I just can not emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is . Justthe memory of this movie right now makes me want to buy the book and make my own tribute to the film . Just one last thing I have to mention about how the film is filmed and shot . It has been my honor and privilege to watch the actual filming for this movie . It was done on 16mm film . I can tell you that was a labor of love , I am still trying to figure out if that is what I was paid .|0
I have watched two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I am no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful college life. I wish that I spent a little more time socializing. I kind of identify myself with rusty. When I was rushing a fraternity, my big brother was not like Cappie at all, I wish that I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters, then it is a pretty good show.It is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes.|1
I watched this film last night, i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out. The opening scenes were so long winded, the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere. The story line seemed so poor to me, she gave him HIV and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected ( i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people) Then when he dumps the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet, was in the forest and saw him dumping the body.|1
"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good."|1
`` The Man From Utah '' opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback . This is how the film began in the film's opening credits: ''L. Frank Baum, the famous creator of 'The Wizard of Oz', has died, and he has been given a great deal of credit for the story in which his characters live and suffer in a fictional land called Oz. But how much of it really is real?'' As the film progresses, the cowboy, who claims to be a friend of the characters, gets more information and reveals that he is actually an outsider from another land.|0
I would n't recommend this to anyone , except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film , not with the film itself. It's so bad I can hardly read it, but if you don't find that funny , please find someone who does and let them read this. I just can't understand the people who actually find this film to be funny or enjoy it. Its not funny or enjoyable , the film itself is awful , but the people who enjoy it have no idea of the film , its one big joke , that makes the film so funny .|0
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film . On its surface , the movie tells the story of a boy named Peter, who is in love with a girl who lives just up the street . But that's not all the story has to tell. It's also a love story of sorts between a lonely boy and his mysterious neighbor. And while that last part might sound familiar to some, what we get here is an unusual blend of a documentary and a rom com. It's a film about a girl falling for the neighbor boy in a very strange way.|0
"Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. ""Mostly Martha"" or ""Bella Martha"" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, to the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original."|1
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or wounded as themselves, and then their song transforms. This happens to me all of the time. I’m one of those people. And I have a way of knowing what a song is about when I hear or experience it – I feel it. That’s what makes the difference. But it is not just people like me. Many of you have been in my place – at least once.|0
This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.The movie's timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors.|1
"This is one awful movie!! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I sure disagree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew I guess. In addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.As bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons but it's a good ""so bad that it's fun"" flick.By the way, there's no such thing as ""La Castagne""."|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and candid performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm certain it couldn't have attained the Dante-style depths that this one did.|1
A genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, its imaginative and genuinely gripping, but at the end its almost like Oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a rapid ending.The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together. But their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness.|1
"This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a ""10"") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie."|1
The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel , by Arthur Bernède , from 1927 . Not a very scary book , and the original film , in 1932 , is pretty much the same. It is now available on DVD , though the story and the characters of Bernède are rather different from the movie . Bernède wrote one other novel , and made two other films , one of which is now known to be lost . Sci Fi channel had a show on the film in May , which is now available on Hulu and the various streaming services .|0
"David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. ""eXistenZ"" is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game."|1
I 've lost count of the times I have seen this movie , but I love it and find it really well made . this movie is very well acted . it is a family movie , and the whole family , even the mom is great . the family is going on a trip to another country and this is their first trip . the family is going to the city , the dad has a friend . the dad's dad , who is a captain is going on the trip , and the captain's friend is going with them , so the trip is split in 2 .|0
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s . Guy Stone is an actor who makes a living acting on TV and in plays. In an attempt to pay for the bills, he takes on low-paying work, such as driving a truck. One day at the end of a particularly hot day, he is trapped in his truck for hours as it idles outside a warehouse in the middle of the desert. Just when he’s beginning to suspect he’s been trapped for days, the owner comes in to collect the money owed.|0
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's and have always wondered what was so interesting and interesting to me about it. Well, for one it was about a man that had been through a number of trials and tribulations throughout his short life and who now found himself at the end of his road and looking back at some of what he had endured. It seemed like a film about what it is to live one's life as a man. He was not perfect, he had his own flaws and faults.|0
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on the western front. I would highly recommend to any of you who is into these types of stories, you will have a great read. A little bit of history about this film, in case you don’t care about that, and because I want it on this review page, and also because you might like it! The film was a big box office success and earned $40.6 Million at the domestic box office.|0
It 's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a big hit, not just here in Canada but across the English-speaking world where it continues to sell many thousands of tickets per day. What a terrible movie, what a horrible script. The basic plot goes as follows: it's the summer of 1945 in England, World War II is in the past, Britain and the U.S. are both allied with the Soviets, the French government is friendly with the Germans and the Germans hate Britain as much as they hate France.|0
"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film."|1
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. I did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. Am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings.|1
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40 's and 50 's , you were guaranteed great entertainment. She's got a unique gift as a storyteller and it's no secret that she was a pioneer in the medium of the moving picture. Her filmography spans nearly three decades and includes over 75 movies. If you were to compile the list of her all time favorite films you would find that she has chosen a handful of her best works. But there's something more to consider than just what films she chose as her personal favorites.|0
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater . Despite its local provenance ( and its relation to The Philadelphia Story in some way , even though this film is an adaptation), I've always found myself looking back on this as one of my least-favorite films , not least because it has the misfortune of being released a mere twenty years after The Philadelphia Story . It was released in theaters on a Saturday , but it was shown at 6:00 PM in my area, and I had to make an early departure at 7:00 PM to catch the first show of the night .|0
I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. This show had potential to be good. But my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in every episode.|1
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lays as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride.|1
Why do people make bad movies ? Did n't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making was shit ? No. No one could know because they did not want to. And that is why people are pissed off at people for making bad movies and for being people who make movies . People do not go see movies. People go to the movies. People go to the theater. The only thing movies are to people is a way out of boredom and entertainment. People go see the movie. And that is it. Movies do not even have the slightest effect on people.|0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat.|1
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! Here we go....Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think this is a big flow. Forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws.|1
I ca n't say if `` The Cavern '' is a ripoff of `` The Cave '' because I have never read them both and have not seen the movie, so I cannot know for sure if they are connected in any way, but I will say if they are they are very good ripoffs that I am very proud of, I mean just look at the art and the story and the dialogues and everything it has. I'm pretty sure there is a connection here, I'm not sure where it would be.|0
"Everyone knows that late night movies are n't Oscar contenders . Fine . I mean I 'll admit that I 'd seen ""American Hustle"" just a month ago. But now, with ""Argo,"" we 've seen the Oscars. I 'm here to give my thoughts on ""Argo,"" which, as of writing, has won three Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. While I don't agree with every vote, I will try to address some of my issues and hopefully give the film more of a chance."|0
I 'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one . I find the concept of the zombie very fascinating so I wanted to know more and came to this website for more information . I have watched the first two films and now want to see the third one as well . From the trailer it seems like a really fun and engaging film. The characters are interesting and they seem to know what they are doing and it seems there is a lot of action so it should be worth watching . However , the zombie part of it scares me .|0
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart, and I think this is one such work. The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art.|1
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ . I know the house that it is based on because I have seen the news report on it. The movie will focus on a group of teens in Milford, NJ and how they dealt with a rape, and their reactions to it. This is a good movie for teens to see about rape and it is definitely worth it to see it on the big screen. This is also a movie that is very emotional. The movie is about a group of teen girls who have been raped and need help dealing with this.|0
"Though it's a Christmas movie, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby."|1
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman . She gave her rather thankless performance as the lead female character in Black Swan. She did so with ease and with grace and we were impressed by the performance. But the movie’s story is one of a kind. This is not a typical Hollywood movie. There are no romantic scenes in the film and we were also left with no real answers about the character’s motives for acting like a psychopathic maniac. So what was it about Natalie? Well she did have a great performance.|0
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps to himself. He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes.|1
***SPOILERS*** Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold pouring rain.|1
"When I first saw this show i thought to my self "" What is this!!!!!?"" Its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered ""huge"". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and well her family. Shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!)"|1
George Sluizer 's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time . Why was this remake made at all , and how is it that the people making it are still alive ? I am tired of seeing people who were not involved in the actual filming who are now complaining about how pointless it all is . Just because it was done in England doesn't mean it's not pointless . I saw it in London and thought it was pointless . It was not an original film . I saw this film at a time in my life when I was trying to make life better for myself .|0
For the first time in reviewing films , I found myself immediately uninterested in this story . I do n't know why I didn't take interest in this story because I have n't see the movie and I can judge it for myself . It is all about the characters . I have read the reviews before this one but I didn't understand why I should not be interested to read the reviews and then judge the movie . Well , I did . If I didn't want to see a movie this time , I won't see one .|0
A lot of 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents... stuff fell into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing.|1
"There 's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel , which, again and again, gets stuck in an infinite loop of ""why is it here when there's no more?"" It's as if the game's makers have come up with all the answers but never bothered to make people use them in the game itself. If you don't know, or care, then you might think you're reading an actual game review. But the only thing that's actually reviewed is the thing that you're playing."|0
I have recently found this film on one of my husband 's VHS tapes ( the blank variety which he has since long discontinued ). I just recently found this on YouTube and I was surprised to find it is only 2 hours long so I decided to see if anyone here has ever seen it. I am an elementary school teacher and my husband is in the US Air Force so I decided to look at the reviews on Amazon or other similar sites. I found some reviews that are in French so I will have to watch this at my own time.|0
This is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around. It is heartrending, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius.I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the movie adaptation), and I was just enraptured by the characters. I laughed out loud more than once.|1
Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes , hit each other over the head with a stick for not being able to hit a rock and laughed at the stupid things the women did. Then they started to build things . The invention of the plow and the spinning wheel and the wheelbarrow were some of the most important and life changing innovations of our civilization. Yet, as important as they were to our survival as a culture they were also to the extinction of all other life forms on the planet .|0
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion."|1
What a crap that movie is . The script is simply non existent . The movie at times seems like it has been made specifically for the purpose of ruining it. Not only do you get to see a lot of scenes that you didn't see in the previous movie but some of the plot twists are just downright stupid . This movie looks like it could be awesome but it just seems like the actors are just having as much fun as possible and are trying to be funny as opposed to being serious. I just wish it was a little closer to the first film .|0
"While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. A few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: ""I ate a rabbit."" ""I TOLD you she was possessed!"" ""Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?! ""There are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.The story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the Priest)."|1
Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the President-elect's wife, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the First Lady dead. This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President.|1
"Countenance! Antoine Monot, in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, understated old-school bard of ""There's something about Mary"" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. In visual allure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere."|1
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. It doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. The jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. And the leads are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later.|1
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film . I had never heard of it and it turned out to be an animated feature for children . It was a story about a family that had been adopted . There was a big part in it where the family was on a beach and there was a tsunami. And they were about to take the kids and go on a boat trip. And then a tsunami hit. And the waves just went right over it . And they were so scared because they could see right through the waves.|0
The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters?|1
Oh yeah , this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of `` worst 80 's film'' . There are other good movies that could have made this list but they either weren't made or aren't quite as good, or are missing from this list, like, oh, you don't want to know... The movie opens up with a guy and a girl on a boat. The guy gets in and the girl gets out. After about 20 minutes, the girl jumps out of the boat and is seen walking away from the scene.|0
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) FX was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. As is typical with these D movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. Hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really really big step down from Babylon 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' It was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also.|1
I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!|1
I loved this movie . My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart . There are not many things she can’t do at home . We had an outdoor birthday party in our backyard . The kids were out of town . And our party was in the afternoon . So I knew I wanted to make a picnic and get the party going . I thought of using our old outdoor table . It had 4 legs , a bench and it was easy to clean . It also had four sides , so that was pretty convenient . The table was in our backyard .|0
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the ""River's Edge"", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy."|1
Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one of the most powerful and dangerous actors in the business. Raisuli is responsible for a number of murders. The kidnappers will not release the ladies until a large amount of gold are paid to the kidnappers for their safekeeping. Beautiful actress Candace Bergen is in the film playing the title role. Her beauty is apparent in all her performances, whether it is a role as a child bride, a young adult or a young woman.|0
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott(Marshall Thompson)has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott(Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil. On Dan's second flight, he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm.|1
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful! !This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a bad name.Next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. It's like a drunken snail making its way to die.Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's the only thing that kept me watching.|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philip.Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while.|1
I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV . It 's the perfect example of how to be stupid in a way that makes you feel you are smarter then you are. I never read the original novel. All I knew was that this was a movie adaptation. I'm sure you're not the first person to say this but I would think that the main problem with making an adaptation of a beloved novel into a movie is that you're not really taking the story of the novel but just putting it into a film or a television show.|0
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape.|1
This film follows the life of a great guitar player , who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly. The story of a guitar teacher who is willing to do anything for her students . The main character is an extremely gifted guitarist who takes on many of life's challenges. I would describe this film as realistic, because I think it reflects the reality of many young people who want to succeed but fail. I would describe the film's message to children as a very positive one . You can tell that the main character wants to be an adult who makes her life work.|0
There was n't much thought put into the story line on many fronts . This is a good action movie with decent action, good fighting, and good story. The acting is better than I expected but not perfect. It has good chemistry between the actors. I was happy with it and I will see it again. I thought that it had more action than most movies these days, but unfortunately it falls short of my expectations because of that. I don't think it will ever reach the heights of some of these action films because it just didn't have anything to offer.|0
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say awful? The script was so weak, using cliche after cliche. It seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on Enron. Watching the movie, we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book this bad? I don't know what to say. Just terrible.|1
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. A couple exchanging nods over their ""good grub."" A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline)."|1
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary . One reviewer on Four Word Film Review ( www.fwfr.com ) described it as: ""Not worth watching if you do not already know the definition of the title word."" I thought that this is an overstatement but I did watch it anyway. It was a very disappointing movie. It's not so much that it is bad and not worth watching if you already know the meaning of the word it's more like: ""It's bad but you might not know what the word really means, and therefore you might miss out on a good movie."""|0
I 'm an action movie fan but until today I 've never seen a preview or an ad for this one. That's because I only have a VHS player and an 8-track recorder at the moment, and the tape I've got is of the '70s, so this will have to make it to the record store. So I'm looking for suggestions on how to review a movie I like, or at least how to start off. My first thought was to review it as a movie fan, but I'm not familiar with movie reviewing.|0
"As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, ""Gag me out the door."" I would definitely vote this movie on IMDB's Worst movie list.Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure."|1
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal , my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. She was a single mother in a small town. Her job was teaching school. My mom was a very beautiful woman, slim and strong. So, when you think about her being forced to watch something like this, do you see a similarity between Enron and my mother ? Both women were strong, smart, and independent. But the movie didn't give a damn about these women as they had no role in it.|0
"I'm originally from Brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. They told his life story and he never got one ""centavo"" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in Brazil. Sad... but that is the world we live in. It's about making money not saving lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most probably... dead. We tend to want to live in this ""Disney filled fantasy bubbled life""."|1
Reba is a very dumb show . You can predict pretty much anything that 's about to happen . Barbra Streisand is always great at what she does . It's like watching a play where the main character has to act like Barbra Streisand . She can be very funny and clever and sometimes she does some dumb things . It also seems to have a lot in common with a lot of movies and shows . I love that this show is not dumb . I think that it's smart but I don't take that to mean that it's smart in a bad way .|0
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram . What a come down from Fox values and standards ! As a result of this movie we were exposed to some very interesting new actors, who in turn helped bring in some new and exciting faces to the screen. It is such a shame that we have lost this film. There are a few things about it that are worth remembering, which is that it was shot on black and white and in an extremely limited time frame. The lighting, acting and sound were all very poor.|0
"The `` silver screen '' gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life 's rainbows and sunshine. In ""The Golden Years'' a group of young people come together one day in an old house with an intriguing history and discover that they are all aging differently and that they are part of an important experiment about the nature of life. ''The Golden Years'' is one of four feature-length dramas from writer/director Brian Currie that debuted in theaters in 2014 and 2015 at the Cannes Film Festival and at the Venice Film Festival."|0
"In Thailand, the Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins to a clan of ""good"" vampires leaded by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from the claws of Niran.I expected that ""Vampires: The Turning"" were a good movie."|1
"In my analysis of ""Trois couleurs: Blanc"" I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of ""Trois couleurs: Bleu"". I think it's the same with this film. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness."|1
"Even if you 're not a `` theatre person , '' I highly recommend that you see this . Based on true events it is the gripping account of one man's attempt to save his community from one of the worst calamities of its history."" ""A powerful and often moving account of the life and work of the author, who, as the first black mayor of New York and the city's chief administrative officer, is considered one of the 20th century's most progressive public officials."" - Publisher's Weekly

""This is an unforgettable account of a very important moment in the fight for racial justice."|0
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this film is equally good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived.Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. There are no parents; they are on their own surviving. Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself.|1
Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding , confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B. To be honest, I don’t have much faith in Column B‘s story. But this week, it took on an even weightier significance. On Tuesday, we lost a great writer. And, I felt like I lost another friend. As a reader, you know that one of our biggest strengths, if not our primary reason for being, is the people we get to know and care about. They go to our graduations, weddings, and funerals, and they become family.|0
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a cast containing such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. HOWEVER, I am so glad that I did view this film as I now have the memorable saying 'Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by.|1
Boy Oh Boy, does this movie stink. This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. Only watch this thing when it comes on as a MST 3000 Episode. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to watch it without that show, I would've stopped watching it before it was over.|1
I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team, as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well, we do get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable tales of family pains, generation gaps and fatherhood, in particular. But it's drama, thankfully, and what drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story could seriously carry a whole movie, if expanded separately.It's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed.|1
"Somehow, I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert,(Diana Pennington),""Thank You, Good Night"",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain."|1
"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love."|1
I like `` Hack . '' Think the `` Lone Ranger '' reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver , a role that's in vogue at the moment. If you don't take a cab at all, there's a good chance you don't remember the Lone Ranger, or that he ever even existed. In the same vein, I never thought I'd use the term hack, but then it turns out that was a deliberate choice -- it's a word that came up as part of an email message I received while writing a column about the dangers of texting while driving.|0
As a fan of C.J. 's earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?)|1
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while, and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It's never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed.|1
I 've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now . When a writer develops a story idea he likes so much he decides to pursue it by writing a novel of the same title. When it becomes popular enough it is released as a novel in its own right. Most of the time when this occurs it's the writer who writes the novel who then develops the story concept for a second book of the same title. This is a way to take the risk of taking a concept which has been successful once and then making it better and more popular.|0
"So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; this is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now both of us had seen to the first two Scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we notice a picture of Ken Shamrock (""The World's Most Dangerous Man"") on the cover."|1
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons , I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might arise from reading about the show, and I figured it would be a pleasant and relaxing way to spend Sunday evening. I didn’t make it very far, however, because the episode was not quite what I had expected. I didn’t expect the show to end with this, but rather with an ending so abrupt and unexpected that I was not even prepared for it; I thought the episode would have at least hinted at a resolution, if not an end.|0
I was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! Truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films.I did think this one was a bit too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to Caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference.|1
Most awful casting I 've ever seen . Clark Kent as a crack head , a very feminine looking woman with a terrible accent ( not his voice , but she was using his voice and mannerisms to give herself an edge ) as Superman , with the voice of Burt Reynolds playing Batman. That was pretty terrible as well. I always like Clark Kent as a superman because it makes the movie feel less like a Superman movie, and more like it's a movie where the entire story is being told through Clark Kent's experiences, so he could play Clark Kent.|0
This is a pretty obscure , dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades . It is really stupid and not worth discussing but it's fun to pretend to like something you hate . The movie opens by showing a group of people who have gathered to discuss an island where a creature is attacking people . There is a huge lake with a mysterious hole in it . When they arrive they find an abandoned house with a door on the lake . They all decide that they should go to the house to investigate and that they shouldn't wait for the creature to attack.|0
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ;D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.So as not to spoil anything, I wont go into detail...but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel.|1
I ca n't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic . I 'm a million miles from this situation and have no doubt that what is portrayed is what happened.I would not expect a single parent with a large family of kids to have enough cash to make a down payment on a place like the one described here. I do expect a person who is struggling with money or trying to save money for a home down payment to be able to do so.I would have thought it was more realistic to show a down payment at least on the same level as the rent in a first-timer's situation.|0
"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf""."|1
I love this movie , first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end. Wahlberg is the man in the film . He is my all-time fave and I can watch a movie without him in it any day. He is the reason this movie is worth watching . He and Jennifer Love Hewitt had an incredible chemistry on screen . And when they were apart , it was as though Jennifer was my friend instead of a sex object . Mark Wahlberg is the man. I just loved it all. Mark and Jennifer together, the chemistry between them, and Mark being so funny.|0
When the Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager.|1
"As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails."|1
Firstly , I am a huge fan of crap films . B grade is always good for a laugh . Now let's get to the point . This movie is bad , but that's a bad way to look at it . I think it deserves some respect , because it is actually very funny , and it is a movie that I would see again, without fail, with any film that I saw , in any format . And that's the problem , because I really don't see it as a bad movie. I think it is one of the best comedies I've ever seen .|0
All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, I really do. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. But this was hardly even funny...I mean, I guess it was, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks...terrible. And the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13.|1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself.|1
I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int ' l Film Festival . It is extremely absorbing and informative . It's not a documentary but a short film made by someone who was there and knows the whole story. You will get a feeling of what really happened during the war. If you do like documentaries and like to see good ones , you must see this film. This is a great film to introduce your child to the horrors and horrors of war. It tells the story of an extraordinary man, one who gave his life for his country and another one who was murdered for his cause.|0
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. It's very cool and entertaining.There's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie I've seen.|1
Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India.|1
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line . Navy Commander Chuck Prescott ( Marshall Thompson ) has developed the ultimate super weapon: an atomic reactor, capable of powering an entire city. When a nuclear explosion goes horribly wrong, he finds himself trapped, surrounded, and outnumbered. Luckily, he discovers a mysterious woman who can see him as he is now. As a result, he's given a life sentence, but when the woman he loves becomes a prisoner in his own cell, she can change his mind about what he's capable of and give him hope.|0
I 'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do . I 'm pretty sure it 's true , and it 's pretty interesting , but it is not going to be in here . Anyway , the thing that you need to be aware of it that this story does not end here . It does end here , but it doesn 't because there is a different end . The story continues . In fact, there are multiple endings , but I'm going to keep this short and simple . I think you should go see the movie to know the story , but you should also know it .|0
It 's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead , this has solid characters and chemistry that you will not find in any romcom where the man leads, I would have to say it is my favorite so far in the series and would give it 5 out of 5. I really enjoyed this movie! It has a great romantic scene that is funny, and it's interesting how different the relationships between the characters are, you get to meet them all, which is just so fun.|0
The first thing you should know about `` Zipperface '' is that it was shot on video , so it looks as if it has been cut from a film or something, and you can easily tell it wasn't shot on film because there are no film stocks used in its production. And that is one reason why the special effects in the film look really good, and the other reason is because the director and his team did not need any special effects because he used video footage instead of film to create Zipperface . That said, there is something that I found strange about Zipperface .|0
"The good things first : I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene in this episode, and that I think the scene is a perfect example of Ray Harryhausen's master craft. ""I know exactly what you feel,"" she said softly, taking my hand. We were in a room with high, arched windows. She looked at my face, then at my body and then my hands. ""You like me,"" she said. I didn't answer. I was too embarrassed. ""It's not about what you say."|0
In the mid 1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities.|1
Great acting, great production values, good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For instance, we're very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.This is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books.|1
While not as bad as some movies ( like the horrible `` Atomic Twister '' ) , `` Meltdown '' is pretty terrible. A group of people are trapped inside a giant tank of molten metal. They are unable to leave, no matter how they feel. A man tells them the truth about the situation and the consequences they are facing, but it doesn''t really matter because he tells them to do what they will to escape. They can''t really leave, so they do what they will to survive. There are some good parts and some decent scenes.|0
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen . Here are my thoughts on it . Story :- The story is very basic. A teacher goes to an island with his family. There they learn how the island is, but there is no one on that island. When the teacher arrives on the island the island dies. The teacher leaves the island, the island dies, then the teacher comes back, and the island grows up. Cinematography :- The cinematography was incredible. I think the movie was in black and white.|0
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good ! ! ! Thought it was a pretty cool movie and I think a very good adaptation of the book !! The movie is good, but the script was really bad. And the movie was not at all as good as the book. Although I liked the novel better. I didn't understand the ending, but the movie was very enjoyable. It took me back to my high school days, which are probably the only good moments in my young life. So, I give this movie 1 out of 4 stars.|0
"Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! I was appalled. Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his ""thumbs up"" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.What a pity. Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program."|1
Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial , I had the displeasure of watching this commercial one more time, this time for the Billy Mays Superball, the game in which players toss a coin to determine which of two balls they must hit in order to make a hole through the other side. Now, I know Billy Mays didn't invent the Superball, but he certainly deserves credit for inventing one of the few great American sports of the past fifty years (that's saying a lot) and bringing it to the attention of the whole world with the Super Bowl.|0
This is an astonishingly bad action film. I'd say its primary flaw is that it's BORING. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set design, and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. Mod Squad's second (major) flaw is its lack of character development--underscored by the actors' lack of talent. I tend to like Claire Danes's work so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully miscast: how could his cotton-mouthed, bumbling acting style possibly fit into an ACTION flick?|1
"The title does n't make much sense to me . I 'm not sure what door in the movie should have been named. In any case , the point of this is that the title should not have been made up by whoever wrote the book, or whoever is the film director or producer. That should be clear by now . I think , if I had to give an example , I would choose a movie about the story of Jesus Christ , like in "" Jesus of Nazareth . "" So , this is not the case with your film ."|0
I have only seen this movie once , when I was about 14 years old , but I was thrilled that it was being shown in the cinema . It's a very good movie that I would recommend to all my friends as a birthday gift . I have given it a score of 6.5/10 which means that this movie is very funny , the plot is good , the characters are good and so is most of the dialogue , the actors are great and the movie overall is very entertaining and fun to watch . I really hope that more people go to the movie .|0
First of all I hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their forehead. The rest I have no real problems with. There are just so many bad rap artists now. Rap is no longer a music genre , it now is just a way of trying to gain a popularity. Thats all. I would love to see all of you out there go out and see a new rap artist that can sing. If they can rap or sing , then it is not rap. If it is a good rap or good singing, then it is rap.|0
"Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor actors. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The ""Arab terrorists"" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the ""Arab terrorist""...DAMN!There is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like).The movie is divided into two parts."|1
"Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.Have you ever heard the expression ""as exciting as watching paint dry""? That pretty much sums up Satanik."|1
Not too many people seem to know about this movie . Which is too bad because I think it 's a good movie. It was directed by John Woo who was famous for directing some of the best Korean action films ever. I don’t know if it would have been made in America or not but I would have loved to see it onscreen. And I can say that it would probably have sucked. But I think the story was good and there were just a couple things that were wrong with the film.|0
"I could not believe what i saw ... ( once ) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should have been called ""a comedy"" or ""a farce"" instead. You don't know who wrote the script. You just read the script, and that's all you'll ever know. I'm not sure I've ever read a script where I couldn't find fault with it, but I can't think of any where this was. I would have been more impressed if it had been better written."|0
"This is, arguably, the worst of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous. But that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he's Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (! ), and Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a major popular song, ""Speak Low."""|1
"""Tumbling Doll of Flesh"" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.Typically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.There is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.The special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.Her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."|1
Buyer beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description. The movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. It looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception.|1
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments ( much less hundreds of 'votes ' ) speaks volumes to the low regard many of us in the internet community hold for the show. That said, I am amazed that this episode has not been removed from the net, even though there is only a minute or two of it, as it is one of my favourite episodes. What can I say. There are a few things to take into consideration. For starters, this was an episode that was intended to air in the first season, and not a second or third ( I think ).|0
I must admit I was n't expecting much on this movie . I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as there wasn't much action at all . This movie will appeal to action fans as well to those who like the violence but not too much . I'm not the greatest at writing movie reviews so I will be using my own words and not writing any script . I'm a movie reviewer for a Korean website . I hope to get some positive feedback from my fellow readers in the future as I'm sure this film would get a positive review from those who enjoyed it .|0
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times Jacqueline rubs herself, the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good.|1
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time.|1
Since I 'd bought the DVD , I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of duty . I'm not a fan of the story but I was in the theater. I still don't mind this one. It has its good points but I can't agree with the way it ends . . . which is rather strange considering that the ending may be a good one . It's just strange that it ended like that. In all honesty though the movie was a little disappointing. It didn't offer anything really new to me .|0
"Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge and a few good ideas . I don't think you'll find too many people alive who were as amazed as I was on opening the box of this game and seeing in the box ""Bog Creature Game"" and thinking ""Wow, what a game this is!"" This game was a fun experience and I had a very happy ending that was worth every penny I spent on it. The graphics are great, the game is very challenging and keeps you coming back for the next level or challenge."|0
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time that I saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it any more I busted out laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found.|1
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously.|1
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again.|1
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
This movie is really bad . The hero ca n't play . You see too much that he learned his life in his 20 s , 20 s , but too much is not necessary . What i like about this movie that i think it is great . The heroine is very nice . I like the music of it . Overall it is a good film . But there are not that many scenes in the movie . So there is no sense in the movie . That's the only thing I can say . If you have seen this movie then you will love this movie .|0
I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. I don't get the idea, why that kid died? ?Is a cliché, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.LOL.I don't understand what is the connection with the movie... And is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.Nothing new in this movie.|1
Love the TPB 's but this was a lame episode . Did n't have the same feel that the series had . That is to say the episode had some moments I enjoyed , but the ending was lame . The episode had many moments that I loved , but the episode had so much potential . It could have been a lot of fun . All of the characters have so many stories and backstories that there should have been many different stories for all the characters . So much potential . I thought it was just as funny and entertaining as the series with many funny moments .|0
it 's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams. In our case, we know exactly where the footage was recorded and have the rights to all the footage. It just so happens that in this movie we're going to show, we had to change the camera angles just to stay on budget. We also had to move the camera in and out of the room several times so as to not appear on camera during the scenes, which is not only expensive to do but also a huge safety hazard.|0
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from Getty Images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?)|1
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad , although it is . The odd thing is that it can be so supremely good . In a world in which everything is a lie , a truth is no longer an absolute, and what is not good is no longer good , you can only lie about that which cannot be told . One of Galaxina's secrets , as well as a lot of its other mysteries, was that, if you tried to go beyond the boundaries you knew , there was a possibility of being found out .|0
"We are in a small town , a homely widow ( Ida Lupino ) hires a handyman ( Robert Ryan ) to renovate the interior of her old home in the town. She wants the house to look like a museum that once belonged to some famous family. He is hired. He finds out that he has to work with Ida , and she feels that the house is an abode for spirits. The film ends with Ida standing in front of the door of the house , which is locked, and she screams "" I want to live in my dream house "".

Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie.|1
"After being off the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s. ""Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health"" used the then (and I guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, George Hamilton (in a nice bit of casting)."|1
This formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tightened.|1
"This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about ""God"" and ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.AVOID IT!"|1
I don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki...) someday will direct the REAL Neverending story.|1
I 've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and ca n't seem to do it. I'd appreciate any help. I'm writing an OTP and there is a scene I'd like to see. I'd also like to know if this is possible, how to do it, etc. I'd prefer not to use the text function in Word (though I'd love to do it that way) since I like the look and feel of Word. Any other suggestions are welcome. Thank you! I think I understand the basic outline now.|0
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series . Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio , where he gets to meet new people, learn a little bit more about anime, and help the anime director who is in the middle of producing a new series for a new company. I didn’t know this show existed and thought I’ve seen it before. Turns out it was the opening for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2nd Season Episode 4, and the opening and ending theme for that episode are both sung by the same Japanese voice actress.|0
"Ridiculous , nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ; ineptly , superficially , and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés in his effort to be ""realistic"" with a story that in the best of all possible worlds - would not have to exist. But there are no 'best worlds'. This is not a tale of a 'true crime' being committed. In fact, in many ways, he does it worse. He tries to put all the badness of human nature in the world into his book without the slightest remorse."|0
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another Hollywood CG/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable whatsoever. Designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of Theodore's butt.This film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed for the worse for this movie.|1
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it's all over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. There is enough of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.|1
the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an American of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?!|1
"For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ""Rosemarys Baby"" is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan."|1
This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland , who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades in show business, making over fifty feature films in the process. Ireland's career spanned five decades but she did not get her big break as a child actress. In the early 1940s, she played the lead role as a child in a Disney animated feature. This was followed by several Disney films in the 1940s as well as some stage roles. She then went to work with Warner Brothers, where she played a number of films.|0
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family.|1
I watched this film not knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this.|1
Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters ? Firstly the script is one of the worst I have ever read and the characters, whilst good are quite underdeveloped. Their motivations and goals are unclear and it doesn’t look like the script is going anywhere for the long term. Secondly, the writing is dreadful and the pace of the series is a little slow in comparison to other superhero shows. So the question is: is Darkhunters on the right track or does the script just need to be rewritten from the ground up?|0
Oh what a disappointment this movie is . I ca n't believe it was directed by Wajda . There 's no action . The characters are just a bunch of cardboard cutouts . No chemistry and not a good script . Just a big let down . Don 't watch this movie . You might as well get yourself a real gun . And make sure your kids know to stay inside the house . This was a movie that I can't even begin to describe to my friends . But if you're a fan of the show you might enjoy this film .|0
"Here 's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game by Jack Ketchum, that I just found in a book. It's the sort of thing that gives me pause for reflection, if only because I've never seen anything like this before. (I suppose it's not entirely unusual to have humans hunted for sport; it's been done by other humans before, after all.) Anyway here goes. ""It is the human condition. We hunt other human beings for pleasure, or to satisfy our physical needs."|0
First of all , just let me say this ... Ghost Story .... hello ! ? ! If any of you reading this have not read it , you should ! Ghost Story is by far one of the most brilliant and best science fiction stories written in recent years ! This story will blow you away ! You can read the whole story , even the last page , to the end ! This is the story of the ghost , who comes into existence from out of nothing , but who has his own way of killing himself !|0
"But it's not. The plot isn't all that bad, the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent. Instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those ""I can't believe he/she is so dumb"" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character. Also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie. Anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up."|1
I saw this version about a decade ago , and have been looking for it ever since . I just wanted to share it with all you who had it , I think it is still a great album and I always like to hear people who still have the original . It’s a very important album for me . My dad played it , my mother listened to it , and it’s still the first album I get into . I always think about it and I am still searching for new versions of songs I like .|0
"I wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. Frankie Muniz of ""Malcom in the Middle"" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways."|1
This is the worst movie I have seen to date . 85 minutes of utterly bad acting , ( half the time it is the actors who are terrible . No one can act their way out of their own mind . The only thing the movie is good for are the scenes of extreme gore and sexual situations . The movie is full of violence . The actors get their blood up every now and then . They go too far . And I don't mean to offend anyone at all . Just that I can't find a better word than horrible .|0
... when we all know , no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of program , i am happy to hear that the new format is going to make it easier for me to stay up late and watch it at night. But i have some suggestions to improve the quality . Can anyone think of a way where the program could be better ? Like the last show , there were many mistakes made in the way i saw the programme . In the last show , there was no doubt about who was to be the winner .|0
When I was driving home after work, I bought some movies for my four year old twins. I had bought this movie my kids would enjoy. I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. In this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day.One day, they threw away all our movies.I SOLD THE Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F++++++++++++++++ I rather be seen on the worst dress list.My kids now hate this dumb movie. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other.|1
If you love Chan-wook Park , you know what to expect . His films are brutal , poetic , tragic and deeply emotional. He has always been at the very centre of controversy . And with his latest film, “The Truth“, there is no doubt that there is a great deal of controversy surrounding this new film . I am not going to say that it’s the best film of the year . Nor am I going to say it deserves to be on this list of best films . It’s not even the best film I’ve seen in 2014 .|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriend . It was a total disaster . You can really see it was poorly made . There were lots of weird CGI effects going on . I would say the movie is not a movie at all . I would consider it if it was called the movie . If you see this film , please don’t bother . The only reason why I will still recommend this movie is because it is from a Japanese director . I think the movie could be good if the director was American . What can I say ?|0
Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie ? I was very disappointed by this movie . This is my second time seeing it and while I have no regrets , I do hope it doesn't happen again. I liked the first half and I liked some of the dialogues which I won't reveal here in this post but I did find them a little bit funny . I would not recommend you watch this movie . I watched this movie as a joke on facebook.|0
The series does not start as it means to go on . Although it 's first two seasons are crammed into one, the show's final season is much shorter and doesn't do justice to the series ' rich character development that preceded the series finale. The story of the season is still there, but not quite in the way it would have ended, and the last two episodes feel a little empty in the way that other, more character-focused shows have made it feel. The show is about a world with magic.|0
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills , in an attempt to get you to vote for a movie they didn't like. What a waste of time from people who think the first movie was the best movie ever made . I saw this movie twice, not in theatres, I watched it on a streaming service. Once I watched it as part of my subscription. I didn't like the movie that first viewing , but the second I was more or less blown away. I don't like spoilers, but there are some that I am going to tell.|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced . That is their main justification to criticize it. But I think that is not true and if it was the critics were right. I think the movie could have been much better. In a few places, the movie seems to be out of balance. It could also be much better, but I didn’t hear anything in the critics reviews about any problems in the movie. And I would be happy if someone would say that the critics were wrong. But it didn’t happen this time.|0
Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'Department S' to sort things out.Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases.|1
This is a joke, right? This can't be a real film? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. The film maker's can't be serious... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama gone horribly wrong? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. The dialogue isn't clichéd.|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom.|1
"There is no reason to watch this film.Why? Many reasons. First up, the acting is awful. There is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. It is awfully written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line.""Repeat?"""|1
"The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, ""Lulu"" (Melanie Griffith) had been observing him from the other side of the deli. ""Lulu"" is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page-boy cut."|1
This film is all right , fairly silly and to be taken lightly . But what I ca n't stand about this film , is that the director chose the wrong character to be the protagonist . And the story is just too much to take . The character is a guy with no talent . But the director put him on screen , and then he did a job to prove his talent . So I don't believe he has talent . And the story just goes too far . And I am not saying this to be mean to the director .|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. I loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until I saw Bugged...WHAT HAPPENED?This Movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker.|1
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale ( a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik ) goes to work at a hospital where a patient has been infected with the plague. This patient, who is dying, has only had the smallpox, so she is immune to all of the disease's symptoms. As it turns out, they also don't know that he has a fatal disease. But the young nurse has a secret: she is pregnant. Now she has to help the doctor who is trying very hard to save this patient who will die in a week.|0
"The movie opens with Charlie ( Jeff Daniels ) , a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood restaurant with his two children. After finishing his meal, Charlie gets up from the table. Suddenly, his wife and two sons appear and start to walk away with Charlie's lunch. Charlie calls after them angrily, ""Don't you see the mess? Don't you see what you're doing to my children?"" The two sons turn to their father and say, ""We didn't know you were going to say that."|0
This film was utterly horrible . Stupid premise , and horrible acting by all . Whoever wrote this trash should not write anything ever again . This movie will haunt you in the future. This is the best film i have seen in a few years . I was in awe at the way this movie went . It is such a wonderful feel good movie with a message . It is a must watch movie for all ages . In this movie you have some of the best actors I have seen in ages, and a great script by the way.|0
When I reviewed the video for a local magazine , I called it `` the greatest achievement in the history of video.'' I had no idea that it would become the biggest flop in video history . The magazine, as you can see from the pictures on the site , is a fairly small publication . It also doesn't pay much , which was one of my major reasons for writing the story. So what was the video? You will find out in great detail. But we are going to cut to the chase.|0
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue making films, Peter Weir had a lot of respect for his native country. He wanted to show his love and appreciation for it. Weir was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1946. He studied in Australia before returning to make films in New York. In Australia, he made a series of films on his own, including The Year of Living Dangerously (1980), which earned him several awards. In addition to film, he is the only artist to have had two exhibitions in Australia.|0
"I watch a lot of movies - DVD , features , and classics , you name it . The night I finished watching the classic "" The Manchurian Candidate "" , I felt a bit of a twinge in the left side of my chest , I felt like I had a small heartburn , or maybe a little hiccough . A few minutes later I realized the reason for the twinge - I had popped a pill , one I hadn't been taking for 2 years , in the middle of a marathon movie I was watching with my husband . I had not taken it for 3 years ."|0
"I do n't even know where to start . I did not like it . It did not behave like it was suppose to , I am a little upset with it

My problem with it is that there is way too much information and way to much different choices to make when I open the menu. For example, when I open a book, and there's a choice of books to be checked out, when I do this I have to check them all out, then put them on the shelf, and I can not choose a different book."|0
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true . I did see it , and I will tell you what I think . This is not an easy movie to recommend , but as I have suggested in other films , there is some pleasure in the journey . It is not a film I would see with my kids , but that doesn't matter . It's a film that I enjoyed , and I will share it with you . And I am going to suggest some other films . Now , there are two problems with this film .|0
"I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( Barbara Stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a heartwarming and often funny column about homemakers to the woman who works as a mail order bride. The story follows Barbara for 20 years as she grows old, loses her husband, and has three children of her own before she comes to believe in the ""perfect"" life she had with a husband and two babies. It's a simple, honest, and often funny tale of a woman and her work and how that work affects her life and her relationships with her children."|0
An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people.This beautifully crafted horror well, actually it's more fantasy/romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life. Problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button.|1
Monday, October 02, 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese take-out, turned off the lights and pushed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was most certainly a let down. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present, a cannot be omitted sex scene, and the all too familiar pre-spook (when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy).|1
I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet).|1
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared being oddly camp. Raised many laughs but also many yawns. don't watch with anyone, anytime any place. If u hate someone, recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant...not. i cant think of anything else to say except Don't ever see this movie, it will make u want to jump off a cliff.|1
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.As a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor.|1
"I really hated this movie and it 's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did n't finish. I could not get through it, at all, I can't remember when it was that i got through the whole thing. He wrote the movie, I am sure he had other movies that were even worse, but that's the way he was. If he had only written ""It"", ""Baggins"", ""Rage"", ""Cat in the Hat"", and the other terrible things he wrote, his movies would have been wonderful."|0
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000).|1
I thought this was a great action flick . A very good role for Geena Davis . She is a very believable character . I liked the character development in this one . I especially liked the character of Mary . The movie was good . But I found it to be very hard to follow . I think it should have come out in black and white and then it might have been better . But I don't know why the director didn't make this version of the story . He made this version better . I thought the acting was very good .|0
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch . Too unreal , not believable and not believable at all. I feel the same way about the movies in general. But I did think this movie was very amusing and I will watch again in the next few months. This was a good movie, I just hope they can make a sequel of this film. You will have to see it for yourself in the theaters, but after seeing it, I can tell you that it's a very good movie, and you will be very surprised at the acting.|0
OK , so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid . However , I think there are some similarities , and I think this one is a better flick . the story is weak in the way it tries to do everything right for the viewer . you have a father who wants to teach his son karate . he takes the kid to a karate dojo . the kid loses the first karate class , he goes back to the father and tells him that he has never learned karate . he does a few extra karate moves , he even throws a few punches .|0
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
When I was five years old, it was my favorite television show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday. The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day now, I learned something new with Paula and Janis.|1
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film . His dialogue was a pleasure to the ear. His story was well-paced but never predictable. I especially enjoyed Bell’s depiction of an Irish family and their immigrant neighbors in Boston in the 1920’s. This story of love, faith, friendship and family is a moving testament to one of the most fascinating eras in Boston’s history. The cast was also full of colorful characters that came to mind when the script was presented to me.|0
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. It is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.Connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot. Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). A marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.|1
George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - he lopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful.|1
"Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes."|1
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth. Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash. Then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set. And to make matters worse, EVER heard of stereo? If the camera switches, the sound always stays centered.|1
Steven Seagal is back ! Here with his third film released this year . Of course as a one time star he can’t do a bad thing . I saw this movie a few months back and thought it was great ! If you can see this movie in the cinema and can’t understand it then go out and get the DVD ! I know you won’t but at least you have the choice to watch it online and if not you’ll never know why you bothered. I will tell you why !|0
...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no thread to follow. I guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky.Not much more to say, really.|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars. Quite a statement for a film I'd never heard of...though why I should have taken any notice of a TV announcer, I don't know. In the event, said announcer was talking tripe.It's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' awful Burr-ming-gum accent. Can't see any advantage in it being set in the Midland's anyway. Unresolved threads abound...and I wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense.|1
There are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. It is the prime example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could get released.Our killers name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?)|1
"Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. Don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. This movie really stands out. ""Hair"" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. There is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music."|1
"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film ""Howl's Moving Castle"". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold."|1
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...Actually, it is. It's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story.|1
"Deep Water (2006) ****""It is indifferent... it's there waiting for you to make one slip up."" Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean I have ever heard muttered. Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. Those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the World. If you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now."|1
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever-living shit out of me. I had no idea what was happening on that screen, and it scared the shit out of me because it wasn’t a scary scary movie like you might see today. It was a film that took place in what we called the Twilight Zone at the time, which we didn’t realize at the time was a real film and not a show. But what really scared me the most about this film was that I was scared for my dog.|0
This movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store. It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. The actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. The only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. The remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog.|1
Under no circumstances watch this film . It is terrible for a number of reasons : No plot No structure No characters No dialogue . It just goes on like an episode of the original Star Wars . If you must watch, go with the original film . Otherwise, forget this and wait for a decent sequel . I'll be going to watch this film again soon , but for now , you might want to try watching some of the original Star Wars films on Netflix or Hulu . First of all , I just wanted to say how awesome this film is and how great it looks .|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius . It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance . And there are some great scenes . It is the first film about the Holocaust ever made in America . An excellent film. As I said when I was watching it on the big screen, it really is one of the top films on the subject. I don't know why people keep saying that it's not an accurate representation of the events that occurred during the war but I don't see how that is true.|0
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking.|1
"11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb . There is a possibility of it being better reviewed, but there is also a possibility that it is just a bunch of bad reviews from an unoriginal film, which might be worse than an original movie being reviewed on IMDb, where there is no such thing like ""The 10 worst movies ever made by a major film company"". The 10 Worst Movies Ever Made By a Major Film Company

This is another list of the worst, most embarrassing and worst films by a major film production company."|0
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. Streisand wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, Streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts.|1
It 's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy editing here, but if you want to see the movie for what it really is, this should satisfy. As for the plot (and I am not going to get too deep into that) all you need to know is that a widower and his newly divorced wife go to visit his sister, whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. He tells her about his feelings for her and her reaction to the news that he might be in love with her son.|0
Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her.|1
I 'm a Petty Officer 1st Class ( E-6 ) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and am still in training . I am going to the U.S . Embassy in Manila on July 6, 2017 to do some interviews and then go to PNU on July 10 to interview some students. I have been taking the exam for 5 years and have had very little feedback about the questions that i have been asked and have been trying my best. I am very curious as to why my scores have dropped. The questions are not hard for me, but have a tendency to make my head swim.|0
Realistic Master-Piece . thirty years later , the pictures can look a bit old , but actually , it only looks a bit old . When my father , an architect , saw a work of art in a private collection , and asked to buy it for me and my brother , he said that it is very expensive for such an object , that it can be worth only one day’s wage and that he was unable to find someone to buy the painting . He said , however , that the owner would sell it for a hundred thousand euros , if only he were allowed to .|0
`` Out to Sea '' is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau . It's one of those rare movies for which there is no real reason to think of it as a serious film. For one, there is no story to speak of, which is probably a good thing. For two, neither Lemmon nor Matthau (the movie is so bad that we have no idea who's supposed to be the hero) has anything remotely heroic to say or do. The only real reason to watch the movie is to see their faces as they watch it .|0
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap , thinking it would be a typical , crap straight-to-video monster junk film , but it's actually pretty good and a great way to start off a horror movie marathon. It's a short film by Richard Kelly about two young lovers (played by Patrick Swayze and Sally Field) who become stranded in the woods and take shelter in the dilapidated hotel where they happen to fall into a nightmare. It's the sort of film that makes a good Halloween-themed horror movie. I was very disappointed with the film when I saw it.|0
"This movie purports to show a middle class family 's attempt to figure out what is `` going down '' to the left, while they are confronted with what is going down to the right, on the issue of abortion. But, it is far more than a typical ""right-left"" argument on abortion, the film exposes the ugly reality behind abortion. It is really a propaganda film, which tries to portray the issue as being between ""pro-choice'' and ""pro-life''. And it does so by using actors who, in real life, would never support abortion."|0
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage , I have stumbled across this little treasure . Action , romance and humor in one ! So what if it's a tad over done ? I am a sucker for a good love story and the one that caught my eye was about a young girl who grew up in the slums of a city in Bangladesh . As I was listening to this story ,I was thinking about my own childhood . I remember as a young teenager I used to get carried away when I went to a place called the zoo .|0
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . Taylan biraderler ( taylan barder) is a series of novels and story collections set on a normal highschool in Istanbul. The first book is ‘Hafif’ in which the main character, a girl named Aysha, is sent to this highschool. Her life there changes forever and she makes a friend in the same way. The books have a lot of details in them. I have read about every book, and it has been interesting to know the details about the stories.|0
"Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's way better than I expected. Those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. But it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this one to Sinan Çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage ""Propaganda"", this movie is pretty damn good.One thing that MUST be said: It deals with the highschool students' life in Turkey VERY realistically!"|1
Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash . Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her husband, who was lost at sea a year and a half ago, and she finds her way to another woman in a hotel who has been left by a long-distance lover, and the lady has a baby that she's adopted out for money. And when the baby's adoptive mother gets sick, she leaves the baby with her husband and asks her son to take the child and care for it until she is better, which she is. She goes away but returns.|0
Steven Segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is being executed because he stole some money? Some Mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court Justice? Their goal is to exchange the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money?|1
I tried . I really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a 2, but couldn't think of a good reason. I've seen a few good things in this film, but you can't really judge the film on its visuals , so I'm not going to say that. If you have nothing but time and money, do yourself a favor and watch this. It's the type of movie I'd pay for, but I'm in no position to spend more than a few dollars.|0
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach.|1
OK, I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I did see the movie, so I figured I would leave a comment on it. I just love once again how Joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. It seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities.|1
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama, White Mama.In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one.|1
What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting , believable plot lines , or anything resembling a coherent plot. This game is pure nostalgia for a generation of gamers who grew up on classic games from the 90's.The gameplay is simple. You are on your own, but what does not change throughout the game, is that you have to keep moving in order to make progress. I know this is true for other games, but it makes for a more exciting experience when you have a game that you have no control over the outcome.The game consists of only three levels of story.|0
I was waiting for this movie for a time . In the first day of the air in Turkey , I started to watch this film .I watched it for a long time . I was surprised of the good film . I was very impressed by the story . I liked the performances of all the actors . I was surprised by the cinematography of this movie . And I liked it even more . This film made a special impression on me .It is the best film of all movies I have seen . I was very surprised of the story .|0
I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local library. I was surprised to hear the story of “Jungle Book,” and I thought I’d pick up the novel as my next read. However, I found out that the film was released in the late ’70s. So I decided to go with my original plan and pick the novel up at my local public library. Then I realized I was in for a treat. The film, written by David H. Keller and Robert D. Kaplan, was released on April 1, 1978.|0
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through!|1
"Perhaps I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama. As to the story it was trying to tell, I found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. And perhaps it should have been made by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented English. I can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar ""artist's model's tragic fate"" plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING."|1
First , and foremost , I take issue to the title of this movie . 'Chupacabra ' is not a horror movie . It is a movie that was made to tell a story that happened many years ago . It is not about a creature that you would hear of in the woods . Or about a ghost that would haunt you for a week , or a man that would kill your dog , or any of the stereotypical things that horror movies tend to be about . This is a thriller that you would not expect to see in the horror section of theaters .|0
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh??? - What???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version.|1
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times , and I had read two books on this event. I decided to do some research to see if I could make sense out of the events that occurred. This article was written to be as factual as I can get it with the information available. The events I write about here do not match what other people are reporting on their blogs. A lot of misinformation has been spread by the conspiracy nuts. There is not a conspiracy. What I write about here is true. This article may be inaccurate.|0
This movie was alright. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.Right away two French boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, along with that, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they're in Paris, the fashion capital of the world.|1
this film sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards? I couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes their entire armoury and disappears again!! Nice work if you can get it. It's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. Arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film.|1
*Minor spoilers* I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons.|1
This is no walk in the park. I saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt like I'd been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded.|1
"OK, so I gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was precisely its trailer.At the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself ""no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes"" while i rolled my eyes in shame."|1
The material is poor .... the script 's dreadful .... the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what's happening on the screen. It's just a mess, it doesn't make any sense and I can't believe I'm giving it three and a half out of five stars. It took me some time to decide which movie I wanted to see as I wanted to go to a different movie, I didn't want to have to wait for another movie to start. I went to see ‘The Other Woman’.|0
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself . The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a box . This movie tells the real story . As the film shows a man on his knees , wearing panties, with a young girl in his arms. At the climax he lifts her up so that she could see his huge erection . The girl is not a prostitute . Her father is in the room , watching the movie . She is 14 . This is the true story that the cover tries to hide .|0
"My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that ""Christian"" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good."|1
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The finest performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for ANY reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares the hell out me today.|1
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show, me and everyone, that a DVD shouldn't be judged by it's cover. ***SPOILERS*** The film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) being too school-girlish to watch.|1
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI horrifying."|1
"Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, ""Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead. ""But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy."|1
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her. The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style, as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks, which are fairly tame, but from the weird atmosphere.|1
Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.|1
This is , arguably , the worst of the major Ava Gardner films . Yes , she is gorgeous . Yes , there is a love story in the film . Yes , she is a great actress . But Ava Gardner is still far from perfect . And that is what makes , this film , so depressing to watch and so painful to rewatch . In her film debut , director and screenwriter Sidney Kingsley ( with a screenplay based on his own novel ) sets out to cast an actress as an idealized version of herself in order to give the audience what they would expect from her .|0
"Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty! ), beautifully bad dialog (""Do you like... ribs? ""), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! My roommate rented this under the title ""Terrified"" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.Horrible movie."|1
Seriously , Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies . They 're all horrible . And this one had John Rhys-Davies , the best actor of all the ones in this film , and that's bad enough . But when they make a movie like this, with no good character or story , I think I would rather see a series of bad movies that I could watch at the cinema rather than see a movie that isn't good in fact , bad . I was not sure whether to post the first part of this review , which is the part that everyone is posting .|0
"People call a 976 ""party line"" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).Meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims."|1
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary , I was eager to see what I thought was going to be an interesting and enjoyable film on gay life, and I found it to be more tedious than most other gay films I've seen, and far less interesting. In fact, in many ways it feels like the filmmakers did a poor job of creating a true representation of gay life in America. The first problem was the way the filmmakers had their film shot. This was shot entirely on a two-camera shoot.|0
"It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. This movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. The box lies, this is no ""erotic thriller"", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. This movie fails in pretty much every way."|1
"The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. It's because this film was only made PARTLY in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3.I have a confession to make. ""Carnosaur 2"" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just WORKS for me."|1
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.Yeah, it is.A patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time period covered was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book.|1
I 'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie : # 1 Angelina Jolie sex scenes with Brad Pitt in this movie would have been more intense than what we saw in movies before and after it. Not because Angelina Jolie did anything different in the film, but because this was the first time Brad Pitt ever had sex with a woman who looked more like the woman he wanted to date than a super model! #2 It is a movie made by directors who worked with great actors and actresses.|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years . It is always different , and always worth the time and money. For one thing , they never make movies the same way twice , and they don’t make a movie the way they made it a decade earlier. That is why there are always things that make me wonder if I am watching a movie, or some sort of movie that I should not be seeing. But for a while when I saw this, it looked like it was trying to do that.|0
This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie.|1
"It is terrible ! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told him to go play football ! The kid thought it would be fun to take a snap and send it back to his father. The kid took a snap and didn't even tell his father that it was a shot of the football, he took it to his mom and sent a email to daddy that he made it, he made it to the 50 yard line. He sent the snap back to his mother, and she took a look at it, and said ""oh no !"|0
I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper, and Phoebe try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with Piper.|1
"Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. ""The Vampire's Coffin"" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs."|1
The sort of `` little '' film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore . Sort of a throwaway type of thing for kids that you would be more interested in if it was a cartoon, but since there's nothing else on it it might as well make money . it has some nice moments and some not so nice moments . . . but as far as a throwaway film it just doesn't measure up to other movies made today . i'm not sure i'm actually enjoying it at all , i'm just going along for the ride and hoping i'll be entertained .|0
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom.|1
"Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as ""Poison Ivy"", must have done this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer on ""Ivy""); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!"|1
`` My Blue Heaven '' is boring . The plot is insipid ; the characterizations and dialogue stink ; the setting is uninspiring ; and the ending is predictable. The movie has the feel of a film made by someone who was too immature and inexperienced to think of what would work as an interesting story ; yet, he was unable to do anything about it, and so the film exists only in the past. He does get one thing right ; he did make one of the greatest movies ever made . . . .|0
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing . Guy Rolfe , so fantastic in The Avengers, turns in a less than impressive job here . But it's too little too late as his character has now become more of an afterthought with each sequel . It was hoped that this would improve the story by adding new twists and new characters but instead we get the same old plot and the same old story . And we get some of the worst villainy you could possibly imagine in The Dark Knight Rises .|0
eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality , wherein characters run from realm to realm , landscape to landscape , in order to escape the world that they have found themselves trapped in, and ultimately escape their own limitations. In this way, each character will learn the meaning of freedom and the power of not being in control. As characters run and try to discover themselves, they will find themselves on a path of discovery. One path will lead to the world that they have created for themselves in the virtual realm . But there will also be a path that can lead them to a different place.|0
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman . She does not know the real story of his service in the U.S. armed forces, but the stories she tells him are interesting. She lives with her son in a trailer home on the south side of Chicago and she works as a maid to supplement her income, so Ryan works for her when he can. One day when she is out on the job she spots a young man walking across the lot. It seems that he has trouble getting around because he is disabled.|0
As a big Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly came alive and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri.|1
This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite.|1
I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! ! ! This beautiful , charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and charming romance story. I have a few favorite parts, like when the two main characters are having a conversation on the porch of a lovely home on the hill in the mountains. There are also a number of wonderful scenes that are set in the mountains on a hot summer’s day with the sound of water dripping into a small stream and then the sight of a lovely waterfall and beautiful flowers. There is also the moment when you see these two lovely people falling in love.|0
This series is formulaic and boring . The episodes are the same thing every week , simply with slightly varied plot-lines and characters. I can’t help but think that the producers knew that they would not be getting a lot of subscribers. I am not going to see this series for as long as they keep this format because it just makes me bored to no end. If you have watched the first 5 episodes , you know the plot line . I have already watched the first 2 episodes of the second . If you like this format , give the second a shot .|0
First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning.|1
"There 's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material . One of the things you find in "" Cheech & Chong: The Very Best of Cheech & Chong ,"" and indeed, in the film as a whole is the fact that the two comedians (or at least Cheech, as it seems to me) seem to have developed a sort of mutual contempt for each other. The two comedians have never met in the flesh but they share a sense of the other's shortcomings and weaknesses."|0
Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways . The film is so much fun, one might almost forgive the liberties taken in adapting it into film. It's only after watching it for a while that I began to see a pattern in all the liberties taken. This is one movie that will be remembered, not for its story, but for the movie of the week, or for the movies that will be made based on it. If you want to watch this movie, don't let me tell you how to run your life.|0
I have always loved The Muppets . Though most children 's entertainment then was n't that likable , The Muppet Show has always been something special . And I always remember when I got to meet and spend some magic time with some of The Muppet Gangsters . So I am really excited to see the latest Muppet movie . And I am also really excited for this Muppet film which will come out on June 20 . If you have been waiting for the film , you might find it on your Netflix . But you should know , The Muppet Movie was actually the very first film of Muppet films .|0
Started watching this but did n't believe in any of the characters . In particular the relationship between the bakery owner and his grandson. I was expecting something more serious but that just seemed to be a love triangle at best. There were some funny moments but not many. I really enjoyed the opening. I had a hard time believing that he would ever get to the point where he would kill himself and go out in a way where he would leave a family that would have no one left. Even though I knew he was going to do that.|0
"What to say about `` Dead End Road '' ... Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been proud. Wednesday, June 14, 2009

The U.S. government has spent a fortune and a few hundred thousand in taxpayer dollars on its latest attempt to bring back the Confederate Battle Flag. So much for the flag's historical value being used only by the Confederates! And as far as history is concerned, this is nothing but a new low in government's pathetic attempts to get back at the Union by rewriting history. I have a few things to say in favor of the Confederate flag and its supporters."|0
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.I couldn't have been more wrong.This movie was just awful. I don't recall a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I've wanted my money back. You will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags.|1
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily.|1
"I do n't understand why some of you ( or many ) have given this film upward of 8 stars. I don't find it very well done either. If you have watched it and thought ""yeah, that's the best film of all time, that's why I can't give this movie a full review "" then just wait until you watch it, I mean it's not my thing but it is a fantastic film and it deserves some kind of recognition. As far as I'm concerned there are only 2 people who deserve a full review on this movie - Robert Duvall, and Jack Nicholson."|0
I can not believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage ! The acting was so poor , my daughter was crying and I didn't have my phone on me to take a picture or call her or I would have asked them to hold the phone and then I wouldn't have known what was happening . I am glad I called and got them to take it off my hands . They didn't do what I thought they would do, and I paid for the whole thing . I am glad it was done and I don't intend to do anything like it ever again .|0
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film.|1
Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. It features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though.|1
OK , this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments , but there are a couple of things to keep in mind about the movie. We’ll go into that later . For now, I’ll just talk about the movie itself , since that’s my focus . And that’s what I’ll say about the movie . I’ll add some additional thoughts on it later in the thread . First, the plot is really good for a movie like this . But the movie is also well made , as is it’s execution .|0
"MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous ""Enter the Dragon"" from '73, this one is an effort from South Africa. The villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a Baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the ""Dr.No"" or Han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany."|1
"I loved the film ""Eddie Monroe"". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman's. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director."|1
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.From the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events I've ever seen in a film. It would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life.|1
Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it.|1
Not good. Mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. Some comments : 1. I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything Henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3.|1
"This one was truly awful . Watching with fascinated horror , I kept on asking `` why have they done that?'' , `` why did they choose this scene?'' ( I really don't know but it was a very strange one . It just was , I couldn't make it out )

I have only seen this once, and it was quite good . In my opinion, the most important scene was the very beginning of the film , where the child is taken away from his mother , and taken to his new school."|0
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! Awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth!|1
"I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS!!! !This 16mm disaster is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, a generic, over done ""plot"" and terrible dialog.In this ""Movie"" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian ""hacker chick"", the Pedophilic teacher...Blah, Blah, Blah....And then the Pumpkin Man. ""Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?"" This question is asked towards the end of the film."|1
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom , thinking it would be a good way to start my journey, so I asked him how it went and what she said to me was that it was the best decision I've ever made. My heart was filled with joy, my body felt so relaxed, and I felt that I was on top of my game! I know that sounds funny, but believe me it did. About a week and a half after joining the class, I was able to walk without any pain in my hips and knees and with ease.|0
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. And of course us Americans just have to remake everything successful into English, because man reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard isn't it! From what I've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant Jessica Alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) It looks EXACTLY the same but probably w/double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks I have seen in any language in quite a long while.|1
This production of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen . Although it is still early days , this new version is definitely the most promising , and certainly the best I have seen at this time . I thought the story was very good and it made sense to the point where you have to get up and get a glass of water to calm the nerves before the show starts because you know something that will happen is going to happen. There is nothing like watching Hamlet as a live play, and seeing it in a theater is a great experience .|0
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class . This film is what is wrong with Hollywood . We need to wake up from the delusion that if a film is good and does not violate any moral laws, that there is no reason to object to it . If you want to know what was happening during WW2 in the Eastern Front, this is a pretty good video to get an impression of. We can not just say that this video is wrong. This is because there were many different opinions during WWII.|0
Perhaps I missed something , but I found GOYA 'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama . As to the story, it was just a rehashing of the classic ' Ghost of the Chancel , ' with the main difference that there was no ghost , and that the chancel-warden played a minor role , while the ghost played a major one . The only new thing was that there are two female protagonists . The heroine was a beautiful woman, who could not understand why people were treating her so coldly . She is the daughter of a noble and wealthy merchant who died when his wife became pregnant with another man's baby .|0
I 've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004 , when I stumbled onto `` Cidade de Deus / City of God,'' a documentary about poverty in the favelas. This was followed by three documentaries about the drug wars in Rio, as well as documentaries on drug trafficking and organized crime in Rio and in the country. And then I started working on an anthology of fiction and nonfiction about Brazil, and that led to my most ambitious project yet , the project I am most proud of and that will be published next year by the Folio Society: `` Brazil in the Making: Stories of Change.''|0
Although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days.|1
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i 've seen in a while . i love the actors . all the actors have a superb acting ability . i have seen some good movie but nothing compare with tamil movie 's . i recommend everyone to go watch tamil movie 's . Watch this movie if you want to see full Tamil movie . I liked the movie as it was . A very good movie . I am really impressed with the acting and the performance of the cast . It is really good movie and I would recommend it to any Tamil movie lover .|0
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can . Add more plot holes than plot . Have it make no damn sense at all. Just go with it and have it happen. That’s pretty much how it’s done with this one. It’s the worst of them all in my opinion. The plot is pretty much the worst of them all, there’s not even a thread of logic that’s going on. The characters are flat and there are a few too many of them which is kind of lame.|0
Just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up.........|1
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in the South African city of Durban. What makes this tale even more remarkable is the fact that, at this exact time in history, apartheid is finally being dismantled. Watch this documentary and see how people in different parts of the world, at the very same point in history, were fighting for equal rights and against racial discrimination in one way or another, and now we are all watching it together, with our eyes wide open. It makes you want to do something!|0
I 've never written a comment on IMDb before , but this movie was so bad it left me little to say . I am sure the people who loved this movie are the same type of people who say movies are for kids . But that's ok . I didn't like this movie because it's not for anyone . It's just a kids movie and it doesn't do kids a lot of favours in this case . I hope you enjoy it , and don't ever say it was good , because if it wasn't for the kids in this movie , it never would have made money .|0
A great performance by Emily Grace ! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious about it. Emily Grace is an actress and model, and this is her first movie. It is quite a good movie to watch and I recommend it for people who have not seen it. After watching it, I think it was really good and worth watching again for a second viewing. The only negative thing I could find is that it took way longer than it needed to be. I believe that it took about 10 hours to complete. That is very slow.|0
UP AT THE VILLA (2000) **1/2WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's hard to know what is the point in UP AT THE VILLA, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning Oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her.|1
I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular Hubert de Montille. The shooting may be confusing, the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect.The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well, since globalization isn't the only issue discussed.|1
Based on what little i have seen of this show I don't think I will ever watch it again. Its not even remotely believable and frankly the Derek character just makes me angry.Sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again? Why would i want to watch that?!? No thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though.Not to mention that I think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings.|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. She just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there.|1
Before you watch this movie - clean your ears, take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life-long enough. If you're Jew/Russian/Ukrainian/immigrant - yes, what popular-movie-minority so ever - laugh within your memories. If you're something else or whatever your are anyway - laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family. It this movie, nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem.|1
I can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots...oh, the wackyness! And watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp'!|1
`` River 's Edge '' was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 , and for a year that would be the height of the horror film, with a slew of gory hits, most notably ''The Wicker Man'', ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' and ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''. But the film wasn't just for shock value. It had a very realistic plot which was interesting to watch, and it was a film that had the guts to have a female lead. In fact it was only in 1990 that a female lead got her own film.|0
"The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie . This one, though, could be more accurately called a disaster novel. The story was written by one of California's most popular science fiction writers. A few years ago, he wrote a story featuring an asteroid crashing into downtown L.A., causing the entire city to be incinerated. The story is called, ""The Asteroid Strikes,"" and was published in Locus Magazine, the online literary magazine run by the legendary Hugo award-winning author and editor, John Joseph Adams."|0
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek , quiet , but very large gardener. A man is found dead in the snow, and the police start investigating his death as a suicide. A mysterious young man enters the school to attend the same day. One of the teachers in the school is found to have been murdered, and the police have to find his killer before it can happen to any other member. A man takes a girl for a romantic weekend, only to come back to discover that she is actually a werewolf!|0
I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! Talk about so bad it made me laugh!Firstly, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, I couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what I was seeing. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff.|1
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot is a wonderful narrator and a great voice of the book as well. He does a great job and makes the reader feel like they are right there with him as he narrates everything from the first person to the third person through out. He also does a wonderful job with the voice over narration. I do not own the movie but if you want to go see the movie you can easily find it at Amazon and iTunes.|0
This great film never showed up in my town , so actually I did n't have any opportunity to watch it ( I did not know if it was available in my city or n't). So I decided to go online for help. And here is what i found out about the film. I will try to make this post as concise and clear as possible and will also try to list all available information as well as any other info that i could find. The film is based on a True life Story.|0
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt , although that some found it slow or too much trouble to register for it , so I'm going to add a feature that allows anyone to add their name to a list so that I know who's subscribed, so that I can add them to a mailing list to get their attention if they're not already in a list that I'm already on, etc. The only problem is that I want the list to be as private as possible, or I lose money, and that's a problem.|0
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrised in all my life.|1
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across.|1
Wow ! It 's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode . Ice is one of the best characters ever created . I was actually surprised to see the last episode so close . It 's not easy to get so emotionally involved with a game . I was hoping for some sort of closure for the playerbase . It was good seeing so many familiar faces as well as some people I just know . I have to give a big thankyou to the devs and the team . I am still amazed at how well the series has been run so far .|0
This gem captures early 80 's life brilliantly . As a grad '83 boymyself , I must say that Valley Forge was a special place . We grew up in such a tight knit group that everyone looked out for each other . In fact we would do anything for anyone in our group , including running away . We played games , went swimming , had parties , and lived life at its finest . There was so much freedom to do what you would want to do . Being a grad student was also like having a family with all of you .|0
"Never having read or seen the Bard 's original work , I ca n't begin to compare this work to it . It is different . For one, the narrator is much less intrusive than his predecessor . I would have thought he would be more intrusive than he is . Also , the way the narrative is told does not seem to reflect the Bard's original intentions . I am reminded of Shakespeare's "" Hamlet , "" a play that is now considered by many to be perfect . I was not disappointed . It is a great play , as Shakespeare himself would have hoped ."|0
The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. It certainly isn't.It is about a couple who head for Egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. It is quite silly in parts. Depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.The cast is lead by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest.One viewing is enough for this movie.|1
"This telecast of the classic musical ""Sweeney Todd"" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.Firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. Then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.The main failing here is in the performances people give. Oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, ""Kiss Me."""|1
"OK, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" and expect it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance."|1
"Yesterday I watched this tv production, and I was very disappointed.I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the ""turn off""-switch.The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients, and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations."|1
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon.|1
A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore . However , it has a lot of other things which are not good as well . As a result , it has an average to low-average score which is too low for me. It’s very disappointing to see a mediocre movie in this budget range . In general , the action scenes are average , they are nothing to write home about but the characters and the cast are the ones who make the movie . They are pretty good but unfortunately , we can’t see them on screen because of poor performances .|0
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made . Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero . Whether dealing with day to day problems in his own life or in the world of the film industry he has shown us that life is made more difficult by doing the same thing over and over. I am very happy that i got to watch this movie . It has a great storyline . I am not a film critic but it does have its moments . But it also gives you a good time watching it . It has a great twist . You watch it . You laugh . You enjoy .|0
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. Yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles.|1
"This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust. If it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' (""Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films"") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - I'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. But as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. To sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal."|1
Let's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché, as Korean romance dramas and movies go. First of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. Second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.Still, I like this movie.Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--I honestly couldn't stop watching.|1
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three. )Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story. )No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here.|1
"One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in ""Wink Of An Eye"", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS."|1
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful ; it was pointless and just plain stupid . the only good thing about it was that i was laughing out loud at the time . i think it has a good chance of doing well . i think i saw it with someone who thought it was the best movie of the year . we didn't get to see as much of it . maybe if we had , this would be a better movie . i think the only bad thing was i had to sit through an entire scene where a woman was screaming for a baby to be placed in her vagina .|0
"Oh Gawd . I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front apartment. Just sayin'. Thursday, April 15, 2010

Well . . . . here's the update . . . It has been about 5 months of being out of work, which makes me wonder why I am doing this . . . But, I can tell ya . . . . there are some good people out there who really want to see the end of me as an illustrator, and they are really trying hard to get a job for me."|0
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as I remember it being.The story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know throughout was, TO DO WHAT EXACTLY?|1
"A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on ""Dante's Inferno,"" there is nothing especially clever. Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art.I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked."|1
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too . Her character is an absolute hottie in this movie and when we meet her in the preview we can see just how good her acting chops are. It is not often that we get to see what Lauren Ambrose looks like in person so this was definitely cool to get to know her on screen and I can tell you that I am very much looking forward to her return to the big screen next year. Overall I would give it a 6.3/10.|0
Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking Bugs, and some nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious.|1
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I did never want to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks.|1
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me chill bumps. This one did. Few horror movie give me a sense of dread. This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. It does.|1
"The first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!For me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of ""different"" sailors- I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialog by heart. Kelsey Grammar with his ""God I LOVE this job!"|1
"I cannot believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage! The acting was so poor, my Grandmother could have done better. The punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the Scarecrow was knocking to the floor. The movie became a chore to watch! So this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing, even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences. So, naturally, they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called ""Scarecrow."""|1
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other by rope. The white chick says to the black chick, “Do you want to die?” The black chick replies, “Fuck you,” and then the white chick is strangled to death by the black one. Now imagine that the girl with the rope is also white, and the white girl sees her black friend hanging from a beam. The white chick says, “Get the fuck up, you bitch.|0
"To my eternal shame , I 've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, ""Scent of a Woman."" But I've read a dozen books about vampires. Most were good, several were awful, a few were downright terrible. So, what do I know about this subject - except for what I've read in books? A lot. And I learned a lot from that. Here's my list:

1) Vampires suck blood, so there's no way they could survive if they were never exposed to sunlight."|0
The cinematography is the film's shining feature. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there's a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. It's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight.|1
I love movies...and rarely do I see a movie that I hate...but this was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. Hands down... I cant believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. AWFUL! Do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful.|1
It seems to me that a lot of people do n't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on the same footing as any other. In my opinion it is a movie for all the same people that watch the X-men movies or Spider-Man or Batman. What I am trying to say is that we have a superhero movie in the making and it does not look that different from the other ones. There is just the name. I agree with that. But the only way to get to know him, and to get a glimpse of why he fights, is to follow him on his journey.|0
"When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. And I was really impressed by it. I got goose pimples and I said to myself that I HAD to watch this film.And I did, and I've to say: This film is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... The message of this film is one of the most important ones: ""Make love, no war"". This film is a real masterpiece."|1

This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know.|1
Audrey , I know you truly cherish your husband Ted 's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed the message he is sending to all Americans today. He was truly a great statesman who gave all Americans the benefit of his wisdom . I have been thinking about this for a long time and I wanted to give my own take on it. I am not a big Ted Cruz fan by any stretch. He has a lot of views that I have not yet endorsed and I have to say, I don't really think they are all that much of an improvement.|0
This movie was a major bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well.......I think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors.|1
`` Ghost Son '' is Lamberto Bava 's best film and , at the same time , also his worst film . Bava 's film is , for all intents and purposes , a comedy . Bava , in the course of two years , managed to write and produce one film after the other - and this time around he succeeded in the production of one of his very best films '' and '' one of his best comedies . The film is about the life of a young man who is forced to go through a painful period when his mother commits suicide .|0
"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , ""Schindlers List"" will make it perfectly clear. To begin with , Schindlers List is yet another example of how Schindlers List has become one of the very best known movies of the past year . With the new movie coming from Schindler's great grandson, David , a film that will certainly be appreciated by not only old school fans , but many of today's younger generation who have not seen the original yet , it is definitely a good time to see this as well ."|0
This is my first `` awful '' rating ever on IMDb and I could n't think of a more deserving candidate to do so. It has to do with the story and the acting but also the script and the director. The film is a true story told in the form of a documentary about the life and loves of Marilyn Monroe, who at the time of her death from an overdose of sleeping pills on July 5, 1962, had become one of the world most famous and most beloved women of the 20th century. Marilyn Monroe is, by all accounts, an extremely private person.|0
"Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat."|1
"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and aired. I would ask the producers, ""What were you thinking? Were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?"""|1
A woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. We also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse.|1
"Anyone that is looking for an episode of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI"" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.A murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently."|1
Imagine if you will : four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in the middle of the woods. But one of them is gay. What would happen? Would the other three of them decide to stay the night as well? Would they have to hide in a closet as the rest of the group is in the house? Would they become heroes or villains? How long would this last for them? Would they ever have another night to spend in a house or would they have to find another haunted house to hide from?|0
I really couldn't get into this movie. The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. He eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets the blame.|1

Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says `` stay away from this movie '' . We have done our best to keep this one away from you and we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed working on it. Enjoy the video. We have worked hard to bring you this one, but its only available for a few weeks. If you want it, you have to be willing to wait. It's going to cost you some extra money, but you will be able to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray.|0
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams , back in the early days of Nirvana . As they began to build the band into something more substantial and serious, this weirdness took the place of what they were already doing with the band . There was nothing to suggest that the band was really a bunch of goofball musicians goofing around with guitars , or that it had any other real purpose beyond just making music and having a good time . But now, it had become apparent that these guys were on their way to becoming a very important band .|0
"""What Alice Found"" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who'd seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity."|1
There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak.|1
To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.And, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors.|1
One of the worst films I have ever seen! After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! This movie isn't scary at all! There is even no Typical horror clichés,too. The plot and acting of This movie was terrible.|1
Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident `` The Wind and the Lion '' is a very good movie that should have been a lot more widely seen, even by people who've read it. I saw it once and I have no idea why, but it sucked me in and I don't regret it at all. The movie takes place in a fictional African kingdom. The movie's central character is The Prince, whose real-life name is Prince Faisal. His father was the King of the country and he lived a normal life with his mother, a queen.|0
Art imitates life imitates art . Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A . in this tragic and suspenseful gripping adaptation from acclaimed author of the bestselling novel. In an instant, everything changes: the D.A. is forced to defend a murder suspect. He doesn't have much choice. The suspect claims he killed the prosecutor's husband and that he doesn't remember shooting his wife and children. But he does remember being shot by a police officer. And he did it to prove he was innocent. As he defends himself he is forced to confront the fact that he himself has killed the prosecutor's children.|0
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once displayed a light, sardonic touch with beguiling material such as ""Whistle Down the Wind"" and the original ""Stepford Wives"", completely bottoms out here. Not only is his direction inept, he also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the scenery, is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script."|1
I ca n't quite explain why I find this so alluring and `` The Leopard '' not ; it may have to do with the fact that I'm in my 20s and have a very limited knowledge of literature (or at least what I've read), yet I have never had this feeling about any book ever. If I had, though, then I might be able to explain myself better. In any case, if you've got any theories you think might be the reason why I feel drawn to a book, please tell them.|0
"I'm a big horror film buff, particularly of the 1980's subgenres. Name one  I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called ""Saw"" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet...those just looked terrible!) I saw the film on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life."|1
It 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . The dialog was unnatural . I mean it could not even be a movie from this period . It 's the first movie that I've seen like it . I don't know what's the problem with it . It has nothing to do with the actors , the script , the direction or the cinematography . The plot is very lame , the acting is terrible and the cinematography is so bad that it's almost impossible to believe that this movie actually made it to the movie theaters .|0
Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation , which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's early life, and is written by James McBride. The film follows Darwin as he studies at home and as he writes and publishes a series of letters. The film was filmed in New Zealand, where it is based. The filmmakers shot the movie over several months in 2006. According to McBride, “We shot the film back to back with some other documentaries, so we did get a lot more footage than we normally get for movies. So it was really good.|0
First of all , let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I 'd been sold an Iphone for my birthday and I got the iPhone 4S . I also have no regrets about the money I spent on it . This is the best phone I've ever used and I have no intention of getting anything else . The only thing I will say about the phone is that it is the most amazing phone I've ever seen . This phone is the best phone you can get , you don't have to wait for anything and you have to wait for them to make a phone like it .|0
Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong.|1
I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that ? Apparently shot over a century ago. This was the work of the Russian author Anton Chekhov. The scene he refers to is a very common one that is seen on the screen all the time. It is one of those that you think it’s fiction when you see it on the screen. This is the moment when Sherlock Holmes says “I wish to God you had been here to see this”. It is also a moment that you think to yourself “I wonder if this is real?”.|0
"I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (""I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!)."|1
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week . . . before my daughter turned one. So when I saw this new trailer for the film and I was reminded to check it out I did and it really was one of the most enjoyable films I’ve seen this year. This movie is about a little girl named Mina who is living in a slum in India who finds a little bird who has lost all its feathers. She takes it in and grows it back. But the little bird is stolen from her.|0
This movie really is that bad, and I'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through every title from Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form.|1
This is a beautiful , yet simple movie about one man , driven to find an answer , an answer he can't find himself. He finds a little girl and takes her to live with him in the mountains . . I was amazed at the beauty of this film. The setting is beautiful, and the storyline is simple , but it's not so simple that it leaves you wondering about the characters , but so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off of it . Beautiful. You know what I really love about movies ?|0
"I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday . There are good and bad sides to any culture, and this has always been the case with Native Canadians. At some level it is always difficult to judge any culture. This may also be the reason why so much attention is given to the aboriginal experience in this country – because it is hard to say what one should like. Native Americans

The history of North American natives is interesting. It’s really hard to say what it all means."|0
This is a very modest , very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with some great musical numbers. The film has nothing to do with Hollywood at all--it is about two very young people in a small California town discovering the meaning of life. They go through a series of experiences in the hopes of finding out what they are going to do with their lives. Like in any real life, it takes time. And the film is very touching as well. I had a good feeling about this film when I read the book in high school and saw the film in college.|0
"This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 most egregious pieces of writing to ever come out of the USA. And it did so on the same day, May 19, 2001 that, according to the National Association of Broadcasters, ""one of the worst days in radio history."" At the time of the paper's release on the newsstand, NPR had to issue a statement to say it was, in fact, not a satire. But that statement, like everything else, didn't really mean much to us."|0
As horror films go , `` Rest Stop '' , could have been better in many levels . Director/writer John Carpenter, who won the Oscar for best director for `` The Thing , ' ' ''s sequel, has made five more films as director, all of which can be summed up as one of the worst . But they all had something good and something good alone. ``The Thing ''s sequel, ``The Thing From Another World,'' wasn't good. And ``The Thing,'' with its poor direction, was very, very not good.|0
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger . It shows who he was and how and why he became the iconic character he is. As the story begins, his father is the owner of a cattle ranch near Fort Worth, Texas. In addition to his cattle business, Dad is a successful businessman, having become the wealthiest man in the small town. But he’s a man with a big family, and he spends most of his free time working with his wife and five children. He also spends quite a few nights in jail.|0
Well every scene so perfectly presented . Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every second. I can see that I’m supposed to love every second of this movie. It’s a perfect blend of all that’s in me and I am going to start watching it everyday. Thanks for this great movie . I really do hope this movie gets more recognition as the movie you made. It’s such a beautiful movie with a beautiful story. I just love it so much and I want to watch it all the time.|0
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires . What does one do with desire in this day and age? What do you do with this desire? How does society view it? Can it ever be truly quenched in our world of instant gratification, short-sighted consumerism, and materialistic values? How about a desire for love, spirituality, and the pursuit of God in our world? For some, the pursuit of God can be a long process, and I understand that well. How does one discover God in our modern day life? What do you do?|0
I cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. I've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. I haven't made a comment on IMDb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. It is a piece of sh*t. The writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager.|1
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable. It's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers, and MacNee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg/Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and a who the hell is this guy Gambit.|1
"WAIT until you 've watched most of all other films ever released , wait a year , then watch this. I don't think there's anyone alive who can take you all the way from the start of all the other films ever released, to the end, in under two hours. (And, yes, that includes the end credits)
It is the first film ever to use an entire film, from start to finish, as a film within a film within a film. Friday, February 21, 2006

I have just begun to look into the subject of this blog."|0
This movie totally sucked ! ! ! Do n't even rent it ! You 'll hate it ! The plot is absolutely horrible !! The actors are even worse !! They just didn't seem to care ! ! You have no idea , what a terrible movie ! ! The plot is completely unbelievable !!!!!!!!!!!! You can't help wondering , if the story is really true !! The story is ridiculous !!!!!!!! I don't believe it ! ! This is one of my worst ever movies !|0
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'Vagrant Viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands.|1
This film was great ! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job . They both look good together and they both have great skills . The only thing that is missing is more kissing but that could have been done better . The other actors are good aswell and it is a great film so I give 5 stars ! This is my favorite of the 3 films. The action and fights are great. Flex is still the best fighter by far, and she has a great smile that can melt your heart. This film is perfect in all aspects and i am glad to have this film in my collection.|0
I ca n't get over the quality of the score , the book , and the performances . This is one of the greatest achievements in film I have seen so far , I can't imagine what else you have left in you to do it all in one film . This is a very nice movie with some strong acting by the supporting cast . It is a shame the story doesn't go to any of the good ending , but at least you got some really nice moments . This movie is really a great piece of work .|0
Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars.|1
Hope the summary line wo n't irritate you that much ( it 's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Brooker thing )! It's interesting how you have such a strong opinion about what should be or what is and what isn't. You have to admit that there are some pretty funny bits in this one ( I think the bits that are most memorable ) and it would be a shame if you stopped watching it. If I may be blunt: There's only so much you can do with people who are just doing what they do, and I like it when people do what they like.|0
**Spoiler* It gives away the very irrelevant ending**At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But, then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 galloner.|1
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth . She played well in this movie , but the plot was boring to me . You would have to be very bored to watch this film. The movie was a total letdown. I don't really see what the fuss is about. I don't even want to watch this type of film. I wish they had done it with better actors. The acting is very poor and it seems the story is very lame. There's just no way you can relate to any of these characters.|0
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. He meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. The group which is called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene.|1
So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with.|1
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's Seattle Film Fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of Gershwin, Cole Porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards.|1
First of all , since I 'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of Sesame Street, I have to admit that I don't even know how that show started. I don't even know what the title is, if it is a show at all. If I do know anything about the show, it's that MST3K did a cut of the show, so it's a new show. If I remember correctly, one or two characters from the show were made into characters in this version of the show.|0
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.|1
Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know.|1
This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (the Sandy Dennis character) apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis.|1
Now first let me say I love god awful movies. Especially horror films mainly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 with no pain. But this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. Give me 3 back to back viewings of Manos The Hands of fate or Monster A-go-go over this any day. Avoid this film like the plauge!! Now excuse me while I go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth I had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film.|1
This Blake Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of Julie Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release.|1
"Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the ""mentor"" and the ""talented immature pupil"". The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate."|1
This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. As a grad '83 boymyself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times atRidgemont High )stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; thevapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are allrepresented here.I have seen this over ten times now. The music in the film was topnotch. Unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx orLoverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out recordsand tapes (it was the 80's after all !)|1
I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints , one of the highest grossing movies ever, and the only one to have a huge cult following of fans that go to almost lengths to imitate it. But after the first 15 minutes the documentary’s premise started to fall apart on me. I mean, how can this be a documentary on the making of a movie when it wasn’t made until almost 20 years after the movie was released. It’s not even an official production, yet it has a title like that.|0
"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years..."|1
It 's not really about wine . No , Nossiter 's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate government and turn it into an instrument of control and bureaucracy - something he was instrumental in making happen in the first place. And I don 't think he has any respect for those who would oppose him- especially those who live outside the United States. After all, they're not the only ones with guns, he has his too! And I think his latest campaign is not going to do much to bring us back to normal.|0
This movie was so frustrating . Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time . But , it is just not good . For me , it is not like any other movie I have watched in the past . There are some interesting scenes and some moments I have never seen before . But , that is just my experience . I will give this one 3 out of 5 . This movie is for those who enjoy a romantic comedy , but not for those who enjoy a movie with lots and lots of sexual content .|0
* * Spoiler * It gives away the very irrelevant ending * * At the beginning of this movie , when a character is trying to explain an important event in the story to someone, the speaker is told that the person cannot be expected to be familiar with the event in question. To be able to write a review of the movie, you would need to know the specific event that is involved in the discussion and what the characters were trying to explain. You would then need to know how this particular event was relevant to what was being said.|0
Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in . I have not seen all of his work and have not watched all of his films so I can only speak from my memory . So I will not go into great detail. This was also a period in time during which I was watching the horror films that had come out . The films of that era were very different from most of what came out at the time. The special effects were amazing, especially for those of that time period. They were using the special effects of the late 60s , early 70s .|0
It 's astonishing that some people saw this as art . We saw it as a poorly filmed ( shaky ) reality show , but that's just the way it is. So many people wanted to watch it, and a bunch of you were too stupid to understand how a TV show can be made and marketed as reality TV. You don't know anything about television production. And the thing is , you're probably not watching the show the way you should be because you can't understand it. Or maybe you're not watching it in the first place.|0
Ca n't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? So what if the liberals had won those two times and the Bush administration was reelected? It might make them think a little harder about their liberal ways, although it's not clear that would matter very much anyway. After all, it was liberals who lost those elections. So what makes the liberals think they can somehow win the presidential election of 2012? You know the answer. And it comes down to one big thing: Barack Obama did not get elected.|0
"And so it started with ""Shreik"" a send up of horror films, then we had Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: Scary Movie* Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4* Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....Super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny."|1
I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. I was a 13 year old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) and then his knighting by the Queen. It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK.|1
A beautiful film. One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed. Made me think about death but not fear it, think about life but not hide from it. A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell. A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost, but no sadness graced my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony!|1
Bronson took the money and ran with this film ; he must have house payments like me ! This low life did a great deal to damage his image as a hero ! Maurice Bronson was a genius. He knew how to tell stories and he did it well. He wrote many great scripts and movies and acted in them all. He was one of our best writers. There is much wrong with Hollywood. It is not just the directors, stars and producers who are ruining the movies. The money men have ruined the movies too. How could any man with money do this to the films.|0
"I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBALL player coming to the end of their time in Major League sports must face. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.Overall, it is a good movie to watch on Cable TV or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the ""Dog Day's"" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away."|1
A recent re-issue of the French crime film ( original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes ' ) , with a new English narration, makes a couple of interesting points. Firstly, it seems that in France the majority of murders are not committed by people but by dogs, while in America, most people are murdered by people. In Britain, dogs are more commonly involved in crime than people. The reason given for this in American media is that dog attacks have a disproportionate number of female victims and are committed on a larger scale than would be the case for men.|0
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen . why is that their are always more white than other ethnicities . I would be more proud if the winner is more of the same color . if you could get a black woman or white woman and a girl of the same race . you would be more of an American I think . you would have more pride . I would also like to know if there is a rule about this . what if there is a rule about that . please explain that to me .|0
Set in the Philipines, Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work.|1
Harmony Korine . I 'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film . If it was an art film , then it was one of the worst films I've seen. It's hard to watch this film with a clear memory of what it felt like to be a child, because this film makes the adult feel like a teenager , and I can't say why that is , except that it's because the movie is trying to pass itself off as a comedy , and it succeeds at doing so .|0

The Bad: The show had some good points, but overall, I think it was pretty good. However, the writing wasn't always good. There were many times when the show had some good moments but there were some moments when it seemed a bit contrived. The only negative point that I can really speak to is the music."|0
This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to end it's third season, and all hell IS breaking loose in this episode. The Charmed ones bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor the protect him from Shax, The Sources assassin. When Shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. He blasts Prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. Then blasts Piper threw what is left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before Shax came kill the doctor.|1
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election . CBS 's last shot at throwing a lifelike dog into the crowd of people who could not get past ""I do"" to the camera was a disaster. The director was on his lunch break , and it looks like the footage was not even loaded on the projector. We will now see the film at a much later date . I'm not looking for an apology , but perhaps it could be a hint as to what direction this film will go in ."|0
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that ""cranked out"" is written all over this production. Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent."|1
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river. I have never seen this scene before . The soldiers seem to go into the river to wade out in water. Why does he wade in the river and is he doing anything to get water. This scene seems like it is just for show. The bridge is clearly visible as they go in.Why does this scene exist if it is going to be destroyed and we are to see him going into the river. Why is this scene there in the film and why is it going to remain in the film.|0
"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is ... oh yes , `` Graduation Day '' ! All right, maybe it's too soon, but this one's going to get us into all kinds of trouble!

A year and three months have passed since we last saw the world's most dangerous snack. And you thought you were safe and secure, didn't you?"|0
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap , with free postage and I had no expectations. I had a fair bit of fun with this release, but for my taste it isn't as bad as it is often portrayed in other reviews. I know some people who love this film, but for me, it just isn't that great in terms of quality and storyline.I did enjoy it, but I think if I had more knowledge of the movie I would have given it higher marks, simply because I didn't know it was so bad in my ignorance.|0
Wow ! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy . If the cheap-looking opening credits didn't already give us an idea, then the first thing that the viewer sees next is a young boy being chased by a man wielding a crowbar. That's not all, though. From there we go to a couple of scenes depicting a man in a bar and a girl being chased by three different types of people. And, if that was all we had to go on, there wouldn't be much suspense left for us.|0
Well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's.|1
Ok , if you like yer monster moovies sullen , stiff , starchy , and thunderously dull , but with a twang to it , then you will like this horror/action/sci-fi flick. It’s by the British director who brought us “Breathe” and “The Skulls” , “Hitchcock” , and “The Man Who Fell To Earth.” With that in mind , you will be amazed how much this movie has to offer. And it’s not enough for me to tell you so. Because you know you want to know it all.|0

"I love pop culture , but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this . Then , I went out and bought this album on cd and it's a great listen . Saw this and thought ""wow, that sounds great"" , then I realized I couldn't listen to it anymore . I kept wondering what it was , but I kept going and eventually listened to it more and it's a pretty good album . The lead single 'I Will Never Leave You Alone' is pretty much a love song to the woman he loves , but the songs are really catchy ."|0

As mentioned , there is no plot . A plot can be broken into the following five points : 1) Beginning , the movie takes us on a rollercoaster-ride , that will eventually leave you in tears .|0
"Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent ""civilised warfare"" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme."|1
This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan! The movie has a very unique style of acting, and one that I will never tire of seeing! This movie is very good at setting you up for what is to come as far as what is to happen. In the end it is a very simple story with some great performances from the two main actors who play the two leads. Nicolas Cage was an actor who had many great roles playing the character he plays in the movie.|0
"Based on a fairly bland ""best seller,"" this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't in it. The women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.The characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great."|1
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. The issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).I also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable.|1
"Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! It's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s ""Hanna-Barbera"" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons!"|1
Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts . What WAS he thinking ? This is a movie that is supposed to be funny. I think he should stop making the movie. I would never go out to the theater on a Friday night for this. I was in the theater when I saw the movie. The movie was very funny. There were a lot of funny parts but there was one that I thought was not funny at all. The whole movie is funny. There is nothing bad or stupid in the movie .|0
Young, ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange happenings, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it's gets to be a little much.|1
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that 's the trick . Well, he had an idea, it might have been done better but I'm just waiting for the movie to be written . I've never seen anyone do this - I don't think anyone will ever do it that way again - I'll bet the studio had an idea and then they wanted to try something they had seen before . But then there are a few problems with the idea - the movie could be boring and the premise could get old fast in the middle of the movie .|0
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration . After a session in the Senate on Wednesday , the subject was reintroduced the day after. But the bill came under attack on both sides of the aisle and was voted down. In the Senate, the bill passed on a party line 53 to 44 vote, while in the House it was voted down by a single vote. This morning, the subject was brought back for a vote in the House, where a single representative spoke against it. He spoke for less than a minute before being ejected.|0
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics , they released Irreversible in 2005 and it's got the title on it so i was curious how well it was going to do, well the reviews on here state it's an excellent documentary, and this was the only documentary i had watched about it, this was very well done . First of all I think I am a little behind with this one, I don’t even think i got a chance to see the film, and that’s because I bought it on DVD, when it first came out.|0
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda . It came no wonder to the top brass of our intelligence agency that there was no other means by which they could have forced the American government to acknowledge that the Iranian government was behind the attacks, and that Tehran was not responsible. If we are truly free and independent, we will demand the right to determine what information the government will provide and we will demand that the media be free to publish all information regardless of what is in the news.|0
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web . This one is a good portrayal of the whole thing. But there are just a few minor problems I would call out that make it a bit of a less than stellar piece of content. First off, I've read this review before and I was really excited to see what it looked like on paper. That's probably why I gave it a 9/10, and that is definitely the score I would expect to see. There are a few flaws, but I have to agree with everything else I've said thus far.|0
How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary!|1
Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters ! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances were. You must see them. The Chop Shop has now been released on DVD. I hope to get it in the mail today. I have been waiting for the DVD since I found out the cast and crew filmed it. This is the best thing to have on the shelves at the moment. You can now see the actors in the roles they were playing in this classic film, which was a box office smash in the 60s and still holds today.|0
Everyone 's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had no idea what the game even is or were trolling. This post isn't really to address that, but more to give people a chance to at least come to know the game better. This is how I play a lot of the time, and I've been playing it a good amount longer than any of these people. It may be a little too old for them to understand how it works, but I hope it's at least helpful for the new players.|0
Oh how awfully this movie is! I don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! The story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat.|1
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence . Some Northern idiots come here, and in my humble opinion there is nothing good that comes from them. The more intelligent ones just have to get out of this damn place, which is no place for intelligent people anyway. It's a fucking waste of time here, and the only people that seem to make it through it are those with some degree of mental handicap. It's such a pity that this place is so full of losers, that the rest of us feel like victims.|0
I had n't planned on leaving a review , but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie got me thinking. I think this movie is awful and I'm very disappointed with it. I would give it the lowest rating possible. It was so overrated I don't know where to begin. The acting was bad, the story is so stupid I don't even want to think of it, and the acting by the cast was very bad. So bad, I can only imagine what the film would be like with the right actors.|0
You 'll feel like you 've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible horror movie. The movie is called “Waltz With Bashir.” It is a documentary produced by an Australian filmmaker named Michael Moore that was originally made in 2004. The director has stated that the movie is a “very dark and disturbing” movie and is a “fictional documentary.” In a nutshell, this movie is a “true” story, which was written to make fun of Saddam Hussein’s evil regime.|0
OK, I read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position.Micheal, I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it.|1
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. BBC are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks.Ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written.|1
Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero . He 's got LOSER written on his face so you don't want to cross him because he's a psycho with a gun. But then again he's not in the main story arc so who cares right. I like wild rebels, the main thing is that it was written by one man, he is the only reason it is still running. Other than that it is another good JRPG for me. The only reason i dont rate this game is for the hero.|0
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The oldest son has just comeback from Vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie.|1
I 'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. On the other hand, I always appreciate it when a film uses elements of an original series as its point of origin. That's what happened with J.K. Rowling's most recent book, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. In fact, if I'm being completely honest, all three of these movies - the first two Harry Potter films, the Fantastic Four series and The Dark Knight trilogy (and in my humble opinion) The Dark Knight were all inspired in some way by JKR's story.|0
"Jessica Bohl plays Daphne , the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school . Daphne 's parents don't understand . . . . . and neither, it seems, does Daphne herself. In the final scene, Daphne stands on the top of a skyscraper waiting for her mother to appear on a platform. Daphne doesn't want her to see her . . . . . She wants to say, ""Mommy's dead."" A:

I believe she does say it. She doesn't say ""dead."""|0
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen well over 300 movies in my life. But , this one really gets me down . There is something about it , that seems to take away a lot of joy that I had in my youth. It is like a very bad joke , and I do not mean that as sarcastically as a joke. I really do not get what it is trying to say . The characters are so one dimensional , and when you look at how it was made , it was just plain wrong .|0
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. One definite plus is how it was filmed. Set in Morrocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion is filled with stirring images like the Great Raisuli on horseback especially. The cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal.|1
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from other films. The way that they did it is great though. The way they shot the fight scene at the end, where it seems like they were able to combine a lot of things from the movie and make it into one huge shot is something that they have not done in a lot of movies yet. All in all it has to be a good movie and I can see why people enjoy it. I can't wait to watch the director's cut.|0
Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one : he 's co-screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish sci-fi fantasy about the adventures of two young boys (Tom Hiddleston and Harry Potter) who are sent to live on Mars. The boys travel back and forth across the planet , exploring strange and sometimes dangerous worlds. They are both very young when this movie began to be conceived , and the film opens with them being sent off to Mars , at the tender age of 5, to live and adventure on the Red Planet , where nothing is ever the same.|0
"Like another poster mentioned Ch . 56 ( a local Boston TV station ) showed this multiple times over the weekend, and the local CBS news also showed it on the front page on Monday ( the front page, not the inside page)

Now, I don't watch the CBS news much at all. But that's just a matter of choice, and I'm pretty sure they'll still show it to me. But if I want to find out what actually happened, I'm just going to look it up online, like the poster said."|0
Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy , insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous ; at least when they get too close to him. And yet there is such a serenity and intelligence behind Faheyís performance that we never question the humanity of his fellow man or question whether he is evil. You might not have seen much of him lately, but Fahey came on the big screen last year in “The Descendants”, a drama based on the novel by Madeleine Lâ€™Engle about the relationship between a father and a young girl.|0
This movie is funny in more ways than one . It 's got action . It 's got humour . And it has some great lines . It 's an endearingly endearing movie . And it 's not too long . It 's also worth seeing for the story . You'll probably see all four of them in it . And, if you don't , don't worry . There are plenty of other '80s movies that are just as enjoyable . And, even better, they're free on this DVD . Enjoy the film and come again soon , or as often as you like .|0
"OK, when I say ""wow,"" I mean, ""Jesus, please help me."" I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. WATCH OUT!!! And by that, I mean watch out for those special effects. There is an amazing number of mistakes. The acting is terrible, but I'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the Sheriff."|1
Great book , poorly done movie . Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest . Flat storyline and weak characters do little to compensate . As far as I am concerned this movie is one of the lesser movies of 2000. The acting is atrocious and the film is a total mess. I do not think I will be going back to this film ever . I saw this movie in a theater as a matter of fact when I was a kid. I liked it . So if you like this movie , don't go see this crap .|0
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag on and on.|1
This film is replete with sentimentality , unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe , and irrelevant material. I am glad that this is making it to the screens of people who will appreciate the humor. I have watched this and the movie is indeed good. However, it did not end on a good note. Now we get to see who was behind this attack. I wonder how far they would go with this story. It's just a matter of time. It will be funny to watch them fight over whose story will be told.|0
Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. It was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later.|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity.|1
Stealing is a crime , and these guys , Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get into serious trouble at the end of the day. You have to give them points for effort. They stole a few of my favorite songs, but in my opinion it is a crime in itself. When you have an opportunity to steal something from someone or steal from someone or steal from yourself, don't do it. I am not going to name names but in my book you don't steal things you need, like toilet paper or coffee or whatever.|0
In the twilight years of his career , Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors , most notably J. Lee Thompson . The actor starred in four films released between 1968 and 1976 as the title character – two of which he also produced. In these collaborations, Bronson worked as both producer and actor. While Thompson’s work is well-known, he was only the first director Bronson worked with with. Bronson began working with Thompson on the first draft of The Wild Geese (1967). He then hired Thompson as director for The Brides of Versailles (1968) and The Dirty Dozen (1968).|0
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him.|1
So , it 's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie ... all you want is something that has some action so you go and search the internet for a movie that is about a man who meets a woman who turns into an alien. You know what 's the best part about that is that there are a lot of great movies like that but not all the movies that you can find have all that you are looking for. Well it 's not always a problem if it doesn 't have all that you want it to but sometimes you want to watch something with a little more action.|0
"Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the ""Female Scorpion"" series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. ""Beast Stable"" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before, or after, has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes and filming styles."|1
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks were perpetrating upon me and the rest of the world by presenting me with “Rise of the Planet of the Apes”, I suddenly heard my name. I’m not sure whether the voice behind me was actually my own or not, but the voice was very clear, and I could feel his eyes boring into the back of my head, and then, I heard him whisper to himself, “That’s it.|0
I 'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that poor person. The film was made in the 70’s, the story was about a little girl who had to move from her village to a town where there were people from a rich family. The mother of the little girl would not accept her as a child of her own, and would not allow her to live in the same house as her. The mother even tried to kill her, with an overdose.|0
Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing.|1
"It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no ""Look at me Kimmy!"""|1
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US.Anyway, this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy...)Why: Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. (Examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends.|1
"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt""."|1
This one's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words, but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen! I tell you I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of Physics and such (at which I've never been any good, in spite of my love of sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter anyway!|1
I have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. It is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. I totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. I think it is a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I have shown it to simply loves it. It is too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success.|1
"In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited ""peekaboo"" hairstyle. She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring screen successes in films like ""This Gun For Hire"" and ""I Married A Witch"". She held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in ""So Proudly We Hail"". But changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over."|1
Frederick Forsyth 's books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise at the ending. And sometimes I think that the author of the book does the twist , so I could have it done differently , and I could have changed the story entirely , and made it not have the twists and turns . I do not understand why that is a crime , it is not a crime to try and write the story the way it came to you in your head . If you write your story down , it would be easier to rewrite your story .|0
"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as ""the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times"" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is in there too."|1
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie ( keeping it kid friendly ) FX was a major let down at all. I'm sorry but i can not believe you would allow such a movie to go forward with no FX at all. Even the opening scene should have been at least some FX. I hope the director of this movie will get fired for the horrible mess he made. I thought this was a wonderful movie. It had a great plot and was really entertaining. I wish you guys would take the time to actually go into detail of the movie's plot.|0
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess , horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal 's latest works , both in its plot and its style. There is no real story line to be found here . We are only led from scene to scene , and from one subplot to another , as Seagal films , with his over the shoulder camera , the viewer is expected to follow along, as the story moves along at a snails pace . Wesley Snipes ' film 's style is as over the shoulder as the over the shoulder camera .|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (Mahler's 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent fan of Bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in ""The Servant"" however). Note: I recommmend multiple viewings."|1
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy.They're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex.|1
"I loved this movie when it first came out ( but i was just 12 years old then - and i can't say it's very good - so i can't really see why i should even care ) but i haven't watched it in a long time - now i just got rid of it , so i can watch it again :)

I'm a little late with this review as i didn't post it right away. But I'll post my thoughts on the movie and why i loved it. This was my favorite Disney movie ever made."|0
at the story. It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in New England. Her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road.|1
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around) a heroin addict really is. Good movie, which will never truly be outdated. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE'S world can become. Worth a look--an education of sorts. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in.|1
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly ! ! I related to the character Ann August more than most of the ones I've seen on TV or films. I did think that Ann was a bit too young though, but she made up her own mind about things and I guess it wasn't really her's to change . . . as the saying goes! I do have to say I felt for Ann a little because she's a teen in a teen's world (or maybe teen in a mature woman's world) and she feels like a kid in a candy shop.|0
This movie is an abortive , stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad blockbuster. There are no good movies in this mess, but there are plenty of bad ones, some of which could have been interesting, had the director(s) not abandoned them. It all started on a cold and wet Friday, when we all decided to go to a matinee. I had no idea why we were going to the movies. I had never seen this movie in a matinee before, and it seemed a little silly.|0
This is by far my favorite action movie . But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin character , though he's an awesome character . What keeps it fresh and alive is the plot . That is a very unusual way to make a film and I would like to know what are the advantages of doing this way . I also recommend to watch it along with its predecessor . I think you will notice that it does not have the same pace and energy . Also the action is more realistic and brutal . So it is easier to like this one .|0
"Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful ! ! This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name. This movie has nothing to offer anyone. Not even a plot. The plot is like the plot from an 80-year-old comic book. But it still has some nice scenes. Like the one that is in the middle of the movie, when the three of them are sitting there talking. The conversation is cool. They talk about this and that. This and that and that...
And then there is the sex scene, which is just a little too graphic and disgusting."|0
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not ""relevant"", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely ""A Good Thing"" as Martha Stewart(appropriately)would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this film and Dennis Morgan perfectly compliments her. Both of them have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z."|1
"One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films, ""Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - American people trying to sound Scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others).Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle."|1
Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it 's beyond funny . The `` plot '' is about an American mercenary , played by William Hurt , who travels to Colombia with the intent on killing one of the many drug barons in the area . He is joined by a beautiful woman ( Meryl Streep ) who is very much into the dark side of the law . The problem ? The men can't seem to stay away from each other . It doesn't help matters that William Hurt is not particularly likable , and there is no shortage of ugly things to be said about Meryl Streep .|0
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock 's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director , pairing Carole Lombard with Cary Grant. In The Lady Vanishes, the title refers not only to a young actress in the title role, but to Lombard's character , who's a bit like Lombard herself. She's a woman who takes a job on the road to meet her wealthy, but somewhat absent, husband, who's on the road with his mistress. The journey turns tragic when he meets a young woman (Grant), whom he doesn't recognize, and then disappears in a train crash.|0
Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clichéd cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. Tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not Buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave. 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible film. It rips off so many other films (can you say Blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. The script is non existent.|1
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. I realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. Beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart rack...You know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget.|1
"So keira knightly is in it ... So automatically we compare this film to attonement . Aside rom the fact that there are similarities to the both movies , the film is in fact a sequel of an old movie . I will give it a four stars . So the story is pretty much similar with the movie . I will tell you the whole story in the end . So lets get on to it















The hero of this movie who is played by nikhil . So the story is pretty much the same that nikhil plays in attonement . So the film was made by same director and producer ."|0
One of the best , Lackawanna BluesGreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those movies that I had a tough time getting to watch. However, the movie definitely had me going from the time it was over, so it was a good movie to go see. This movie is a bit slow at times, but it does get to the point. It does a good job at telling an interesting story and leaving a good message at the end. It is hard to rate this movie unless you are a fan of the Blues.|0
`` The Journey '' is a very good film . Produced in the spring of 1958 , in Vienna , it took five years in the making. The story is about an American writer, David Riesman, who moves to Israel in 1957. In Israel , he is able to explore the impact of religion and politics on the way people live and think. Riesman makes his living as a social historian and writer of historical essays. In the film, he is trying to make sense of a revolution taking place in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem.|0

Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series , published in 1981, that this is a true history of the “dark side of Britain”. The BBC made a mistake, one which it now acknowledges, in the 1980 mini-series . It’s too late now to correct it, because, as I’m sure anyone with an understanding of how to use the Internet will be aware, it’s been done. But I will make a suggestion, which anyone who is familiar with the BBC should be able to spot without too much difficulty.|0
I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out . Just one more reason to stay at home (and cook my food). I am glad I finally tried this out. While it doesn't taste like asparagus soup with noodles (I tried that) or any other soups, it does have a good amount of asparagus. It is easy to make as you just need two ingredients . A pot and asparagus (I used a 16 oz. pot, so I added the water, added the asparagus and brought it to a boil).|0
This movie is not the scariest of all time , but it is a great example of a campy eighties monster movie that will leave a lasting impression in the mind of any monster movie fan. You know, the ones who never want to watch a straight horror movie ever again. In this movie we have a horror icon as the main villain, an alien monster, a giant, a giant robot, and in the end, a bunch of other monsters trying to kill the heroes of the movie... This movie has been on my list for years.|0
"This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realise it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK), but this was awful. The family were so cheesy, ""Love you mum"" ""Love you even more honey"" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, ""Love you mum"" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home."|1
Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of that.So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission.|1
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+ . Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely have a low self-esteem, a low-self esteem will lead to a more ghettoish or lower self esteem person, a ghettoish person who can’t compete in society and a low self esteem will not want to take a part in society. There is a certain type of people who want to be accepted, have their own life and live in an ordinary life. Some of the cartoon shows will have this type of people, some cartoon shows don’t have.|0
"Oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of ""worst 80's slasher ever made"". ""The Prey"" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!)."|1
Okay ... for the most part , and all its cheesiness , this movie was actually pretty good for an adaptation from a manga . There are a few times where the animation gets a little silly, but overall , you can't complain here . I would actually give this series a 6/10, but I have a few minor complaints . The animation is a lot more colorful than it actually is , and a couple times in the movie I noticed it was being animated in 2D , but it wasn't too noticeable . The fights are pretty good , especially the ones where the villains actually show up in their own movies .|0
This is definitely a touching movie , and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle . The movie is set in the 60s , and is very true to that period. The movie is well written and produced , with a great cast . It is a very personal movie . The movie also has great music from the 60s era . The movie did not really need the 3D , as you can see most scenes with the naked eye , or with a normal 3D glasses . The 3d effect was added as an added bonus. The movie is well worth the money .|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. It also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films.|1
Unlike one of the reviewers below, I don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. Whereas it is good to see a British director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex.|1
Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs.|1
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote.|1
I have watched two episodes so far , I really like it . Even though I am no longer in my teens , it has reminded me of being in my teen years . I must say it is not really scary , it was very relaxing , I did not think that this show would make you feel good . You have to watch it for that . But after watching it I am still thinking that it will be better if I was in my teens when I was watching . But if you can watch this show in your teens , it might have a better effect on you .|0
Although i watched this film by myself ( thankfully ) , i still felt embarrassed while watching it . I mean how could a normal person feel embarrassed to watch this , right ? And how could anyone not feel happy while watching this ? There are many good moments in this film but i would say the most memorable scenes are where the two lead actors played the role of a brother and his younger brother in the film . Both of these brothers were the best character actors that i have seen . In one scene they had a big fight while both were holding a sword and their fight was very violent .|0
This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco . It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners , a life of struggle against poverty and illness . In the film this is the story of the people of Campos dos Goytacazes , which lives in a small town in Pernambuco, Brazil. This is an amazing story about a poor Brazilian family, a family without parents and it’s members who live from day to day living with their grandparents , who have been their parents and take care of them. This film is based on a true story.|0
"For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie , another payday in L.A. For their efforts , the movie made $14 million at the box-office and is already getting rave reviews, including a 100% ""fresh"" rating at Rotten Tomatoes . The movie opens in theaters nationwide on March 25, but there are a few locations in the Bay Area where the movie could play at noon on March 26 (in Santa Clara, for one, and the Castro) and again at 4 p.m. the same day (in San Jose)."|0
In my opinion , the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing . The initial idea of having someone to take care of me was a brilliant one and I was really happy to see the end of it . I do not know how they could have gotten it all out and done in under 30 hours . I just know I was extremely happy to have had that much time to myself . But after reading this book , i am left in tears . To begin , I had high hopes for this story , since it was the first story in a series that I've read in many moons now .|0
"Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterion's ""Monsters & Madmen"" set), director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!"|1
"Having endured this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end. Throughout the film I felt that I was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and taut, camera work appalling, and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local High School ""Amateur Dramatic's Society"".The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in its credits, other than that it was pure dribble."|1
This was Gene Kelly 's breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable . Throw in Rita Hayworth as his muse and he had it made . For the rest of us , he did his best to outdo himself and the audience roared with laughter . It is hard to think of him as anything but a genius , even today . Gene Kelly , who made his first appearance in the Broadway musical Cabaret , in 1947 , was a brilliant performer and a gifted stage manager . He went on to make an enormous contribution to the world of film , stage , radio and television .|0
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat , this is the type of person who I thought could have influenced my work. There is something about him that I really wanted to emulate. When I was in high school, my friend told me about an artist, Andy Warhol, and asked if I would help him paint his paintings. Since I had never heard of Warhol, I thought he would be difficult, but he showed me his paintings. I admired his style, and I had a great time trying to replicate it on paper.|0
Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody , I have to hear 10 minutes of people making fun of it? The movie's not that bad, I don't find it completely unbelievable, I just don't understand why so many people find it stupid and unfunny. That's not to say that it's the worst thing you've ever seen or thought of, and I'm sure there's many, many worse. It's just that there are some situations that just cannot be handled in a movie, and this is one of those moments.|0
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.I'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin.|1
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins . The premise is that the nation 's dissidents ( hippies, punks, anarchists etc) were beaten, starved, beaten up, locked up, raped and otherwise mistreated by the cops. The filmmakers claim to be making a truthful documentary, but when you consider how the police treated the punks who attacked the police in the 70s ( and still do) you can understand why this makes the movie seem like something out of a Quentin Tarantino script . The film was released as a 'feature' in the US, so it did not have a distributor in Britain.|0
I 've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre . Some movies have a cast of thousands and others have a cast that plays to a cast of 200. In this movie there are only three actors that play all the three roles in the movie. The movie was released in the year of 1997 and it was the best ever. The film was a very touching and a very heartwrenching movie. There were so many twists, turns and surprises in it that kept the viewer guessing what was going to happen next.|0
It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial `` wake-up call '' . And , when it happens, we like to offer a few words of encouragement and advice . So we decided to do the same for one of our own. So what did Mr. Jay Leno have in common with his predecessor ? The answer is as simple as the message is long. All that he had in common with Jack Lord was that Jack Lord used his celebrity to help people, and Jay Leno used his own celebrity to make money.|0
"I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% top notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep ""FOREVER!"""|1
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent.|1
i watched it because my friend said we could try it , when my father asked if we 'd watch the same thing, i said i would like to try , but my sister said i couldn't because it was for a friend , then my dad went and made sure i was watching it so my sister and i could try it , when he said it , we both said ok . i don't know if you guys knew, but my family doesn't really have much money, and we're pretty poor .|0
SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! ! This was my son 's review of the movie , which he wanted me to tell you, just in case you don't know him yet. He said he loved it. I don't know how many of my readers have seen it. You would be amazed at how many people have not seen this movie and don't know it's existence. So I'm including the review in case it's helpful to your understanding. This is the kind of movie that you could watch many times and learn many things about yourself and about human nature, as well.|0
I rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. Fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). Wondering if the fast forward function on your VCR works?|1
"This movie has to be the worst film I have seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004. HELLO. ""Lord of the Rings"" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to Film and TV school."|1
Imagine every stereotypical , overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1945: the tough, hard-partying, working-class gangster who's become a legend. In fact, these characters have always been here, but in our imagination they're always from another time and place entirely. But the gangsters of the New York Police Department (NYPD) weren't your average gangsters, or even ordinary cops. Most of them came from outside the city. They were outsiders—outsiders from Brooklyn, outsiders from New Jersey—who worked their way into the department and became part of the very fabric of our city.|0
"Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with ""real live"" native dancers. It's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). Throughout the film, Emanuelle is going after every man she meets."|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time, I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. This is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.This show sucks.Its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous.|1
"Jerk hazer Mike(David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam(Caleb Roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. They get PO'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty(Kristina Sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."|1
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people I know.Great moments between characters  including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. Beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.When watching any film with Maori actors, I've found that I can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life.|1
"The director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: ""Amélie"" meets ""Breaking the waves"" meets ""Pauline at the beach"". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold."|1
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen year old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.|1
I 've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute best. It's one of those films that really does it for you. In some respects, it's really simple - but it's the simplicity that makes it amazing. And in the best possible way - there are just a few simple scenes and moments that make everything else in the film so memorable. I can't say that I have a favorite scene - but I don't hate any of the scenes - as I like everything I watch - so there's that to consider.|0
Yes , why ? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80 's and 90 's Gus Van Sant was a big influence on me . In the 90 ' s I began to look at the world and see it through the eyes of a 13 year-old . Now I have the power to see the world through the eyes of an adult . There are many movies I would like to revisit and make another movie but the ones that I think are important are the ones that show how things work on the ground . Not how people think they work on the ground .|0

WARNING : PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . Fans of his earlier films will be left wondering why he decided to make a horror film with his latest project . But for those who love his films like I do and have followed his work since his start in the movie business , he does a superb job. The story revolves around a single mother, Alice ( Elizabeth Perkins) who lives alone with her son in her apartment. Alice has been widowed for quite some time and now lives with a new girlfriend in a seedy area of the city.|0
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley).Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children.|1
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. There is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. Our actress are treated like pieces of ass, and seem to be perfectly happy with their position. The lead characters, these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.|1
It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. The dialog was unnatural. Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense just wasn't there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen.|1
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year 's Cannibal Ferox . The characters are universally repulsive and have no redeeming features. We get to know each of them in detail, and we're never sure how we're supposed to sympathize. It's a terrible movie and its makers deserve no more credit than anyone else for trying something different. The film, made in 2002 by the New Zealand company Mad Dog Films, was based on a novel by Jack London. That's all well and good in principle. But that doesn't give the film the right to be considered an American classic.|0
I do n't leave IMDb comments about films but this .... this film was bad . very bad . I mean it did not have to be this bad and I can understand people not liking it at the same time but it was bad. The plot is very simple. It has nothing to do with the plot. It does not matter what happens if you're watching the film, it's just boring and it makes no sense. What's interesting is that this film had a very unique story. For a long time people were talking about this film but never realized what they were talking about.|0
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals . One of the worst movie that i ever saw , but it was pretty interesting. The story starts with a small town boy who is very poor. He wants to be rich, but his father wants him to be a normal boy like the rest of the town. When the boy’s father gets a bad disease the boy decides to use his father’s illness as an excuse to become rich . He becomes sick, and is given a treatment by an evil doctor to cure his sickness.|0
After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan , a metal object in it 's brain is analysed , and it was decided they had a brain tumour and the rest of the mummies got a free brain scan. They then decided that it was an alien and took the mummy down to the hospital and gave the mummy scans. It was then that i decided to go and find out what the scans meant. The scan showed that there was something inside the mummy's head , but what it was was a little bit of metal that wasn't shown in the photo of the mummy and the scans .|0
A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The sounds,courtesy of Japanese band 'Dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. It's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. All in all, they worked everything out perfectly....Well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted.|1
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched . It makes Mel Gibson seem like a real person. I don't know how else to say it . I just think it's an awesome piece of filmmaking . I love it . And that's the first of many times that I have watched that movie, with the exception being watching the first few minutes of Terminator 2. It's not that it makes Mel Gibson seem like ""a real person"", he just makes Gibson seem like a person."|0
If you have n't read Tolkien 's masterpiece ; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever ! If you're like me, it will make you cry or shake your head ! As I watched the opening of The Lord of the Rings , in the late 1990s, I found myself completely unprepared for what I was about to witness. Though Tolkien is a master of storytelling , he does have a very different approach to it than we are familiar with. For me , it made it more difficult than I thought it would be. I grew up reading Tolkien's stories.|0
I loved this show . Such talent ; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only one season , and with less than 10 episodes . That is a shame . What an epic show. This will be my all time favorite season. I loved this show. The actors were so great. I watched every episode. I was sad when I learned that this show would be ending, but I knew that there was a season 2 and a 3 waiting for me. It is so hard to believe they are going to end it, after only one season.|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title ""The Broken Skull."" Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, ""Evil Dead"" kind of way.Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying ""hunh?"|1
This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been out on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery (the movie, although taking place in and around Virginia, was filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie (including a boat that I've worked on).|1
**Might contain spoilers**Ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think that? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved.|1
Dear reader, Watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. If you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. However, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an American audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons.|1
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward.|1
"Most movies I can sit through easily , even if I do not particularly like the movie . I am not one of those who is always ready to say "" I am glad I see this movie , it was good "". But when something grabs me in the middle of a movie , it can be hard not to say that , especially for a movie which is not one that I have seen . I have seen movies that I hated , but in those movies , I always thought it would be better if I could sit through the movie , because at least , it was not that bad ."|0
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allen Poe, James Herbert, and Stephen King, among other authors. The story was written by the American horror film director James Wan, and it's directed by the Canadian horror filmmaker M.C. Gaines, who was also in the writing and directing team of the original Saw film that was released in 2005 and earned him a Saturn Award for Best Director, a Golden Rasp Award for Best Original Screenplay, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Screenplay.|0
Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love-fest for the murderer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The Execution of Wanda Jean, with it's completely one sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. It tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. She seemed uneducated, but so did her entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded.|1
"I used to think that it couldn't get worse that ""Army of the Dead"" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like ""The Godfather""!! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes the acting, put it this way, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, when compared to these D-List (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses."|1
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. It was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp.|1

"Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend "" Uncle"" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas."|1
"I ca n't believe I even tried to watch this filth . As an avid B-Horror movie fan , I have a lot of favorites. The first time I saw it ,I was pretty sure I had to have it , but it never happened , so I had to go to the DVD and rent it . I watched it a couple of different times , and it never seemed to get any better , I still don't understand why it didn't just get remade in 3D , but I'll let you find out for yourself ! This is definitely a ""classic"" horror film ."|0
As kids movie it is great . For the family it just sucks . I was truly hoping for something like this and it did not happen . It is a shame because they do not need the money they just had to have it . I was very much hoping for a film that is a little different . That is a shame for the family and people who like to spend money for a movie like this . What a ripoff! You should watch it with your children. They will see the potential in this story and you will find out they are better than you at it!|0
Badly shot , badly edited , clumsy dialogue , flat characters , unsuccessful adaption of a novel . It does not hold up on its own , and it would not have held up on its own were it not for its high concept premise. In the hands of someone who understood it, it is a brilliant satire . Unfortunately, this is the type of thing that happens in Hollywood and is too common nowadays to shock the masses . It takes a brave writer to do something like this. And it takes an even worse director to go with it.|0
I do n't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV , i was young and i saw it when it came out.It was a very dark film,but with some interesting ideas.I can't recommend it highly enough! I did not like it, and I'm ashamed to say that this was the first film I watched.I watched it on TV and was so impressed I had to rent it and then saw it in the theater and was so shocked I couldn't sit through it. I left early.|0
"Well,this movie is really ""PLUMPED"" HAHA Get it? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if ""PLUMP"" (haha)! is really unbelievable.The storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. It did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. I mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh."|1
2001: A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things.|1
"This was absolutely one of the best movies I 've seen . Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will bring tears of joy to most of them . This movie will make many happy people . This movie has the potential to change your view on life . There is nothing else you could ask for that would make your life better . The movie also have its share of issues . ""One day I saw him. He was there all the time; and he would never leave me . . . The only light in a world that was all dark; a light I could not see."|0
I watched 40 minutes and could n't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to the living room, where I found the family in deep discussion. It is the best television show of the season so far  or maybe ever. I love the characters  the kids, the mom and dad, the little brother and sister. And there has been much good writing  it is not just dialogue. The characters have been written in the most natural way  I didn't feel that was forced writing. I don't even mind the sex, it's natural and real.|0
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons.Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson.Acting wise everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller.|1
"...now please move on because that's getting on my nerves.Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""To Die For"" (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake) started an experimental phase with ""Gerry"", which reached its peak with the thought-provoking ""Elephant"". ""Last Days"" had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while ""Paranoid Park"", his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else."|1
Oh dear ! What can I say about Half Past Dead ? I was really disappointed in it . I thought the plot was really weak and unoriginal . I was a little confused on what exactly was going on . The ending was good but was anticlimactic . I don't think the acting was great . I don't think the songs were great . It just wasn't a very good movie for me. I just don't know what to say . It just didn't work for me . I thought it had some potential and could have become a great movie .|0
A MUST SEE documentary. -- -- -This movie had so many things to consider while watching it . It was very interesting. -- -- -It shows how different cultures have treated women in different ways. They all have good points and also many of them had flaws. The women in the movie are given equal roles to play, and they all have different styles. It was an interesting watch. -- -- -If you watch the movie you will realize how important it is. -- -- -- -This movie is an eye-opener for people who are not familiar with history, women and culture of women.|0
`` Ahh ... I did n't order no amazing hit show '' ..... '' We 'll you got one '' I did!'' '' No I did!'' How about that!'' You've got one!'' But I didn't do it, did I?'' But it's not what you think, I swear!'' What I want to know is did I?'' Well, of course I did!'' Yes I did!'' Why else would you tell me?'' No, no!'' No no, I did not order a hit show!''|0
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome , 'Caligula ' is not made in the style of a classic Roman play , and there is not the slightest suggestion in the dialogue or the actions that he (or they) have read anything of Plautus , nor indeed that he has heard of Seneca 's Discourses or of Plautus himself. Nor has he seen anything of the plays of Shakespeare. But he is a man who has learnt to think and act and speak in accordance with the traditions of the past.|0
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich , and the setting unusual and interesting . But the central character was a very weak one. We were told that his past was tragic and his present had not changed much. He is a simpleton who has no idea what he wants. In fact, when his past comes back into focus , it has not changed much, and is more of an excuse for not being able to do anything constructive with his life. This is what the author is trying to create with him , and we are supposed to buy into it .|0
"To tell you the truth , I do not speak Tamil , and I did not understand the film . So I would like to hear it in Malayalam , with Malayalam subtitles :)

The movie is really interesting. It has good content and the actors are well cast. I loved how they have made this film in a short span. It looks good and was made in a very good manner . I love these kind of movies , it is a very rare type to see them . I think we should see it all over the place ."|0
One of Bolls better attempts . Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just as much as you did from the beginning , it just takes more time , and more effort to get there , and more money , or whatever , so if it takes longer it just shows that the problem is more complicated , and needs more time to get fixed . I don't think any one of those are the root of the problem. The root of the problem is the people that bought the idea that you can buy your way out of debt.|0
Gracie ( Minnie Driver ) , a woman in her late twenties , is on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. When her wait gets longer than she could bear she is forced to make tough decisions. Will she give up her life in New York to be with a man who may never love her and who has lost his wife ? Will she decide to live in the small apartment she has been given in an inner city Chicago neighborhood where the streets are not always safe and where she is not sure whether or not she really wants to become a nurse?|0
It's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. The paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly came to know it, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. I've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways.|1
"Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone . Even if he hadn ' t directed the most famous and beloved movie in history there would always be the question, ""What would he do next?"" It was no surprise to anyone who knew him. But what a way to go. Wellman died just two weeks before the first of his two-hour documentary ""A Prairie Home Companion"" is released. In his short life Wellman was loved by many for many different reasons, but most of all because he loved."|0
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. Think of that conman's conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic.|1
"Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. Not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious (""movie horror helps us deal with real horror"", ""you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre"") and pretty trite. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring."|1
"""Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of ""nanny""."|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
"Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. Some scenes are not ""nice"" or ""beautiful"", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what's happening here. The camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst."|1
"Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it 's best . This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is a treat for fans of great '80s and '70s comedy. In addition to the original sketches, you'll get an extra-special bonus set of jokes that will make your head explode. You'll laugh so hard you'll think you've wet yourself. You're welcome. You can laugh it up. -

The original set of jokes here will blow your mind

-

There are more than 30 minutes of funny comedy here. There is more than one way to skin a cat!"|0
No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original.|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load on my mind. It seems like it will be a very long movie. The acting is pretty good, but the story line seems way off. You can see how the story is not true. I would give it 4 stars. I am giving this 4 stars. There is one thing that is important. This was the only movie at the theater with a popcorn box. This is one of the most interesting films that we have seen in a long time.|0
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is ! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that’s boring and unfocussed just doesn’t cut the mustard for a horror film. And then there’s the score. There’s only one way to say it. It is boring. If you’re reading this, I’m pretty sure you know exactly where I’m coming from. And so what’s a horror fan without a soundtrack? Well, we got it. You see, the soundtrack of The Descent was released as the B-Side of the album.|0
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's angst ridden self portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish.|1
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. A sick film that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money, any money at all. If anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! Your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. I beg of you, DON'T!|1
"This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be ""A Sandra Bullock Movie"". She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere..."|1
Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin? The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I don't know a power plant nearby, some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two.|1
A brash, self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a role obviously tailor-made for him, William Haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. A grade-A scene stealer, Haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents.|1
"With its rerelease by ADV Films, I've had a chance to watch ""The Giant Majin"" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!The sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant Majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!"|1
"Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Shall I go on? There is one, I repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing Amateur Hour Special of a film: Fares Fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking Swedish ""actors"" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning."|1
"One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and Judgement Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.Actually, good candidates for a real Third Testament have been published several times - like ""A Course in Miracles"" or ""Conversations with God""."|1
This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ' and 'Garden State ' not because of content but because of the chemistry between these actors and the way they portrayed these characters. And the fact it was a success is thanks to great actors, the great story, and a great director that knows how to get actors to connect. This film has its pros and cons, but overall a very successful and fun movie. I enjoyed it very much and I'm very curious to see the next one, and also I would recommend it to my friends.|0
"This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the ""good"" sister is just silly. It is Anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not Mary's, that has been told so often.In response to an earlier review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so ""criminal""... to me it's Henry who was the real criminal."|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I’m no expert, I think I know the basics. I think I can explain. I don’t think that there is any need for an introduction. They have already met. They have talked and shared memories. I think the main reason they met was to see if he would be interested in taking on the role of Doctor Who. I think that that is how they know to have met. They have talked. They have sat together.|0
Hilary was great as julie , and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi , but there should have been more of you in the play to keep things moving forward and keep things lively. This play is a good play, but there are far too many plot devices and far too many characters for just one play. Overall, I enjoyed this play, it was a good and interesting play that kept me engaged to its end. It had a good beginning, middle, and an end to make it a good play that kept my interest throughout.|0
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani 's Man Push Cart , and this film is equally good . This slice of life comedy centers on a family where each member struggles to put the family business aside for a moment to enjoy a life of love and laughter . This film has its moments , and while most of the time it is amusing , there are a few stretches where the comedy falls flat because of poor scripting . For instance , one moment in the movie where Rami and Giorgia are arguing over who has to buy a new vacuum cleaner for their family business is one of those moments .|0
Fortunately , I have n't seen this film in a movie , big screen , just on a small screen or small tv , but still the movie is great to me . no matter what the size of the screen we have to put on the picture , to have the effect to make us think , and see the story . it is so great , a movie for everybody , and you will be amazed what you have to do . now i have seen many movies , but still this is the very best , my favorite movie in the whole history .|0
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides . Then again , are these really suicides? Or is there something much more sinister to these deaths that go unrevealed . The answers lie in a little town in Illinois that has seen a rise in suicides and mysterious deaths for over a month . And with the recent death of an influential local family, things are getting worse . When the bodies of two women are found and autopsied , authorities are shocked to discover that one had died of a self-inflicted death and another had committed suicide.|0
"This is the best work i have ever seen on television . The story is compelling -- all the more so because it is so hard to take seriously. However, it's also not so hard to believe. I found myself thinking, ""Of course this is real."" And yet, as with many of us here at The Moth, the more I think about the whole thing the more incredulous I am. There are some things in this that are just plain not credible, but, at the same time, most of the details are not in dispute."|0
Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad things are:1. It's very slow. 2. How Ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of Asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home.|1
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.While I speak German as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience... So therefore, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are only done by 4 voices!|1
It 's 2005 , my friends ... a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology . So it seems only natural that you'll be going to see an amazing time-lapse film of New York City . You're probably going to be amazed at how well this film does what it sets out to achieve. You'll notice how much it captures the atmosphere in the city . You've come to see what it was like in the mid-twentieth century . And by that , of course , I mean the era of the film, not the century .|0
"I unwittingly walked into this `` trap '' of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a refund, I know I would do so. But I can only hope that no one else saw it. If it was so awful, why would they waste their time? The movie is not awful, but it is just bad. There are some fine performances. However, much of it is filled with what I like to call plot holes. First, we are introduced to the ""hero"" who saves the day at the expense of losing a leg."|0
Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema, I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean movies under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize.|1
Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke . He might , as he himself has said, have been better than me . But that is all right . I know I have my weaknesses and that is the best way to overcome them . I have a good life as a writer. I know that my readers would not have been satisfied if the book was only half good , half bad . So I take the best of each part and then put it all together. That is what you should do too .|0
Get the CD instead . The show is tame , and the editing sucks . The crowd gets way too involved in the comedy . That is the reason I bought it . Not for the music or the sound . But because of the talent . That show would make you want to have a career in stand up . Just for the talent , and the comedy . Dude, how the hell are you gonna get the people who are trying to find this concert on their home computer from your home computer? You must have the whole thing recorded somewhere.|0
Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact, I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death.|1
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes.|1
"I think ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most overrated horror film out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well-directed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like ""Gone With the Wind""!I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby Andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is)."|1
"Not as bad as ""Billy Bathgate"" but close. Try as he might, Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. The other actors don't fare as well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft."|1
"I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting, and thought ""hmm, can't be too bad."" Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was ""not too good"".Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."|1
I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible! I expected it to be great, because you know, usually we don't have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off, you really don't have anything useful at all! The director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example.|1
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art.|1
"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the ""rest of the world"". Story based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during WWII was the prisoner of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps. Borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter Tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. He describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation."|1
When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat.|1
I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off.|1
"Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now, her book ""Breaking Dawn"" will not be first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans.Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it.She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times, she even acted like she had PTSD."|1
What I got was something better.Just like many movies I 've commented on as of recently , I 'd been in a situation like this before. There was a moment of clarity, or maybe just an epiphany, and I decided what I wanted out of life and my relationship with her. I 'm not going to go into detail here, but what I will share is what I found and how I changed my life to be in the best interest of our relationship. It's very important that I tell you because there are some people out there that would be upset with me if I didn't.|0
A very , very , very slow-moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man . Not sure how I feel about it being called “a movie about a troubled man “, but it does get to the point that I find myself doing a bit of internal “cheating” to avoid the feeling that the movie is boring me . I mean, if I’m trying hard not to notice anything , then why would I notice it ? I mean , if it’s boring me , then it must be something that I don’t want too much .|0
I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations.|1
"""Prime Suspect 4"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal."|1
"This film makes several nods to various science fiction films . The prologue reminds me of the one for the film, Star Wars, that opened the film's first chapter, Return of the Jedi . Star Wars also features several references to this film, including in the prologue, when Han Solo makes reference to the ""Space Opera"" genre. . There is also a lot of other nods to the film in the film's script, such as at one point, there is a reference to an old book from one of the aliens that was a gift to Han during a meeting with him."|0
Visconti 's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made . While watching , we feel a bit of the same sorrow we felt when he was murdered. This film is set in Venice, Italy in the 15th century and was shot at the same time and in the same place as Piero di Cosimo 's (1563-1625) masterpiece The Lute Player. The movie has an interesting plot. It is about the tragic love story of two men who live in different social class, but they are both noble and rich, and both want a wife.|0
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes up short.------------ Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. However, the Wild Life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful (""I got Visa...Masterrrrr Charrrrge!!"")"|1
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show.I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she once again kicked butt. It was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys.|1
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young . Instead , I found out how to play golf and how to drive a Lamborghini . Now I want to go on an adventure to discover a new world . It will be a great time , I promise you .

Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect , specifically some of the acting . However I feel that there's something more to the film than just that. There's also the story and characters which I found very compelling. So overall, I think I'll be recommending this movie to anyone who is interested in this genre. What I liked:It's hard to know what to like about this movie. So much of it is a mess. I don't really want to nitpick about anything. But I will, and I will not.|0
"RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed, independent and stubborn. This isn't the first casting change the studio has had in the wake of the success of ""Jurassic World"" and its sequel, though RKO's recent moves have been more subtle than what you see here. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" -- RKO's most recent movie, set to open on Sept. 24 -- also had a bit of a shakeup in that its cast featured several actresses whose filmography contained little more than small-screen appearances."|0
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it . Something like : ``What we are trying to do with this film, is to show the world what a real hero is.`` I was really pleased with this, because I wanted to see if such a thing existed. After I had found such a hero, there came the problem of finding the film, and with it such a man . The film was the ``The Man of Bronze,'' and the hero was an Australian who had lived for many years in London.|0
I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD, particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, particularly at the finale.I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is just so so lame compared with the original. What where they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the finale?|1
(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction.|1
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, you'd thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good.|1
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as it should have been in our country.I had seen few Indian Movies but never saw the same quality like here in India. The music is great and the cast and crew was excellent.The movie is awesome and will stay with you for life. This Movie had the best acting by Vijay Sethupathi. He did a lot of things in this movie to impress the audience but that was his acting. His performance was not in Bollywood but that was ok with me.|0
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time . Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least . Energy was his trademark . The movie starts out well . It is not until the end of the film that the viewer sees that the movie starts out badly . The movie starts with a pretty decent story . This is the only good thing about this flick . The story begins with some good intentions . However, Spilsbury does not stick with it long enough to see what he wants to say . This is an extremely bad movie . The story and acting is completely horrible .|0
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios.|1
Rowan Atkinson 's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy , Buster Keaton , the Marx Brothers , and Buster Keaton . When I was at an early age, Mr. Bean was my idol . I thought he was my favorite character, but after watching him perform in Mr. Bean , I must admit , he's my favorite comedy character as well . So I'm very pleased to finally meet him . In Mr. Bean , Mr. Bean is an English gentleman who lives on the island of Hogsmeade . Every year on his birthday , he is visited by Santa Claus .|0
I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got . The acting was just awful for the majority of it, the writing was pretty bad, the direction was really bad, I really hated the film and would not recommend this to anyone . I felt that the only reason I bought this movie was to try and save my hard earned cash and that is exactly how I felt throughout the entire duration of the movie . I would have to say if you have the ability and money to do so do not waste your hard earned cash buying a movie of this caliber .|0
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination , like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights . There are only three things that made it worth watching , a couple of people in the audience and my brother-in-law who I can only assume watched it with the same intensity of interest as me. I know some people won’t agree with this assessment, but for me, a film that takes a serious stance on something is something worth recommending, no matter what the stance is, and that’s what I found myself enjoying about this film.|0
"THE OTHER is a supposed ""horror"" movie made during the 1970s. It is not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, which starred Nicole Kidman.The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as ""the game"". One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be ""good"". The other one - Holland - is supposed to be evil.The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel."|1
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January ( 2005 ) I did n't like it, it was not for everyone. In fact it wasn't even for me at that time. I was too young to remember the 80s in the way that it did back then, but I knew what was great and what wasn't at that time. That's why I didn't like it then. The story, the dialogue and the acting were terrible back then, I guess. I hated it.|0
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots , dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but its so well done it does not give the viewer time to become bored . The ending was very good and shocking at the same time , its very sad but at the same time the film leaves you wanting more . It was a very hard watching of the film with the constant sound effect and sounds in the room . The acting was brilliant in all departments . It's just too bad that director David Fincher doesn't seem to have a good sense of what makes an effective horror film.|0
This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen . Probably `` Okul '' is the best comedy ever made in the history of Turkish Cinema. I must say this is an excellent film for those who love Turkish Cinema. I recommend it to all and sundry , even to the foreigners who appreciate the best Turkish films. This movie is a must have for everyone, especially those who love Turkish Film. I love Turkey and I have been to Istanbul and seen many movies. This film is very interesting. This film is the best movie I have ever seen in the whole world.|0
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals , it 's a classic ! > Rita Hayworth is in top form , as usual, - she does a great Marilyn in her final years , her voice is incredible. > It's so easy to see how the movie would go, it's so funny! > The ending was the funniest thing ever I've seen on a movie screen , too funny! > I don't think I have seen any other movie like this one ! The music is amazing, it's great. The movie is great fun !|0
Let's get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards.|1
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. Alas, with TV movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap Cosmo questionnaire films. With a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better.|1
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster!|1
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.After every Lnych movie I tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.So, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it.|1

I've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. I feel it's a waste of time to even write this but I'll make it short. Why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurly directed and cut. 2. Bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clichés. 4. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. Bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6.|1
*****I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean.|1
"The main problems of 'Saw ' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just see and miss (I have the feeling that some of the mistakes that make the most impression to me are not really in the script as such, but are there simply to increase the effect, and not in the film itself). In fact it seems to me that there's a very close relationship between the mistakes that are made in the script, and what I call the ""plotting"" errors (the problems I found most frequently)."|0
For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ( `` like , why does he show so much , how does he know so much stuff ? ''), I can only say that this film was made in such a way that it took years to do a single scene. So what it was made was a time-lapse in the life of this one man's life. You have a film that runs for around 5 hours, and every time the scene ends it takes another 5 to go back to that point, so it starts again from scratch and ends up with a completely different life story.|0
Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema. Here is one good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to the producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who in reality, is the son of the producer of the film. Hence, he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so.|1
Formulaic to the max . Neither title reflects the serial 's actual content , `` Fighting Nazis in Morocco ,'', which ran from 1942 until 1943. The title's 's final words were deleted when the British censor objected to any reference to Nazism. In an early version of this essay, I expressed doubt about the very existence of Nazi collaborators. I based my doubts, and my skepticism, on research that is not yet in final shape. However, when I have time to write my analysis, I am sure I will come to a more definitive answer to that question.|0
When I first heard about `` Greek , '' I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous . And I thought I'd see if I could ever learn Greek , and see if it could make my life less boring . Well , I watched a lot of movies about Greek history and I'm glad I did , because it made me interested in learning the language , and eventually, helped me learn enough Greek to make my life more interesting . But after watching it , you'd never guess I knew anything about Greek . In a way . . .|0
Very good film . Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted people they are. Very good . Thank you. I loved this movie so much, my friend and I watched it in 3 days. He said it was his first documentary and I thought so too, as he has a degree in anthropology, I had to remind him that he didn't have an education, but a BA. I am so happy we were able to watch this movie. Thank you for allowing us in on the adventure. Very good film.Very good.|0
I saw this title again on Shemaroo . I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same video at his house and the same conclusion was reached as mine . He also said he could not believe what he heard from his father and other family members who had not seen the film themselves but heard about it from his friends. He was shocked and saddened. If you’re a person of color, an activist, or one who has any interest in women’s issues in the US, there’s a new movie you’ve never seen on Netflix titled The Invisible War.|0
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron! ), the piano-playing dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back, funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc.|1
A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European's idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament.|1
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making . The pacing is poor , the budget must have been very high and the photography is bland . And the last half hour has the worst ending that i have come across in a lot of films . This film will probably make a few fans who love kannada but that's it. The film makers have made a film with just 2 songs and some background music but the film itself is a huge disappointment. This film was a film which could have done better in making a story.|0
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.|1
"The inspiration for the ""Naked Gun"" movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like ""Airplane!"" and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving.It's too bad that the show only had six episodes."|1
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. We are treated to some really good performances as you can tell by the names that are written on some of the cards. I will not say all names as it would give the wrong impression. Anyway, my point is, the film has a good plot, and good characters and some great acting that I really like. This film also does have a lot of violence, but I do like it in a way that I can appreciate and I like the story line.|0
"I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge."" I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see ""small"" movies about ""small"" people in ""small"" bars that are in ""small"" towns."|1
It looked cool from the movie sleeve , but after five minutes we were n't sure if it was a gimmick. But it turns out, it is not. It is real , and so are you . And if you think this is cool, you will never be cool alone. The world is not as cool as you think It's true. But you, you're a cool person. There is no better way to find your inner cool than to find yourself alone. You don't have to seek the cool-out, it's already on you.|0
This movie was completely stale and uninspired . The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical characters going on a journey to get together in India and have sex. I don't see what the problem is. Why is it bad that these characters are going to do what they're doing? Why is it wrong? There is no reason why these characters are trying to do something that isn't in their culture or why they are doing this. In other words, they are going around doing something that they do, and in India, that isn't abnormal for them.|0
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber. The film makers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie, and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory collection of poppycock. I almost started rooting for the mexicans, just to get the damn thing to end.|1
`` Valley Girl '' launched Nicolas Cage 's career and was an 80 's version of `` Romeo and Juliet'' starring Cameron Mitchell . She has also been played by many other well known actors including Julia Roberts and Jennifer Love Hewitt .

It is currently the highest-rated film of all time on IMDB, with over 5 million ratings . -- '' '' '' Valley girl '' is the title of several books by James M. Cain.|0
"Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire , and , as well, the story , the story is good - it does not take itself too seriously - in fact it has a light touch to it. The acting is great, the love interest is nice, but I really don't care much about the male lead - I've seen it before, and it was pretty good. ""A man is only as good as his intentions, and only as bad as his means""

I agree with the previous posters here, this movie is a terrible mess."|0
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff . One of the greatest movies of all time. I highly recommend this film to people who like action movies with good special effects. The story is very good , the special effects are fantastic. One of the best movies you'll find on this site. You'll love it. If you like it , rent it. It's also a great movie for the kids . It's a great family film. This movie will stick in your mind for a long time. It has everything you want in an action movie.|0
This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule.|1
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. This is, without peer, the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. I had nightmares of this movie ever since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. The film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived from).|1
"Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough? ), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!)"|1
This film was a wonderful romp , intelligent , playful , mysterious , full of surprises , with humor in spades. If you've ever watched a film in this genre and found yourself laughing out loud at one point during the movie , you've got a good idea of what it takes to make an excellent comedy. As for the film itself . . . well , what more can be said . . . . The story is well-structured , cleverly conceived . . . . There are plenty of twists and turns in this film, and each one of them left me chuckling , smiling , and wondering .|0
As Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age, a solid script, and some great Disneyesque songs, and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed, without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.This is simply fun, but it is also a well made, well written, beautifully endearing classic.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.|1

I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard of it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion.|1

The local priest (who formerly dated Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of ""House"" and the writer/director of ""House II"". I loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students."|1
This movie is truly unbelievable , in every sense of the word . I could n't believe what I was seeing, but it was true. This movie has got to be the best in the world, not only for the story it tells , but for everything that goes into its making . This movie has got it all and more , including a great cast, beautiful photography , a truly unique soundtrack , and the best use of color . I have to say that I had to see this movie twice , to really appreciate everything it had to offer, and I still cannot believe I did it .|0
My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it . That all ended seconds into it. It's actually quite a fun flick, but you really need a lot of tolerance to get through the film. I just don't think I am capable of dealing with it. Yeah, I can't believe I didn't think of that before. This is why I'm always so critical of the movies I love. There's so much going on, and it can go so fast, and you never know what the ending might be, and I don't want to ruin the surprise.|0
Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par.|1
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live . It took me a week to get it and I am very happy with my purchase as I had never seen any Turkish movie before. My wife and son loved this movie. I recommend this movie to you if you want a wonderful movie and I hope it will be a big hit. I am glad I bought it. It is funny. My wife loved it. When she saw it she was very happy. I enjoyed watching this movie.|0
"I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I was hoping it would end.It had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and Years) together in ""Separate"" beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. He does kiss her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible about it. Very little substance to grab your interest. The acting just does not hold up. He is very passive."|1
This is a really silly job of miscasting -- about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON BALL. Still, that's one movie I want to see in its own movie, just to see how that would have turned out. I don't want to re-watch those three movies, but there's a good chance that they'd be interesting in some form or fashion to somebody. I think I'd even pay to see them again, but then I'd have to buy a new TV set for my bedroom. So for now I'll just watch them in my head.|0
"Loosely based on actual events, ""River's Edge"" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.The film begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1)."|1
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a wife and son, he can sing, play guitar, run marathons and he can write. He can do anything, but it would be a lie to say he has everything. He has lost a good deal of weight, and he has a bad back that can be an issue. His eyesight is limited and he has difficulty reading the road. Russel is an avid reader, as are most men his age, but there is one book he is reluctant to read in.|0
The basic plot is good and can be engaging . The music is so great that it became the theme song to the drama. The director is a genius. And the film has been adapted from a book so well I almost cried. I cried because the movie made me realize I’ve been hiding in shame about my weight. And because of the way the film made me feel, and the fact I’ve had my heart broken by several people before, I had to know the secret. It made me realize I was the type to keep things to myself.|0
This movie was everything but boring . It deals with reality . To the people who think this movie was not realistic, I assure you that after watching this , you will definitely believe that everything is possible. The story was so real, that you have to believe that it really happens in this movie. I just hope that this movie will help the world . It will definitely make people change . I just want to recommend it to everyone who has not watched this movie . Don't believe the critics who say that this movie was not true . It is the best movie for everyone .|0
"I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto . the story is really good . the music is good , and it does it justice. this is a first class film , and i have to say , i liked it , and recommend it for all naruto fans. and for me , i can see it in 4 . Mikael

this movie is amazing . the story line is so epic and it had a great twist at the end that makes the story even better . this is an epic movie , and a good one at that ."|0
This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th Century and early 21st. So when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about telling us that.Also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country.|1
"This was an interesting movie . I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWWW - but this was an interesting story and the performances by all of the leads were very good. The movie had a great sense of humor. I liked the way the director kept some things to a low key and kept others on the screen. You had to see it because the actors were good! If you are a ""fan"" of romantic comedies you'll love this one, I promise. It was funny, the plot and characters were well-written, and very well cast."|0
^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap. Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. No one can even cry believably.If you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.For example, I left the room for a second, while Jennie Garth's character was sleeping with her manager.|1
I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible ! I expected it to be soooo boring and stupid ! I didn’t like this movie at all ! Now let’s get to how the movie ended ! First off , I want to say it is really easy to see how this film was very similar to the Star Wars movies. In both movies, the people are like “why did you have to destroy our planet? What did you have in mind by doing that? I don’t believe you” !|0
I'm sorry but I just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like they were on this show!! Personally I'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. If anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then I honestly feel sorry for them.|1
"Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. They might as well call this show ""Generic"", because that's what it is. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals."|1
"I am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their ""problems"" all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). ""Hack"" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good histories. I just love it!! I hope ""Hack"" will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change."|1
Good old Jess Franco ! The always-reliable choice of director in case you 're looking for undemanding sleaze , shamelessly self-serving trash, or just good old fun. This time out , we get to see him in a movie that's an old friend of his, with a twist: a story about the death of a teenage boy, and how his mother was trying to make her way on her own, in the aftermath. It's another of those films where a lot of people are going to be surprised when they see what they get.|0
We all enjoyed the movie . It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos . It was also an entertaining movie that is hard to describe . I found it very hard to sit through the 2 hours that it took , but i guess it has to be because there were so many things going on that i had to pay close attention to . But after all it was worth the wait . The story had everything that you could ever want in a story line . It was very unique and original . The script and direction was also very creative and entertaining .|0
The reason why this movie sucks , have these people even read a bible ? Everything in the movie was scripted and made up. I'm sorry to say that it wasn't well done . I don't watch movies much, so I didn't give it much thought . It was alright in my opinion and I was bored . If you can't do anything right, then don't waste your time. That's what I do when I watch films. Just read the book... You just need to know that I was not impressed with the movie.|0
Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable.It left me yearning for a real film. :)The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes, which dissipates any discernible tension.And the character relationship 'twists'? Yeah, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline.|1
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to leave it to the imagination to guess what will happen. This is something I believe strongly in when I’m watching films. There is no way that the audience can know in advance the answer to everything. So why would we, as filmmakers, choose to leave that opportunity open and allow the audience to guess the ending to the story? I think that, as a director, you do not want to have the audience guessing the ending.|0
Who said it had to be believable ? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to write this article. It doesn't need to be the whole truth. The problem is this: It is impossible to know what would happen if Trump got elected. It could get very ugly. The world would be plunged into the worst nuclear war the world has seen since 1945, with hundreds of millions dead to start with, and then more millions more to come in the years ahead to come.|0
The only reason i didn't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it...the only and i repeat the ONLY effect that they used is a weird kapoera (from India?) jump on a half meter wall/trash cans, i mean, effects doesn't make a movie but... sheesh.... me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used pharmacy's ..... and they found guns?!|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear . it is a performance that has won the heart and soul of the entire audience. the story of an old man who never goes a day without his teddy bear is a timeless classic that has become a part of every family's life. Mr. Bean is truly a timeless classic. in the movie, he meets an attractive young woman who offers to teach him how to live a better life. the movie stars an old man who is not sure what the future holds.|0
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people encouraged the Fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie.|1
I had heard good things about `` States of Grace '' and came in with an open mind . I didn't have any expectations at this point; so when I first opened the book, I got to page 6. I did not expect much from page 6 onward. As I went through the first few chapters, I was impressed with how realistic and realistic-looking was the book . It had a realistic look; there were pictures . There were realistic people and realistic scenes . It really seemed that there was something to be excited about and something to be depressed about.|0
I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.|1
"One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see, I guess he's fair game to criticize. And that's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a ""star"") Being gay and forty, I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover."|1
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure, the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort.|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy.|1
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine.|1
There's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. Hell hath no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo(Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami.|1
I love cheesy horror movies , I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party is very underrated and I also think if you give people a reason to go and watch them then good for them I am not saying that the slumber party series was perfect but I do think that there are a lot of people out there that would enjoy it and that's what it's for and to me it doesn't make you look like a total loser because you've gone off the rails and done things that are way out there .|0
This was my late wife's favorite film. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as I'm sure she would have worn it out. What can we say? A great romantic story and the push off of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow.|1
"Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood's handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in ""Tarantula"" where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack."|1
Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable , and overacted . This movie could n't make up it 's' own mind, and it made me realize I was watching the movie from the eyes of my five year old, I must have been watching it for the wrong reasons in a lot of areas. It had me in tears, because it made me think of the times of my youth when my mother would take me to the theatre and I was the only person not crying at the opening of a movie that was supposed to be the best, I would never see that movie.|0
Although this movie (and I use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway, certain that if Jones was in the movie, it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses, I was additionally reassured by seeing another well-known face.|1
"I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both very happy with the film. I had hoped that the director would have used all of the locations in the film. This film is worth watching. Reviews (1)

""This is not a review, this is an analysis of the script, as if this were an article of faith. The story is well told and acted with a good cast.The acting is solid, and the dialogue is believable, but there's nothing new here to warrant a repeat viewing."""|0
I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006).This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it).Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!'|1
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Sure it moved a bit slow at times. I liked it.As far as MST3K goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker for example.Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously.|1
Hearkening back to those `` Good Old Days '' of 1971 , we can vividly recall when we were treated like gods . Our cars were like spaceships that flew into the windshield , while we looked out of our windows like space-walkers . And what about our clothes? We wore a whole lot more than just some old T-shirts. We had suits , shirts , dresses , and suits that had pockets and pants with zippers on the fly . That was the way you dressed in the 60 s , and that's how you dressed for the 70 s too.|0
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something else. I watched it, though I have not watched the whole thing yet, and I found that I really enjoyed it. It is very well done and I liked the movie. Some of my opinions are that it was very funny and a lot of it was funny, even though it may not have been very funny at times. There is a lot of very clever jokes that you can tell from what he says but you do not really have to understand the joke to enjoy the movie.|0
I love the way he experiments . Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and Pratap do. I am happy to say that this was a very successful season for us and hopefully we will continue to give our viewers some of the best entertainment. After the amazing success of Ab Tak Chhappan Season 3, we are very excited to go ahead in our plans with Season 4 and are currently working on the show as well as preparing the storyline. This is one of the highest rated shows on Colors TV, and it is the only show which we are planning to do a Season 4.|0
I really wanted to like this film , especially after all the buzz I 'd heard revolving around it . I 'd heard good things so I decided to give it a shot . It was only after seeing this film that I realized that I 've actually been enjoying it . It 's also not a perfect movie . There are a few moments where a little more care could have been taken with the screenplay . It 's a movie where everything works , and it works pretty well . But then , it works pretty badly at other moments . I don 't mind it though , it's just that .|0
I could watch this movie ALL DAY ! I LOVE it . Probably my all time favorite movies . But it was a very long and very boring movie .I was hoping that at least it would start off slow and then the plot would pick up again . But the movie was extremely boring . I didn't feel like watching the movie at all . But I did love it . It had great lines and it was a great movie . I really do think it would make a great tv movie . But alas it wasn't a tv movie .|0
I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. *spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they aren't scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all.|1
This film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but I am not sure what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. There are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie.|1
What a cast ... and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , Ben Stiller , and the rest of the cast in it , it is only a matter of time before they kill each other off . Not this one . This one is about the friendship of two men who discover that they have a mutual love for women . And that the only thing standing in their way of realizing this is the woman's father . Of course , they both have ulterior motives for finding this out .|0
I ca n't knock this film too terribly , because it 's obvious midway through the the watching of it , you know what it is and it is not what it is billed as . for a start , there ' s not one scene that even faintly resembles what we are being presented with . you know , when you are not given a reason to see what you are watching , you have to see that it ' s good , or you go home . and i can ' t really understand how any viewer could take the time to see this movie .|0
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in politics. I don't see how this is a good idea - it's an obvious attempt to create an atmosphere where people will accept and be happy about a certain type of politics. And I find it strange that a lot of people (especially younger ones) do not understand the meaning of ""left"" and ""right"", but they do not care about this, and will not be scared by it."|0
At least if you 're a Disney fanatic ( well , of the variety who loves their live-action films as much as you do) you would know the name of your favorite villain. Now, I am sure that your favourite villain in all of Disney movies would be Aladdin and his evil step-father. So, let us talk about Aladdin and what makes him your favourite. Well, let us start! Let us start with the story part. Aladdin's story is one of the most famous Disney stories of the last century. But why is he your favourite villain of Disney films?|0
There is a serious scene in this movie . A scene that lets you know that his film wo n't go in the way that the director wanted it to . And that it has the power to make you forget everything that you know about this movie and its protagonist . And if you want to understand him , you need to watch the film again and again . This film was released in the year 1996 . And since it is the first time in my memory I saw this film in its original aspect ratio , I'm going to compare this with other movies I've seen in my life .|0
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite.|1

Hard to believe - but it is ! I should n't be surprised . Commercials try to show how unique, how new, how good . They must have a good product, an attractive offer, and something that is different or better . It is always in the advertising that a product or service will be a better way to do something or save money. It must be good to sell a product or service, and be better or cheaper than what is already out on the market . Some people just do not like commercials - and do not have time to watch them for the sake of watching them .|0
"i was one ""chosen"" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game ""far cry"", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's ""the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail""."|1
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . But even worse , what I noticed after a few years was that, I can't hear well. Now , not hearing is normal , as the name suggests . But I can't hear what's going on. I had my hearing tested a year ago. It said that I have hearing loss in both the ears. It says I can't hear high frequencies , like conversations or the TV . It also says I can't hear anything below a whisper .|0
"What to say about ""Dead End Road""...Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, writing, effects, and everything in this movie was just horrendous. That doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had to sit through. That is also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally I didn't care what happened to the characters. I have seen bad but this was definitely the worst. I got hyped up for this because I am a fan of Poe and this was just bad."|1
"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" is a peculiar movie. Like I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors."|1
"""The Journey"" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), ""The Journey"" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home."|1
"Mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn't really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like ""Gymkata"" and ""The Pumaman,"" ""No Holds Barred"" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling."|1
"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior."|1
"Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous ""fantasy"" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on ""The Shield"") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those ""Saturday Night Live"" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done."|1
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film, it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege.|1
I watched this movie with big expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.Sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations.|1
I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film . Just not believable in the role . Barbara Eden is a much better actor than him . She did a beautiful job . I loved this movie . My favorite thing about the film is that it is completely original . It did not borrow any elements from anything or anyone . This movie was not made for profit and it does not belong to any one genre . All it has is a good story and the cast was excellent . The storyline is interesting . The movie is well directed . The direction and editing work very well .|0
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. This one though, is missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.Im in agreement with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. In this one, he is heading the emergency office. Being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. Clever thinking.|1
At the time of this writing ( January 25 , 2006 ) , I am saddened to hear of the murder of the Palestinian journalist Jamal Halawa, who was killed for daring to write about the Palestinian cause in a foreign language. His murder is yet another blow to the cause of Palestinian unity and solidarity. I am even further saddened to know that the murderers of the Palestinian journalist are from the same Arab-Islamic State. Halawa was killed in the city of Gaza. He was known for his coverage of a daily newspaper on Gaza, which he edited for a number of years, before it closed down.|0
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time . In fact , I want to see the movie so badly that I am willing to see it a third time just so I am not left out . I just finished watching Hannibal . And I am going to say it was the best damn movie that I have seen in quite some time. I agree. I agree completely with you on this one. I love this film. I’ve only watched a couple of times and I must say it was very good. The story is extremely well told.|0
"This is an interesting movie . I think it 's very humorous , although the humor is very black . I agree with the author of the blogpost who says ""the point is to see if you can identify with them even when they're racist ."" The movie can be a very funny one . I think many of us think it's a great movie and we laugh at the jokes . But there is a lot of racism in this movie . It's very hard to explain the humor of this film without making the movie racist ."|0
Superhero Movie ( 2008 ) is the most recent in the long line over `` parody '' movie movies which began in 1984 with Star Trek. The movie is based on the comic strip `` Star Wars ','' which has been one of the top-selling comic strips for decades, first by Dark Horse Comics in the late eighties and now by Lucasfilm Ltd, which produces all Star Wars movies. The movie is not so much a '' movie as a comic book movie,'' in that the scenes and dialogue are mostly drawn and narrated from a comic book.|0
I am a firm believer that a film , TV serial or any form of art should and would be more successful if it was written as well as it is filmed, and that it would be just as if someone wrote it, filmed it and put it online for the rest of us to enjoy. So with this film I have aimed to deliver exactly that - to provide you, the viewer , with an authentic and real film experience, which is why I have put all my love, enthusiasm, belief and hard work into making the story come to life and make your viewing experience as enjoyable as possible.|0
Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction.|1
Eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. This movie shows a good aspect on the human body being God's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. Actress/model Inger Ebeltoft's impersonation of Eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress being Eve.|1
"The plot involves a new , hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin 's barbershop . It turns out it's not just the new franchise, but the entire street has been renamed to honor one of the barbershops in town, the original. This is where the plot's first major twist happens. When the "" original "" (as they're now called in Calvin's shop ) is forced to leave town after Calvin's brother dies, it leaves Calvin and his brother alone with no place to live."|0
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of a sorority I didn't want them to make Greek organizations look bad....but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.All the characters are pretty likable minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha His character brings so much to the show.|1
I was looking forward to Dante 's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime , but this was a tough one to review. My first impression was, this is a good addition to the series, and it did not disappoint. There were some very scary scenes, but there were also scenes that I felt didn't deliver, but that was only on the last 30 pages. They were all well written and delivered a bit of scares. I really enjoyed watching Dante's character, and his involvement with the story. My only negative point was, the ending.|0
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish , for a moment forget the famous 28 years that have passed since then . The film opens with a shot of a woman reading a magazine in a beautiful and expensive apartment. When we see the woman again she is in a car with her lover. She says to her lover, I want to take you out and have you meet me. My car is waiting. So that is how we end up driving to the beach where the man's car is waiting for him.|0
This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced.|1
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombard. And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American didn't bring war here. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused.The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people.|1
There are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) Copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns.|1
When I first saw this show i thought to my self `` What is this ! ! ! ! ! ?'' But once you get over that initial shock, this show is a must see ! ! ! ! I love this show ! ! ! ! I don't watch many shows these days, but I have a hard time staying from watching this show. it is not like the shows that I used to watch like '' S.W.A.T. ! ! ! ! '' but I enjoy watching all types of shows. I wish it could be made to the show that it is not !|0
Dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS!!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. Due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. No one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. This should be a crime and.... I cant believe you would ruin a book like that.|1
"Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who's the working definition of the word ""dreamer"" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California.Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.Could be better, could be worse.I gave this one seven out of ten."|1
... and I 'm so disappointed because I ca n't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its a shame really as it was a very good flick and I'm very interested in seeing if it's worth buying on dvd or if i shoul d rent the dvd. I got to watch this and it was awesome. I saw it about 3 years ago. I really like the idea of a kid playing a role. The music is awesome and the story is also awesome. But, I don't think that it would work as an adult movie with that story line.|0
I was sorely disappointed in this movie. Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. The movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.Dutcher's God's Army One was okay.|1
It's astonishing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. Injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. When we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. And believe me, it does seem endless.|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store, people around me started laughing, doesn't matter the age or gender. A teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears.. Episodes had a touching and funny ending, specially last one.|1
This movie is on cable sporadically , and I never really watched it , thinking it would be similar to an episode of House or some such . The movie does have a lot in it that is similar in theme to an episode of House , which I was unaware of at the time , as House , the original series, did not come out on TV until after the original series. The basic premise is about a young man, played by Will Smith, who returns to his hometown after his parents died to take over his family's thriving business.|0
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth , and the 150th anniversary of the publication of the book that popularized his theories of evolution and human origins. In celebration , The New York Times has put together an exhibition called Darwin at the Edge of Evolution , which traces the evolution of Darwin's ideas through to their current form. The exhibition, which opens on Monday, takes a critical look at some of Darwin's most popular theories about our origins — the idea that we are the product of ""natural selection"" in nature and the idea that we developed as a result of a process called evolution."|0
In my opinion the directing , editing , lighting , and acting ( minus Franco ) were very good . The script was good but needed more work . I thought the ending was a bit hard to swallow but I was wrong . I liked the music and the score ( although a tad overused at times ) was well done . The film is definitely a must see . I would recommend this flick to anybody . It’s a good flick with very good acting . This was my first time watching an American film and I was really happy . I recommend this one to anybody .|0
Definition of documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and barely learned a thing about them.The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anybody and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And is listening to people recite TMBG lyrics like they were supposed to be funny/interesting? It was neither.|1
"This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on. But, I'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like ""The West Wing"" or ""Commander-in-Chief."" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in ""Early Edition""). It was a pain to sit through this show."|1
"First off , I 'm not a firefighter , but I 'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit ( the guys I work with are not really firefighters , they are just doing it for the day )
I've got to say , I have to give them credit , they do it really well. I 'm also not a member of any other organization, but I have to say , I have gotten to know so many good firefighters , that I really think they are good people. They do a lot, but they never stop."|0
This is a semi fictional memoir of an `` international man '' who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent times.The first section is based on the author's experience of his life in the Indian Army. It describes how he became a part of the freedom movement. The next two sections is based on the author's experience at the forefront of the struggle for Indian Independence. The final part is a brief description of his life in the Indian army after the independence. In the first section, he narrates the events which shaped his personality and personality.|0
Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets better and better as it gets older. And then when the price comes down, there is not enough left over to fill my glass. They are the same with news. The news is no more news, they have no more substance to them. I agree with what you wrote. The quality of the news has gone down so far as to make it virtually worthless. There is simply too much crap and garbage out there.|0
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings, but that isn't saying much.The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies.|1
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it.|1
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. Sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, OTT and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.There is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on.|1
"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots , yes Camp Blood ( or if they don't go to the camp you can see them there doing whatever the hell they want)

If this is too much for you then do yourself a favor and turn around and go back into your apartment and watch TV and not do anything at all. Go out to the club, go out to dinner with your girlfriend and then maybe you can get your act together and get back home and start your day in a decent way."|0
"This one and the one prior ""Toulon's Revenge"" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series."|1
As is the case with many films of this ilk , my non Catholicism got in the way of my appreciation of the final product. This isn’t a film, per se (though I really don’t know what that’s supposed to mean…), but a film that would be more than enough to get the non-believer of my acquaintance into the “faith” camp. The plot is pretty basic. A man goes to visit his girlfriend who lives in the country with her family. She’s married, but he sees her with another man.|0
Unless there 's some huge ironic conspiracy going on , my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of the new Star Wars trilogy. For the last seven years, I've been a loyal fan. In my opinion, there was no way the new trilogy would be any worse than the first two. So, why would anyone care to read a three-book collection of stories that don't do enough? If you've been following along with my review of The Force Awakens, then you know that I give it three and half stars.|0
A killer ( John Karlen ) with a penchant for really bad disguises ( afro wig on a white dude, for example) comes to town. But is he a real killer? Or just a bad actor trying to make a little money. And how do you make a good bad guy? And can a real-life serial killer be good in a movie? What is a serial killer really like? What makes them tick? These were all questions I had as a young child, but of course, the answers didn't make it into the movies I saw.|0
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen , right from the start the movie goes straight down hill from then on and never stops until the credits roll in. The acting is terrible by the way and the plot is uninteresting at best. The acting, the story line, the plot is all unoriginal. The music is the worst, very loud and annoying. There are a couple of decent songs in this movie and they aren't bad, but they aren't good either. All in all I give it 1 stars out of 10.|0
Great party movie , following the adventures of Bill & Tom , two high school buddies at opposite ends of the American socio-political spectrum, who discover that they share an unusual kinship that leads them both to discover something of the truth about the universe and to try to change their world for the better . Based on the best-selling memoir by Michael Lewis, the screenplay by David Franzoni , from the book by the same title by Michael Lewis. The story begins in late September of 1963 when Bill O’Reilly, a conservative columnist and talk radio host in Chicago, goes to work for the television program “ Firing Line.|0
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time.|1
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. The odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. Supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.It is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied.|1
A moderately interesting start , some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan , and a promising idea . But the execution falls far short of what could have been a very entertaining film . It is worth seeing for the film, and not just to watch the Japanese film . And it might even be worth seeing again , with more time and maturity . I can't think why anyone else should see this , unless you want to see it for the first time (which is too bad ) . A moderately interesting film with some good characters , a surprising plot twist , and excellent acting .|0
Let's get one thing straight: I like much of Snipes' work. Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. This film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either. In fact, if I never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! It's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film.|1
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Bülow-Lüders is thrilled to be spending her honeymoon in a beautiful place, but she does not have enough money in the world to buy all the clothes that her husband, the Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen-Biebach, has sent her to buy. Her friends and relatives want her to buy more, but they don't have more money and they're afraid to ask her because she is so good-looking. As time goes on she finds she has more than enough money to buy her clothes.|0
I do n't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie , i mean really . You got rid of the romance , so why did they make the movie? . I mean i liked the rom-coms , so i was happy they were done . But the last movie was boring , it had a plot but the only reason it worked was the chemistry . I am so bored . You could make this movie with the rom-com plot and they would have a better result than this . I mean i hope that when it comes out it will make it way past the 15 million dollar mark .|0
Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained.|1
"The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan. After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the ""key to the universe"" that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about. Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. Each has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. All of the actors give great performances."|1
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days, Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy acting of lead Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it.|1
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was . Once in a while you see something in the news, and you have a chance to see it first hand, and in person. When I was asked to join a class that was training for a day long event, my first thought was, “Why the hell do I want to be in a class that would include such a thing?” And yet, because of the incredible support from my husband and family, this was the best event I’ve ever taken part in.|0
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch. Too unreal. It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. Who couldn't do that? The cheating was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards?|1
This film was n't good at all . I was able to catch it at a film festival and did not want to watch it after . I believe it's because of the story , but I still had no idea what it was about . I don't understand it because of the movie , but I have to say I'm surprised that I liked it . The cast is all good , and the actors in this movie were really good . The plot was simple , but I think it still made for a good film . But I won't be watching it again because I thought it was really bad .|0
Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was soooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disapointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it did suck. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too dense or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't see it!|1
In Brooklyn , the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in a Manhattan club on the arm of a wealthy businessman. Her life is turned upside down when he is murdered and she is found to have been the victim. In the Bronx , a young prostitute and singer is found shot to death at a party, and the police suspect the local mobster she works for for the murder. Her body, which had been drugged with drugs and alcohol, is found to be missing.|0
OK , I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum . That was the main reason I did not like this film. Why? Well because I felt that her character was one of the biggest problems for the film. There is only one Sophie in the film and when that Sophie is gone, the film is pretty good. In fact , I felt like I had seen the film before but I couldn't remember what the plot was. But what a great film this is . First of all let me say that the film is not a typical comedy .|0
With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog).|1
Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Mask of Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoir's 'The Southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money.|1
"If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you 're hoping for another `` Vidocq '' ... well, sorry, I guess that's about it for now. It was really really cool, I enjoyed it and would like to add a few comments about it in the video:

The way it's made is pretty good for a movie with that sort of plot, and I'm really glad this is the first thing I've seen that was animated using cgi, but I have to say I thought it looked a bit odd - like there was a lot of green on the screen."|0
Another sequel! Why on earth do they keep making these? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only watched so I could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... That's basically it. The acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think.|1
"Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France-we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. Polite, patient, genial. Although my French is testy, I got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the ""old"" terror growers interviewed-esp."|1
Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what the new artist would bring to the series, but I was also looking forward to a little bit more from this series. What I’m getting from this third entry in the series is very similar to the previous two Qatsi books, and is much better than the previous two installments. But the book is definitely not perfect and I think the reason is because this book didn’t really try to develop any new elements of the story.|0
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome! Check it out and you'll be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. Both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. The music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict.|1
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. I don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in Ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. I love the serious look that he's got going on. Its like that programme that was on on a Sunday morning that i forget the name of lol.|1
"I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ""The Dain Curse"". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film ""The Molly Maguires""). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south."|1
"Wow. Just wow. Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then i happened to come upon ""Lady Frankenstein"". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on Italian TV, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like i have, as number 24. And lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here."|1
As was mentioned by others , could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see the actors in the roles they have played in other films ? I can only guess that I am just being overly picky. I was hoping if there was a chance that the film would be any good. I am looking forward to seeing the actors again in a better capacity than I have ever seen in their previous movies. The best way I know to review a movie before seeing it is to see it.|0
Oh man , this movie was toe-cringing bad . Bad look , awful story ... the list of good things goes on and on . there's no happy ending , of course . in a way , i can think of at least a few more happy endings for the characters . but here's the problem with happy endings for this film . it's not a happy ending , it's an ending . a lot of movies have ended with a happy ending , even if the characters are miserable . it's just easier . but here the story ends with the characters at a point they haven't reached in their relationship .|0
There 's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon 's `` Robe d'Ete '' . It 's surprising how much is left out. There are no subtitles here. There are no credits on the end credits, either. It makes it feel like a documentary that you don 't know what's coming next, though you have the idea it will lead into the second half of the film that will be a series of photos. It does, but the pictures are very different from what you 're expecting and they aren 't what you thought at first.|0
HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS , A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG BLOODY HOUNDS? 1. We are all familiar with one-on-one fights. But what if it were a team fight? Where there were several people fighting, each one taking on another, each with a different weapon? 2. In this team-fighting scene, there is more than just two fighters. There is more than just fists. 3. There are knives, chains, guns, swords, spears, and even chainsaws. And all are used in a coordinated manner.|0
I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue.|1
After the success of Star Wars , there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies . This was one of the major factors that helped the Star Wars franchise reach a wider audience. Some of these movies were made into successful movies like the “ Clone Wars “ series . But other than these, the only other sci-fi movies that came close to becoming a hit were James Cameron‘s “ Avatar “ and the “ Transformers “ series . And the reason these movies didn’t became a massive hit is that audiences were expecting something different from the two movies , especially in the way that Cameron handled the CGI .|0
I usually don't categorize a moving as boring. I am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. Unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. Terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience.|1
The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was ... not very good at all.Like others , I felt like I wasn't seeing things, or that I was missing things (the dialogue, for example) from the original version, which I didn't really understand until much later.This was also the first time I had seen the original Star Wars trilogy (Episode IV-V) and didn't quite like any of them (in that order). This was probably due to the fact that I didn't know the original story. I watched it all in the order of the trilogy (i.e.|0
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and Jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.But she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions.|1
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see. It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one. Even thou I'm not interested in football I wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up.|1
SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo ? Yep , that 'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of `` Lord of the Rings ' ', all of Middle-Earth have had the chance to find out what happens to the Ring when Frodo finds out its true power. And they've found out . I'm talking about the movie version of Tolkien's novel. The one with Daniel Craig, who is the best thing that has happened to this book since Peter Jackson. You know what ? It doesn't feel like a fantasy movie, and that's not because it tries to do too much.|0
1 . I 've seen Branaghs Hamlet : Branagh is too old , speaks frequently with a high pitched voice and doesn't know who is speaking , I think it is a very good production, although it's too bad there is not one more scene in which one could hear some Shakespeare, or a film that would show us the world in the light of Shakespeare 's words. I really liked this film, it's not a bad film , it's just not really the kind of film I want to see as a viewer .|0
This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. For god's sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. And where do I begin? The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@!|1
It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.|1
I 've seen a few bad action movies in my days , but this one 's just plain awful . When I heard the title , I thought , what is this about ? and what's the point of having a story with bad action ? . Then I read the tag line of the movie , The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly . So, I sat down and watched the movie and was amazed at how it really was a good, bad and the ugly at the same time , which made it even worse . It was very hard to watch , and very ,very boring .|0
"Oh boy ! Oh boy ! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and Tom Cruise . Not only that but there is the tag line:

'When the Bullocks meet the Cruisees, they'll change their life forever.' I could not believe my eyes, until I saw it on the news today. I had to take a second look to see what all the fuss was about - and to see what it meant to me. I read this and thought, oh Lord, that would be wonderful for Sandra Bullock if Tom Cruise was her boyfriend."|0
I 'm not a movie snob . I 've liked lots of movies that critics hate , and I 've also liked some critics who I thought were just too kind. I don't really have a set list of critics who I like. But I like some critics who I like more than any others. I want the movies I like most of the time but I don't want to feel that I 'm missing something that might be a better movie. I don't want to miss something that will make me feel that I 'm missing something I want to see when I have a chance.|0
"This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. ""I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin."" ""We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad."" ""It is nice when we all screw each other."" Lots to talk about! Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions."|1
I 'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes , so I watched this show when it came out in 2007, because I was desperate to see something new and different. To me, Patricia is a brilliant character with an intriguing mind, but it can be a frustrating one too. I thought this was a great show, because it was so different from the rest of the BBC shows at the time. I think it has a wonderful blend of mystery, magic and the occult, combined with a very witty and quirky main character.|0
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a classic of the genre. Its also a classic of Hollywood’s attempt to use the best of Hollywood’s art of the silent era. This film is from 1931. The action begins in Africa where a tribe is attacked by the White hunters, who capture some of their members, but they later return to kill them, thus, making the entire tribe flee. The film opens with the white hunter and a beautiful woman in the African jungle.|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. Loch Ness Monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. Plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role.|1
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly is n't a perfect movie , but I 'm pretty sure it was never meant to be perfect. It is a movie that has its own identity, and its own flaws. It has its own voice. There 's just no denying that. You have to see this, even if it is not your kind of style. If you 're looking for good horror, well, this could be the one to take a look at. I'm glad that it 's available for a rental, and I hope you 're the same way.|0
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot twist. Well, it's original in its plot, but the twist doesn't come until the movie's end. That was one of the worst things about this movie, it was supposed to have a strong plot twist, and it just sort of fell into an ending that was predictable even to fans. The cast was also decent, and some decent action scenes, even though I don't have high expectations for these.|0
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans , in the beginning of the Twentieth Century , the Moroccan king, Mohammed V, , decided to try to stop it, as he had no choice but to do because he did not want to lose his independence, since the French and the British had just annexed his country to their empires. Mohammed V , who was named Mohammed VI in 1884, saw how the French army was occupying Morocco , and he sent an army of 12,000 soldiers to attack the foreigners. He had a plan to do that, and he started to do it in 1872.|0
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film . The writing , acting , directing could not have been better . This was one of the best made films . The script , direction was fantastic . The action was good , the characters were believable . The acting , direction , music , cinematography . The music was superb . A very good film . I thought it was brilliant . I did not understand a lot of what they were saying but I did get a good feeling about the film . I also thought it did a very good job of showing how people could be so different yet still so similar .|0
"Well , I 'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento , Fulci , Argento , D'Amato , De Luca , Spinella , Tarkovski , Vanni , Fulci , Fulvio , Fulci , Spinella and many others that I can mention but, for now, here 's an old classic Italian Horror movie from my childhood, ""La Vita dell'anima"" from the 70's . You see , I love Italian Horror movies in general , that is, anything from the 50's to today , but this movie really got my attention and I really liked it ."|0
I awarded this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which has been butchered beyond recognition in places. What can possibly be said? They took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides -- and insights -- ripped out). I do very much blame the director, who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script.|1
"This movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all ""gringos"" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. All that is outside one's country's border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else."|1
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of Director Jack Swanstrom. Clearly, Swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.This thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. As with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie.|1
While my kids enjoyed the movie ( and announced afterward that they want to buy it later ) I think it might not have had the impact on them that it could have had on someone who has not been exposed to it before. For instance, I think I would have taken to the movie more enthusiastically had I heard it all the way through as an adult, since it deals so directly with my experiences in the first world. It could have had a huge impact on me and my perspective on my own life, not just my life as a dad.|0
Well , I 've just seen Buster Keaton 's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle 's The Butcher Boy and-despite the fact that it is one of my favorite movies , I am struggling to explain to my family and friends how I can say it is the best film I have ever seen in my life . What do you do when the movie you love comes out , especially a silent film , and you don't understand what is happening on the screen ? Here are some of the words and phrases you can use when speaking about silent film at a dinner party.|0
Peter Strauss, by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films, often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, having channel-hopped into it half-way through. Well, I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film! !Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much....|1
"The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick . Sadly it 's more of a horror spoof and not actually scary as the title implies . The movie follows a high school history teacher who is convinced that he has been abducted by the "" evil beneath the surface ."" But he soon finds out that he has been living under an underwater volcano . The movie was directed by David Fincher who also directed the hit film Fight Club . This movie is pretty much like a combination of those two films , but a little less dark ."|0
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review . Bone Eater hits its mark for being one of the best books I have ever read. You would have to read it yourself to see what it can do. I just finished it for the first time this morning and I cannot express how much I enjoyed this story. If you haven't read this, then you need to give it a try. I don't know about you, but I can't put it down. If you like horror, then you will truly enjoy this book and you'll want to read it again.|0
`` Escape from Hell '' is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation . the story itself is not terrible . the only bad thing is that some of the characters are rather stereotyped and predictable . if the movie is as bad as some of the criticism states , i can see that there would be some criticism . this movie does have one redeeming quality , and it's one of its greatest strengths : the acting . and that brings me to a new topic , the acting . here's the problem : it's terrible , and i've noticed it for a while .|0
"The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my ""tilt switch"" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had."|1
The Toxic Avenger... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror... I even have read of a cult following with this series.... Now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that I couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think was to be the horror part of this movie...drug dealing, sumo, Godzilla entrance....|1
The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? Let's consider this movie as 'A History Of Violence' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now.|1
After some quite OK Dutch action flicks, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He isn't a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. But even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told.|1
Larry Bishop , the Writer/Actor/Director , focuses too heavily on the camera , music , and visuals . The film is in no way autobiographical , yet it feels more like an artistic tribute than any other work I’ve ever seen. The film has a dreamlike quality to it, one that I’ve rarely heard other films attempt. There are many reasons that I enjoyed the film , most of which are very personal. I had a difficult childhood which I’m very close to sharing with my characters. My father was very protective of my family , and he was not happy when I left home.|0
"First of all , the entire script is mostly improv , adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are seeing on screen has a real story behind it...

And it is one of the most hilarious films ever made, that’s what really makes it so amazing. This is one of those movies that will bring tears to your eyes, and also make you laugh until you feel like crying. You’ll laugh till you’re about to pee your pants, just because you can't help yourself from laughing. It’s funny , and it makes me laugh like a madman."|0
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot.|1
Somehow , I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing scenes , and I am a huge fan of climbing movies ( which are mostly about the mountains , I have to say ! ) I was wrong. For some reason , I just didn’t want to go on this trip, even the first time. I had no idea what was happening, I had no clue what I would be looking at, and that’s the way I want to feel when going on trips with my family.|0
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. There are petty crooks, political prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army plus some dangerous criminals.They are thrown into battle ill-equipped, untrained and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure.The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting.I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing.|1
... '' Flight of the Living Dead '' sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ``Zombie'' Zarnick, and the film feels like a cheap, throwaway imitation of Romero’s film ''Dawn of the Dead,'' which it bears some resemblance to. But it’s got enough of a sense of style that the film can’t completely fall apart in the editing, and the acting is good. But it does fall flat in some areas of execution, such as the way the zombie scenes are staged.|0
This is an excellent documentary about a story I had n't heard about before . The first solo , non-stop flight in history by a man without wings , it is also the first man without arms or legs to fly. The film tells a story that few people know or remember, and I am sure the many people who have seen the film will tell you of how the story should have ended. I am not one of the people who know this story and I am very glad I got to see the film.|0
What is this!! its so bad. The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. I sat through all of this film an then at the end I was annoyed when I realised I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD? A girl got shot?! What is up with that, it was just a stupid film.|1
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked . It 's a crime drama where a man gets out of prison after being falsely convicted for killing a drug dealer. He has a young son that he lost to a drug dealer. In doing so, he leaves his family for good. In his search for revenge he finds his way into a new life. This is one of the better films of the genre. The acting by all the main actors are top notch and there are so many things going on. There is one thing that sticks out the most from Rififi and this is that it 's the soundtrack.|0
"Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA , which is a beautiful town where it seems like everyone knows your name…

The first time I heard of the “Rockport Massacre”, I thought that I’d misheard a phrase I’d heard. I thought it was just a name that was mentioned in a movie, or a song. However, I later found out that it was a real-life crime that occurred in Rockport. It’s also worth noting that Rockport was a “crime-free” town. I was shocked but not surprised."|0
I am 17 , and a biased Muppet fan , and while I love Treasure Island , Christmas Carol and Peter and the Starcatcher , I don't think I have ever liked The Muppet Movie in the way I do the Muppet Christmas Carol, or even the Muppet Show . So I was really glad to hear that this Muppet Christmas Carol has a Muppets spin off . I don't know why, but it's something of an oddity in the Muppet world, since they usually have their own spin off, their own movie , their own comic , or at least their own book .|0
"The final part of Kieslowski 's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace, in love and at work. This time he looks at France, where he was born and brought up in the small town of Grenthe, outside of Paris. He also works for a while at a company called H.U.N.T.R.I.M., where he is, as he says in the film, ""a bit of a cowboy."" As he walks in the early morning hours along the boulevard of his childhood, we see him from the side and he stops at the spot where he grew up."|0
"Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says ""Isn't that clever? Am I not smart? Isn't that biting social commentary?"" And,sadly, the answer is always ""Ummmm...no."" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality."|1
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn't mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.|1
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and besides Jean Peters in the starring role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes.|1
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke 's Robicheaux mysteries . When I read 'In The Electric Room' the other day I wondered why the main character was such a bad person . I decided that it would have been better to have had him have a character trait that was much worse . I decided to look up some information on 's character, and saw that he was a former boxer. I had never known this fact when I first started reading 's books , but as I read through them it became obvious . He was also a member of the Communist party.|0
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA), Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look.|1
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film . One Life Stand is a stark drama that through the words of a simple young boy , has given hope to the world . I strongly believe this is the story of the power of a life to change a life . I think it's very true to say I've had the power to change so many lives . The way you look at your life is what makes it so hard and what makes it so easy , this is a great quote by Dr Wayne Dyer and I believe this is what makes the world a very hard place .|0
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course, I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book's author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters.|1
"Sam O'Steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick ""Rosemary's Baby"" from 1968, here directs a quickie TV-made sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband, Roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway."|1
After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia. However, the CIA safe house is broken in by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the Agency. Alone, trusting only in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia.The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill.|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there.|1
Such pain! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. I wouldn't say this straight-to-video South African/Canadian/UK horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. I tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as I couldn't keep my eyes open.|1
Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue sucks too.|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style , because there 's absolutely no substance . the film takes place in the mid 1980s and is set in a hospital , where two people are brought in by a woman who is having an affair with the husband . then , after the first patient dies , it is revealed that the husband is actually the second patient and he is going to kill them . this is the plot and you're just left wondering how a couple of people can get so messed up . well , you just have to watch it and see .|0
"Incredibly, ""Vampire Assassin"" is significantly worse than such atrocities as ""Tequila Body Shots"" and ""Zombie Nation"" - and those movies are TERRIBLE. Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes."|1
An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada.|1
"Really ? Is this necessary ? How can somebody make such a film ? Disgusting ! ! ! Seteven Seagal's ""The Patriot"" had a similar plot line where the plot was about a group of soldiers fighting against a group of terrorists who had killed their own brother to become a god in their religion.The soldiers had to fight this god to defend the country against terrorists. But then there is another group of soldiers fighting against these terrorists. And the third group of soldiers who are also fighting the terrorist's god is also against a terrorist group but in the same way."|0
"I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as ""The Sound of Music,"" none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially amazing songs are ""Easy To Be Hard,"" ""Age of Aquarius,"" ""Hair,"" ""Flesh Failures/3-5-0-0,"" ""Walking In Space,"" and ""Hare Krishna."" Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to someday see it live!"|1
This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.Some matches were a complete waste of time.|1
If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands , the world would be in grave danger . . . Now, I don’t think this movie really is that bad. It’s certainly not a bad movie. I saw it on Netflix last night, after spending the weekend watching a lot of movies, and I’ve never been more proud of myself as a film buff than I was watching The Dark Tower. I’m not really a fan of horror movies, which is strange because they are the best genre on the planet.|0
Mount Godwin-Austin ( otherwise known as K2 ) is the world 's second highest mountain , and if the evidence is to be believed it also the highest. It is the highest of the British Isles and the highest mountain in Europe outside of Norway . The mountain is located on the Isle of Man. The summit is accessible on foot through a route that is relatively easy, although the ascent requires very good weather and a bit of luck . The climb is the most popular day-hike in Scotland. The mountain is a popular destination for hikers who like to camp, and there are many well-equipped, self-catering camp sites.|0
This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge, the Sargent, the kid, the creepy old lady, the slut, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way... never give your patient an ax! This was before Cukkos Nest, AND surpasses it.|1
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick . And of course us Americans just love our cowboy heroes, right? Well, the point is, I don't even know where to start. And I can't find a link to a trailer on youtube. And I've seen the first movie (the first I've ever seen, mind you) twice. And the movie I saw with my family, was one I've never seen. And yes, we loved it. My brother and I even cried during the movie.|0
I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!! !I did buy this film for a dollar and I've seen much worse for much more! !This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. Eight grand!!! That wouldn't pay for half a minute in Hollywood!! Nevertheless ---- This is top fun film making. If you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. These are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing.|1
The most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful, cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could've saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is, they're better actors than this movie would have you believe.|1
Frank Falenczyk: It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly.Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'You Kill Me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007.|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . I would not buy this to watch it if i had to buy it . The plot was okay , but there were times where it got to a point where you would want to quit . There are no good parts of the movie. I would give it a 0/10, but would not recommend it if you like bad movies . I did enjoy the movie because the story was very good and I thought it was pretty good .|0
I do n't care what anyone says , this movie is hilarious ! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads, with the irreverence of Zardoz , and then mixes them with an amazing musical score that will have you and your friends jumping up and down laughing. The acting and directing is superb ! I can't praise this film enough ! One of the greatest films out there ! It will be my favorite from this year. The movie is so good that I don't know how they managed to screw it up. It is the first time I felt I had heard a movie soundtrack by the movie itself.|0
Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. When jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her.|1
This movie was made on a relatively small budget ( 10-20 million dollars ? ) with almost no promotion at all. That is a pity, since the plot and acting are excellent. The plot of the film revolves around a girl who gets married to an actor and has to look after her husband after he has to leave to film some scenes for a new movie. This is an interesting film and worth a watch if you like romantic comedy films. The acting is not perfect by any means, especially in the lead roles , but it's still good to watch it.|0
"Computer savvy John Light (as John Elias) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon. But, Mr. Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to bed down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a naughty Internet sex session, Ms. Dodds shines Light on. He may lose is ""Digital Dreams"" Internet empire, too!"|1
"I just watched this, an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his ""glasses"" character on Kino Video's DVD of ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"". He's actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake séances. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are ""lost"". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits."|1
"*****Spoiler or two, not that is matters******Two things stand out about this movie. First is it's been titled both ""Bruno"" and ""The Dress Code,"" and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.Second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. The adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in."|1
"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" or any such ""deep"" concept."|1
"I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in ""Tigerland"", and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough ""leader"" character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Flash forward 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose."|1
Sorry about that . But if you have seen this `` epic '' , you will obviously know of the great work that my team and myself have been involved in building over the years. As well as a huge variety of different characters from the world of MMO's, I am very proud to have worked with the wonderful people at CCP and CCP Studios to have made a game that is as diverse as the world that they live in today . I would like to take this time and thank everyone, both past and present, for making this game a reality and allowing me to make my dreams come true .|0
"There were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly Milton Berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear ""In The Mood"" one more time I'll puke.This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her."|1
Who really wants to see that ? Disgusting violence , disgusting sex , for such a long time . I hate that . I mean that . And you know why ? It is because the people in that film , the people in that movie did it all with the eyes closed and they were dreaming of it all in their eyes , when they had it . It was like they made that film with a dream and they were looking for that movie in the movie theater or in their bed room or wherever that movie was playing .|0
I found this movie to be a big disappointment , especially considering the cast . The characters are not believable , and the plot is predictable . This movie is not the type of movie that you can simply sit and enjoy while you watch . It is not a film that will take your breath away , but it does provide enough thrills so that you won’t be able to put it down . This movie is more like a horror film , which can’t be avoided . I really wanted to like this movie , but I just didn’t .|0
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. A group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster.|1
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians, which essentially all there is to this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed.|1
Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that David was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts.|1
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road...|1
Barely came trough the whole movie ... Acting is bad , dialogs are even worse . Felt kinda st00pid 4 it . I know it wasnt the best movie but I still enjoyed it , I thought it would be interesting and fun but the acting was not in any way great , the dialogs are horrible and there is no chemistry at all between the characters , also I really didn't like the main character , he was really boring to me and I wasn't in it for at least 5 hours . I would have given it 4/5 . There's nothing special about the plot or the direction of this film.|0
Put simply , this mini-series was terrible . Let me count the ways . 1 . Absurd plotting . 2 . Poor character development . 3 . No character arc or development for any of the characters . 4 . Inappropriate dialogue . 5 . Weak acting and terrible directing . 6 . Too many pointless and unnecessary plot-points . 7 . Lackluster character development . 8 . I can go on and on . What more can I say? It is just not a great episode. I really hope that there is a Season 7. This was an okay episode.|0
Acting 10 , Script 1 . `` Hurlyburly '' is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared that there are no facts, only impressions, and that it makes no sense to try to understand the mind of a fictional character. Hence it is best to leave the audience's mind free to make its own conclusions. Acting 10 , Script 2 . `` You Can't Get Away from the Law '' was originally written and performed for the Edinburgh Festival in 1984, and then transferred to the West End of London, where it became a major hit for the next four years.|0
There 's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima ( Meiko Kaji ) , Female Scorpion , and a couple other girls at a dance club . It all started with Nami getting jealous of her friend 's new boyfriend, a man named Yuji ( Keisuke Yamashita ) . Because she knew Yuji would be interested in her friend, Nami set out to get her own boyfriend . And when she and her friend got together, she thought that she was going to get him too . It turns out, it was only the other way around , and Nami has a little trouble dealing with this .|0
"I just caught this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww , not even fun in a bad movie kind of way . the best scene is when they're on the bus and i say ""why do you drive like that?"" and ""i'm not driving in a straight line . i'm driving down the middle."" that's when it starts. it goes on until the bus is about to go over a cliff and then they just get out . i think it's great as a piece of work and i'm glad it's on in theaters ."|0
"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on ""Mystery Science Theater"" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the ""MST"" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that ""The Girl in Lover's Lane"" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1.The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting."|1
This movie is very modern and forward . It is about 75 % in English . It is aimed at people who have an interest in current topics. The movie does not have a traditional story line. The movie is made of three short stories that you have to watch separately. The movie will not give you the feeling that it is one story with a few twists. You will have to keep on watching the movie until the end for the full effect. At the end , you will have the full story in English. You will need about 2-4 hours to watch the whole movie .|0
What can I say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, needed the money. What story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. The DVD is out at the moment in the UK.|1
I won't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, Derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother.|1
"The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. She telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an ""actress"" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as Dad is 'trying to impress his boss'."|1
go get your camcorder , your little brother , and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on you , and then your mom comes home from work to find you standing at your door in your underwear asking to borrow your little brother . why are you even here on a sunday ? you are not even that important to me , and you certainly don't count in my plans for the day . you are not a big deal to me . you are more annoying than I can ever be . you aren't even worth talking to in a normal conversation .|0
Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through.|1
"As a kid, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing.I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it, instead, on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. I figured, this HAD to be better. I was wrong.The movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an ""evil wind."""|1
Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest.|1
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews . The script is poor. We have to get back the money we spent. I really think this could have been done better. What a shame! Worth a read but I'd be surprised if this book gets to be in the top 10. I'm a big fan of The West Wing, and was very excited to read the first book in the series. This is the first time I've encountered a series that's had me questioning whether they're worth reading.|0
Awful , awful , awful times a hundred still does n't begin to describe how crappy `` Biggest Loser '' was. So, here are the 5 biggest bloopers from last night's final. 5. A few of the finalists went out of their way to remind the audience they weren't the only ones to have spent a few extra pounds this week. They had to make sure they were still in contention for the $100K prize. And there were a few times when it was clear they were doing it in order to goad the judges into sending them home, too.|0
This was a nice film . It had a interesting storyline , that was executed pretty well in the later stages. I think the director had a good point to make about some of the characters. I really liked this movie and it is definitely not a horror movie but rather an action movie. It wasn't too scary and I think they could have had more of a horror element, but I liked it. The music was also very good. I would recommend this one to anyone looking for something to relax with after a hard day's work.|0
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey.|1
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around . Never has a movie surpassed the glory of Titanic. This movie was the first of the Hollywood blockbuster franchise of the 2000s . The first to use CGI effects on a mainstream Hollywood movie. The first movie of the Disney-Pixar series with an all-CG cast. The first to be released in China. It was a great, big, Hollywood blockbuster . Titanic had everything. A good plot, an exciting cast of characters , great action sequences and incredible special effects . But it was not without flaws .|0
The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is awful, the female leading actress is chubby, and the story is... wait a minute... There is no story...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to to see Piranhas, you might be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas.The only thing that I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end.|1
"I ca n't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website ! Have I been living in a dream world ? If you look at it from my perspective, a film of this type would be a very good film indeed, in the sense that if it was a real documentary, the film would have to do some kind of story, and there are several stories here. For example:

1. In many places (not all, obviously) the film documents the lives of real people. These people are not celebrities."|0
For anyone who has ever sought happiness , `` Half Empty '' is a must-see . This original cross- cultural comedy about life, love, family and the ultimate quest for happiness has the power to make you smile or cry at any given moment . . . and that can be your choice . . . . In a world where love is valued over a job or a bank balance , we find ourselves yearning to be happy and fulfilled. This is the story of one young boy's journey into self-discovery and ultimately the search for happiness for him and his family.|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake.|1
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema . On the left , there are movies made mostly for entertainment and art, while on the right you have serious works of art and documentary. Here are two of my favorite movies on the right spectrum , but they are not ‘serious’ works, they are just movies. I like watching them , I don’t need to understand what they mean, they are good just the way they are . I guess that is why I really don’t care whether or not they are true, or even whether or not they are true .|0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed?|1
"""Strike Force"" or ""The Librarians"" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie."|1
"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it."|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories.|1
'Carolina Moon ' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe spent her childhood. But she finds the people who took her in have been replaced by other people who don't even want her around. After an attempt to make a series based on the books failed in the 1990s, this film came from the screenwriters of the TV series, which had been filmed years earlier. But the story is much different from the TV series, focusing on the character of Paige, who has been living in this town for more than ten years and who never knew her father.|0
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. Sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridicious.I have seen bad acting in my day but this is NO acting. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. I hate to see his fan club.|1
This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film.|1
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing.|1
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville, FL, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order.|1
Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar . One of Hollywood 's handsome leading men . Married to fellow actor Ruth Ford , John Agar was a successful radio personality, who in 1940 became head writer on the popular ABC radio program That's My Story! Agar and Ruth married on May 2, 1941. But after a year and a half, Agar began to develop a problem with his back which caused him to be hospitalized. During the hospital stay, a surgeon found a tumor on Agar's kidney. He was operated on, and on July 25, 1942 the tumor was removed.|0
Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country , which is always the Northern part . If black people were shown this film would be burned by them , they should not go to this movie . But this film is shown by black people and so this is good . But it has some bad things too and so i will say this movie is good . So enjoy . This film is good but it is very long . If you have some time and you are not bored with this movie . This is a long movie and so i will give you the time .|0
"This really is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. The further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their ""acting"". I viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! The location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. I suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard."|1
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I would predict Andy Warhol might make--airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movie's rough, real-looking cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, yet dictating reality to the viewer. The only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device.|1
There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying.|1
Love this little film, that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown Gere/Jlo remake...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!!|1
Fun , entertaining movie about WWII German spy ( Julie Andrews ! ) falling in love with American pilot ( Robert De Niro ! ) and flying to war. The plane carrying her and her new boyfriend crashes and they both die. As Julie's plane is falling to the ground, her dying boyfriend looks into her eyes and tells her he loves her in the most beautiful words. The film was released in September 1963. It has been described by Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun Times as “a movie made almost entirely from Julie Andrews”.|0
"When a movie's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. ""Soultaker"" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.The plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be."|1
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 . It was playing in a theatre , and we saw it as soon as we walked in . As soon as we sat down and saw the previews we knew the story would be good . And it was . I don't know what I was expecting the film to be like , it was more a comedy then the plot description would have you believe . But , the movie was good and the comedy was good . It had a great cast with Bill Murray as the main character , who is a writer .|0
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it . I heard an interesting story about this film and I would like to find out if there is truth in the story or is just made up in the press. I have a few other questions for you . I have heard about the movie SCREAMERS on television when it was shown before it's release. I remember hearing about it and loved the film so I went out and bought a copy to see it. The film was released in 1982 and the film was shown in theaters in March of 1983.|0
"For the record, I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. I think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the ""geniuses"" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and MEET THE SPARTANS.I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies."|1
"Van Sant copies Hitchcock 's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets : a walkman , and nudity from both men and women. Monday, May 21, 2011

""It is a simple fact of nature that the man who is a stranger to the woman who has taken possession of him will eventually lose his respect for her. He does not want what he has got. He wants something that she does not offer, and the only way to get this is to give him the thing that she has taken possession of him."|0
the first toxie film was dark , gory , and hillarious . This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz tunes . movies , i think , need to stop being made for teenagers , and start being made for adults who know that the story isn't gonna end anytime soon . in that case , why not make a movie that's based on a novel , so people can stop waiting for films to come out that they're not actually going to like . and that's why this film does not end with the death of the protagonist or the destruction of the planet or the end of the world .|0
This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is charming as ever as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real-life author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour-guide and translator, Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a hip-hop-lovin' Ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II.|1
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy 's Scarlet Pimpernel books . Counting this one , I have read 15 books by Baroness Orczy , each with a different mystery. I absolutely love this character and would like to dedicate this post to her on her birthday and to all who enjoy her novels . The character of Scarlet Pimpernel is quite unique as he is a member of the upper-classes, well-educated and cultured with an excellent education. This makes him very intelligent and intelligent women are attracted to him and he pursues them as his future wife.|0
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary, then later felt different about it, I would return and make known my change of heart. So far, this is the first time it's happened. I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a tad surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner.|1
I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out . It did n't bother me that there was nothing to do at the beach, so I went down to San Pedro and had dinner and a drink at the Tijuana Grill . Then we went back to the hotel where the premiere was held and sat in the dark and watched. The movie looked really good, with good camera work, and some really interesting things going on behind the screen. It is a good looking movie and has one hell of an ending . . . and that ending really made it for me.|0
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Have it scripted by a 10 year old. Have the acting done by A-Level drama students faking really bad US accents (in the Isle of Man!) Add monster special effects that the lovers of B&W Dr Who shows will appreciate. Result: duff film. Throw in Samantha Janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!|1
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering in the dark. This is a very creepy movie to watch. The acting is great, even though the actors are all young teens, which is scary.The plot is pretty interesting and the whole thing is quite scary. I recommend this movie for horror, suspense, or mystery movies that are in the horror genre. This movie is rated PG-13. The MPAA rating does not reflect the video content, but the video content is not intended for people under the age of 18 (R).|0
This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of `` Next Generation '' and `` Voyager. The only reason I haven't moved on to something else is because I'm sick of these two shows. Now, with `` Next Generation '' out, the show gets a bit more interesting. The show has been on for about 2 hours and I haven't seen one scene where something is going wrong. The first few episodes are good, but by episode four and five, the show gets a lot less interesting. I agree with you that Voyager was a better show than this show.|0
"""Out to Sea"" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance."|1
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into.|1
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. Sex toys included!There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and/or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for some more glory.|1
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars.|1
This is the worst of the toxie series by far. The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. Like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. Why is this film made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. There's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop.|1
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's supposed to be a remake or update of ""The One-armed Swordsman"", by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. The script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, ""And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..."" or ""If only I'd known what a heavy price I would have to pay."" Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Sing?"|1
I , being a fan of Rupert Grint , rented this film a few months ago . I thought it was worth renting, but I would definitely re-watch it again after having seen it in a proper theater . There are few moments in this film that could make you question why the film makers didn’t choose to do something else . The opening scene is pretty standard but it doesn’t make you think . The second scene is a little bit different and I liked the idea but the execution was not good .|0
I have n't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western . Or how one commentator could call this one a B Western . It's not . If we're looking for a decent B Western this is not it . There's too much of a plot to be made and there's too little action . There's not enough onscreen gore . There's not enough nudity . I have a hard time seeing how this could be classed as a B Western as there are no guns . There are no guns in this film and they don't get used at all .|0
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The Christ. However, unlike all the others that are on offer, this one has actually been released, and it’s actually a fairly decent movie at that. The story follows Paul, who has become a Christian. He begins to have dreams which are not at all similar to those of his dreams before becoming a Christian, although he does get a glimpse of someone who looks like the Christ. It seems that he is being confronted by The Christ, but he doesn’t know it.|0
It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa!Wow. What a skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.... Just some things to point out...1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I do need counseling now.2) There is no God, there is just Dude.. I love that quote from Crow.3) Whatever did happen to the Nuns that took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach.4) Lastly, don't watch this movie un-MSTied... It has Joe Estevez as the main star.. Yikes..1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.|1
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality , although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended . the question is how far this film will have to go to justify itself as an artistic endeavor . i thought the plot was weak from the start but i was willing to suspend my disbelief so i would let it play itself out for awhile . a few key moments in this movie stand out to me though , the scene in the virtual world where the characters are being asked questions from the other side by the computer , i have never seen a single human on screen this way before .|0
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother. But when he decided to get back into the business of his youth in the late 1980's he didn't go with the obvious route of going back and trying to start from scratch. He went to his father and asked him to help him. That's what his father said to him. So Joe returned to his work in the industry that made him the big fish that he is today. And it wasn't until he made his debut that people really got to see his full talent.|0
"This movie , which I just discovered at the video store , has apparently sit around for a couple of years , waiting for a distribution deal , which never happened. Then it disappeared , because it didn't have one . When the movie finally hit the theaters , it was a complete bomb . It is, in my opinion , the worst film made this year and it will probably take at least 5 years before I revisit the genre. It isn't a good movie , by any stretch of the imagination , not even a ""bad"" movie , but the worst of the year for a very simple reason ."|0
"I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst thing I have ever seen and hope you don’t see it ever again, please let me know if I can get you a discount or if you just want to make it on DVD, but please let me know what your thoughts are! Thanks! I saw this in a class and thought it was hilarious. And yes, it’s a very funny video, that’s just my opinion though. Enjoy:

I remember seeing this on Facebook one day and it was so funny."|0
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe, so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy).|1
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made . It is a story told in a steady and measured pace . And the best of all , I like it because of its story , and it's story , it's the story of a mother and a daughter , with a mother's love , and the story of how two young lovers meet , and how that daughter becomes to love her mother as she loves her daughter . This movie was one of the best movies ever made . A wonderful film , a very good film .|0
"Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and ""funny"" a show can be. Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were insufferable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this)."|1
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film . Trouble is , the content could have been better , but this movie was still a pretty decent movie . There were a couple of plot holes , which i guess had to do with the fact the movie was based on chess games . The chess theme was used in one scene, but it was not explained in the movie . That would have been cool . I have to say this movie is really an excellent piece of film-making. It’s a great movie in many aspects.|0
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role.|1
"I'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and I love this movie.It's no ""Mystic River."" It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he's good in this. So are Julianne Nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!"|1
"The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That's the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of ""liberties"" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable. )The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area."|1
If you loved the 1993 ( erotic , sci-fiction ) cyborg film `` Nemesis '' , then you 'll love the 2005 film version of it. It is a true remake of the 1987 film, which is a sequel to the 1983 movie. I did not see the 1983 movie, and I don 't plan to get to see it. I would say it is not a good film. It does not make sense. I will try to make my point. The plot of the 1987 movie is as follows: An alien spacecraft crashes near Earth, which kills most of the astronauts on board.|0
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like ""Waterworld"" than anything else. I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like ""hoist the mainstay!"""|1
"Yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny. ""Night Hunter"" is basically about Jack Cutter, a Vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires.This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes."|1
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of Richard Pryor.I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform.|1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production . Martha Coolidge herself said she only did a half of the sex scenes with the men she was working with . It does have a good storyline with a nice ending . It would probably be a good idea to make a new version and make a sequel but that would not be wise . The original movie was in colour . A new one in colour would cost around 10 times more than the film . It would be good to do a second version for television .|0
"This is an interesting , hard to find movie from the early 70 's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a cop. It was made in France but is a French film, which makes sense. The main character is a French cop. There are some very cool shots and some really cool music in the movie . There are a number of memorable lines , such as , ""You have to talk to these guys and tell them I have to stay here."" , and I have to go into a little detail with this one because this is a movie I have had some trouble locating for some strange reason."|0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game , HUGE fan . It still holds a place in my heart, it just doesn't make sense. You don't know what's going to happen in the future. You have no control. All you can control at this point is your own actions in the moment. And sometimes you're in control of a bad guy and you have to make tough choices. You have to get to a good place as soon as possible in order to survive. There isn't enough time to think things over.|0
"""Cat In The Brain"" is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director Lucio Fulci's most notorious years of film-making. The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than that, he casts himself as the star, the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. ""Cat in The Brain"" is not about presenting a clear story and following it."|1
Man , I ca n't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . Okay , it sure doesn't have all the great elements of any of my favorite sci-fi movies , but i would have to agree that it is a good example of what a good SF film is. I like that they were able to get a group of people who didn't seem to fit together , but ended up together. I don't see how that would happen in most films, and I think it's a big plus for a story like this one.|0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles.|1
I haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie is one HUGE non-sequitur! It is an affront to the noble B Western films of the '30's. I have seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.The bad guy is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches.|1
The Mummy's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one. Kharis and his mate Ananka both end up in the bayous of Louisiana, and on his resurrection, he searches out his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana isn't made entirely clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders.The Mummy's Curse was watchable, but it really wasn't anything special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I'd seen this before.|1
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. Non The main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage.|1
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever . i fell bad for all the actors and actresses and it just had me laughing so bad at the ending . i just couldn't believe what the director and producers was doing with the story . it was so stupid and stupid that i felt i needed to tell everybody i met that was watching it , i told my friends about it and they didn't believe me and told me to shut up !!!! !!! ( i couldn't understand it . i had to read and re-watch and then go back and re-watch it .|0
"When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it ""the greatest achievement in the history of the American cinema."" That was not wholly tongue in cheek. TW&TL remains Milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. However, TW&TL remains a striking exposition of what once was known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's superb portrayal of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius--and Keith--admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including ""The Rough Riders."")"|1
In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950 's . Leon , the leader of the gang , is betrayed and killed . One of his sons moves in with the father who is now a member of the rival gang . This leads to all kinds of problems and misunderstandings as the boys have to sort out who the real man of the house is and who has his back . There is one scene that is just amazing , that of the father leaving the mother's house for his home , with all the girls on his arm and his daughter with him in his arms .|0
Originally , the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial , and it shows . I dislike serials ; they don't read , they don't hold my interest , they're dull , they just don't have enough . I didn't like the last two serials in this series , so I was a little concerned that the new one would be just the same . The story was interesting enough , so I was happy to see that the first half was well written and enjoyable . The second half of the story didn't live up to it's potential , but it was good enough to be worth the watch .|0
"The most amazing film I have ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw. I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U.S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way."|1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate . My nieces have watched it non-stop since they 've been born . My daughter is going to watch it as well . She's only 4 months old and already knows who she is. I really enjoyed the movie and have seen every version ever made . The kids in this movie make me laugh out loud so much because of them . I know I've been watching the same ones since I was young. This is one of my fav movie's . I wish this movie would go to an animated one .|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created . Far Cry 5 is set in present day Kyrat and follows the story of Far Cry, where you are on the front line as the only hope of protecting mankind from the alien threat . Far Cry 5 is due to start production in February 2018 and is set to release on March 20, 2018 . It features a return of the popular Far Cry series, and a brand new franchise that will take Far Cry 5 in an entirely new direction, while bringing the game back to life.|0
This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.|1

As a result, they end up with very little and no money to make it to their next stop, so they take to hitch hiking until they can make their way to the nearest port. On their journey they meet an old lady who has lost all her belongings and is looking for a ride. They also run into another couple hitchhiking.|0
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) in order to get an emotional reaction out of the audience by creating a story that has an emotional meaning and that has to do with the emotions of the moviegoer. I’m going to list down some movies here that I like and that I’ve watched, that try to do something different in terms of the film and its story. They try and fail miserably at it because they don’t know how to create any kind of story.|0
Dreadful , stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be in on it , even the mayor , the sheriff , the state treasurer ,and the governor , the state comptroller , the US post office , and the sheriff . There is a lot of talking in this movie , most of it is useless talk , but there were some good things , like a speech by one of the lumber bosses that was just plain funny . The lumber industry of the 19th century was very much like Hollywood in the 30's .|0
"This film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but ""Sweet and Lowdown"" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable, that I do not want to now about him, or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore."|1
I hope the writer , director , editor , and composer ( and let 's not forget producer ) read and understand this and understand how the movie is going to work , so that they can take the proper time and make this movie into an art house movie . This is the second time I have watched this. I enjoyed this movie , I was surprised at how good it was . The movie has a great plot , very well done acting by most of the cast and I liked the acting from the rest of the cast .|0
OH MY God I am lost Now I know everything this guy does is Pointless R J A wrote at 4/5/2013 8:12:00 PM, they’re not going to stop because I am not going away, it’s the way he makes it seem you have to be a member to get in. They won’t shut me down, I’m already in. RJ, you’re in. I know everything. They know I know everything, I’m going to tell them about your new girlfriend when they come for me. When will you come for me RJ?|0
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as I could but this one I felt was so below par not only for Hitch's films - aw heck, I'm being far too nice here. This pictured really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carole Lombard, but I have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey.|1
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the 'Battle of the Tough Guys'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably.|1
"When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book ""Het Gouden Ei""/the movie ""Spoorloos""(outside Holland, this movie has the name ""the Vanishing"" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that 'the American Audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free."|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. The jokes where really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about Mongolian history, traditions etc. My co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost.|1
Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've ever seen ! `` The Beginning '' was not the greatest either. I don''t have an opinion on the movie or the book. I just didn''t really care. I was going to go to the movies tonight, then I realized it was Friday. I would probably go to the movies at some other place. What is it with movies and Friday? Oh wait... This movie is so awful that I really can''t think why they made it. Maybe they think we don''t care about the people in it.|0
I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on . While not as bad as the original series of Battlestar Galactica, it does have the same kind of feel, with the constant struggle between the humans and an alien menace that seems to come and go. I was watching to see if my son would like it, and he liked it a lot . He didn't have much of a problem with the story line, and said he enjoyed how they always seemed to come up with more ways to win rather than just kill the aliens.|0
Altioklar : Master of the thieves . Watch some movie , steal some parts of them , write a script for them . Make an epic series and publish them. You can make as much money from each movie as you do from each blog. Just like you make money from your website by selling banner ads, and then you resell the ads at a low price. That's the principle of advertising, you get paid the price of your advertising and then resell the ad space to make more money. Just make a blog that will attract people who are willing to pay money for your books or movie.|0
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Small Soldiers and Big Sky. This is a great movie, but that's about as close to the end as we get. This is one of those movies I've never seen in the theater, but would watch if someone was to bring me to it. I was a little nervous to see it, because I didn't know what to expect. I'd never seen any of David's movies before.|0
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . The acting , directing and script are all dreadful . I hope the producer is sued , and the makers of this abominable film have a few very very very long and very nasty years to live. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, but this one is not the worst. There is a lot to dislike, but it is quite entertaining. But, as you will find out in the review, you are going to have a difficult time watching this movie on a large screen with a sound system.|0
Historically awful. Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. Events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. Likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics.|1
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival . Since I work in the wine business , I found the film interesting because of what it had to say about wineries and wine. But I was not really impressed. It seems to me it would be more interesting if they had just shown a video or taken some pictures to show what makes a wine unique. I was not impressed with the film because they were showing wine that was not available to be shown. I wish they had shown the wine that they actually had in the film or even better, in the actual winery .|0
Contains Major Spoilers, on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid.Predictable schlock from the start, and if that weren't enough, the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been. For example: will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dim as we go to a commercialand the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane!|1
"Don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier film . It`s not because this is a pointless re- film . That is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the "" remake "" of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago . The scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( But with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be thankful ."|1
