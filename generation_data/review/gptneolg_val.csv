In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally rendered the narrative more readable. However , the book has its flaws , not least because of its author , who has little regard for his readers' intelligence . The book opens with an explanation of the title and a summary of the plot . The first section is a prologue and offers some background to the novel . It then follows the action , the events which lead up to Wilde's death, the funeral , and Wilde's burial .|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more than what i expected . What's interesting is that they filmed it on a movie-size camera. While I am not a filmmaker, I thought it would be interesting. I was surprised at first that the whole thing took so long to film. It looked like they were trying to capture the show as it was going on . I had to turn the TV off , turn it back on to see if they got any of that action. The show is good, not great.|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one to have the three stars in the picture . This film was released on November 13,1933 and was directed by Allan Dwan . The film stars John Wayne , Spencer Tracy , Fredric March and George Brent . This is one of few movies to have Wayne and Tracy in the same movie and the only movie to have Wayne and March play in the same film . There were two versions of this film , the first one was an early talkie and it was shot at the Astoria Studios in the city of Astoria , Oregon .|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's about to put it on a boat for Brazil , to be sold . The captain of the train , told the passengers , that he will put them in jail . Clayton , however, is going to put them in a boat , and that boat is going to be in the Atlantic Ocean , far away from any country of the world . Clayton , who wants to make $ 500,000 in a few days , wants the gold .|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and I liked the fact that the man had to come back every time someone wanted to talk about the situation that he was in, but in the end he knew the answer and got on with his work. That was a good episode. Nice to have a character who can see both sides of all the situations in the show. But I don't know if we will get many more of them in the future.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and this girl is so hot. She has the body of an angel. When I went to meet her, I was so surprised by her, I thought she was going to be like the next girl in the magazine, with the most amazing tits , long legs and very hot smile. That is until I took a look in her eyes. You can tell she is the real deal. And what I found was a very sweet, caring person.|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning , and a visual treat . I would watch it again any day. I loved this movie from beginning to end. I really loved the story line, it was well written and acted. I felt like this movie was like an oldies rock n roll movie. It was really well written with great songs in it. I would give this movie five stars if possible. It was a very good story that did have good music to go with it.|0
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying it, or why, but I always end up being disappointed. But today I'm ready for the next game, and I can't seem to stop buying it after each game. I know I don't have much time left to make up my mind, but it seems like a waste not getting a sequel. My favorite games of this year have been Metal Gear Solid V and Super Smash Bros Brawl, but I'm going to give Just Before Dawn my second chance.|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most prolific periods of comic book writing. In his early years, his stories were published under the name Jack Davis. As time passed, he would be known by his new name, Jerry Siegel, which would appear on most of his comics covers and most of his letter head. It wasn't until his early 60's that he began his association with DC Comics. It wasn't until the mid 70s when he began his association with Marvel.|0
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as detective fiction. A number of books were published dealing with murder mysteries, but the most popular of the detective novels during this period were those with female protagonists. These were usually about women who were involved in criminal enterprises, sometimes against their own men. The first of this type was Miss Marston. Published in 1929, Marston, an American woman living in the United States, wrote The Woman in Black, the story of a woman who commits a murder.|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
"Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats just my opinion ! __________________
‚ÄúYou are not your words, I am your words and everything you do flows out of them. You think you know me, but you have to see me and know who I am to truly love me. ‚Äù

Who wrote it ? I am a great admirer for this film since I saw it during the first season on a movie channel. This was the best time for me when my passion of cinema began !"|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either a very positive one or a negative one, some are very positive, others not so much. I thought to myself, I've seen the movie, I've got to see how I did. I guess I'm a little biased, I'm not biased at all really, I just thought it was interesting to see what people thought of it. For those who've never seen it, I will give you my impressions.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this , I can say I've learned a thing or two about prison violence. This film shows the violent side of prison life . And it's also a good lesson on race relations in New York City . I'm not going to give away what happened in the movie so if you don't like watching the film, don't get mad at me . If you're like me, this film makes you want to see it again .|0

"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the first day. For some it was the first kiss with their best friend, or the first night at a party where they fell for someone they barely knew. For others they have gone through a relationship that ended badly and now they are alone in their dreams of love again. And for a few of us they are the first love of our life. I am talking about love that we are in our teenage years now, just starting out.|0
"Clich√©-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story ¬ñ ""It's about an astronaut and his dog . . . ""[1] you can be pretty sure you are in store for one of those films that is at least half-hearted. And even then it is often only halfhearted. You know the film is going to be great if the writer/director gives you the opportunity to hear an interesting story but is forced to keep you interested for less than half an hour and the film ends with no real impact."|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in many different ways. I was moved by it because it is one of my all time favorite books; I have also seen the movie a number of times, and I will continue to go to see the film as well. And there is so much to love about the story itself, about the characters and the way the story ends. I would like to give you some of my notes from the novel, and hopefully some insights and thoughts you can find useful.|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student of the world. It is a very rare breed, which is hard to imagine. We have met one of them in the film : a man from the village who has been dreaming to go abroad, to study to become a doctor . He has just graduated from school with good grades and now is doing his Masters. He lives with his wife and his son who is in his first year in high school.|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed it). So I thought to myself: I'll watch it again! The thing is that, after a week, I still loved this film. But I realized that it had lost its magic, at least as far as my perception of it goes, so I decided to watch it again. And now I'd like to tell you why I think this was a good film, at the risk of boring you with all the 'facts'.|0
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , a certain amount of bloodshed in movies would result from slasher movies. It may have been more likely that it would be the same amount of bloodshed than if they were in other genres. However, there are still horror movies that have no blood. There are also movies that have no nudity. But that doesn't mean there is no nudity. It may just mean you can't see it with the eyes of God. It just means you won't have to see it in the mirror.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio for an upcoming album (which, incidentally, is called Karen Carpenter , the same way it was when the film was first released), and one of them (or maybe it's both of them, it's unclear) mention that Karen is going on tour, even though the film was only a few months old and the album she's working on was completed a couple of years prior. That's the moment where the movie gets its nickname: The Karen Carpenter Story .|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few ) should actually do a little research on the show and why they think it should be bad. They are not the only people who make bad reviews and it makes it even harder for other reviewers and viewers to understand why. If they do that, maybe they could be the only ones. It has nothing to do with the story and it has to with the show not having a good enough cast. The cast is very diverse and some of them are actually really good looking.|0

Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. The movie is well made; it‚Äôs just that the director doesn‚Äôt have the talent to make good slashers. The characters seem a bit thin; the action is slow paced; there‚Äôs nothing original or new to say, and there isn‚Äôt much humor to make up for the lack of energy on the screen. I do believe this movie is a cult classic, however, as many people that I know went to see it multiple times after it first came out.|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a comedy but the humor is very sweet and sweet-natured . The script , by Robert Towne , is very good . It's based on a very well written novel by Arthur Laurents . The book is about a husband who discovers he has fallen in love with a married woman . After some time , they get engaged . She has a little girl . When they go on a trip , their son , played by Alan Alda , comes along for the ride .|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1

"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my Ass. I didn't like this one At all. Review:

Kane, Kane and Kane is one of those movies you just can't not like, it is so much fun. I really like the way the characters are written and their relationships are shown, it flows very well. The characters are great characters and I really love watching them develop. I was a little worried the movie could get boring, but no, it is really great."|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I‚Äôve read have been a little on the lukewarm side of positive or positive at best. There have been a few I‚Äôve read in which the positive reviews seem like they‚Äôve come from people who want to watch the film but don‚Äôt know where or how to get it. That‚Äôs why I wanted to write about Donnie Darko: I watched the film over the summer and while it‚Äôs a solid piece of cinema I found myself thinking ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?|0
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life and fantasy that we can't help but like. The story revolves around a young girl who discovers a strange artefact she can't explain. Her new life in the world of magic is going to be a difficult one as it becomes apparent that the powers of her new friends and allies are a lot more powerful than they seem to be. There's also the issue of her parents' love life, and her growing attraction to a handsome stranger.|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't take over the boxoffice . I think it has it's own unique charm and it had it 's share of hick jokes . There are some funny bits , but it wasn 't so funny . You can tell the makers of this movie are trying hard not to offend anybody . At the same time , they have to make it entertaining . The movie itself has some great performances , great direction and some great production values . It's a big movie .|0
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 so I couldn't really make the connection with it... but I remember liking it. I still have a hard time visualizing it, so I thought I would share it here for anyone that wants to watch it. The film starts out like a horror film... with a few scenes in the hospital. Then it all goes in a different direction and the film becomes more of an 'out of body experience.'|0
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (besides raise me) was get us to go see that movie when we were young. It was the second time my dad had us go see something that really made a difference in how I saw and thought and felt about the world. I don't remember anything in the book, but the movie gave me a very different view of my own life that I thought I knew. It made me think very differently about myself, my family, and life.|0
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a man but also a woman‚Äôs mind of the 20th Century . not only do they both take us on such a voyage, but they do so with the same breath and the same passion . they are the perfect marriage of art and literature , of imagination and history , of artistry and insight . and for me it is a joy to discover such a beautiful and complex artist as dostoevskij , not only in the pages of his work but also in our own minds .|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly enjoyed. I didn‚Äôt realize it when I watched the film in its entirety, only when I was finishing the last scene. That‚Äôs a funny movie. On a similar note, I‚Äôm going to post a short interview I had with my former boss. She told me that when I was still working with her on her film, she told me ‚ÄúWhen you finish the film, you can take all the credit.‚Äù And I agree with her.|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. When I first watched it I couldn't put it down . I'm not sure I can ever watch it again. It just has so much potential to be one of the better horror movies ever made . I'm glad I went in blind so I could watch it again. The performances by the main cast are good , the director does a great job directing and the movie does a great job at showing what could have been a very good horror flick.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile moments that we must live with if we want to reach our full potential . I have no problem admitting I'm a little crazy when I think about my past . But in all my crazy moments I think of a few people that were important to me . One was my parents . the other was my grandfather . Both of them had an important role in shaping the person I am now . They had a huge impact on the way I view and think about things .|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagree¬óthis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling¬óit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which they go for a long drive . A guy sits in the back seat with a girl sitting on his lap . He pulls her down on top of him and she takes her panties off and puts them in his lap . The next day he finds out she has taken his pants off . After that they have a fight and she gets a restraining order . Then they have sex and he ends up going to jail .|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch it. I am not a film critic. I have never been a film critic. But I love movies and I am a film lover and that is why I am here. I have been a movie lover since my childhood when I used to watch old horror movies in the late night. Those are the movies I have been following the most of late. I have been a movie fanatic since my childhood.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice story , nice acting , good effects , great music . Just not the best movie i ever seen . i would like to hear some more reviews on this movie i would also like to know if the movie had any other plot twists . This was definately a great film and one of the best of this decade . I liked the film very much and would recommend it to anyone! The story was good, the script and dialogs were funny, the acting was good and the action was very good.|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must live . The film had a great chance to succeed as a horror film but the story, writing and direction made it not that good. I know this movie will be watched by many but it had a hard time to find success . If you want to watch horror film , this is the one to watch . I love the story line. I would recommend you to give it a watch and if you still want more of it , then read my review and let you know .|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a video for the occasion of my recent trip to New Mexico to attend the New Mexico Military Institute. The New Mexican cowboys are well-organized and well-rewarded individuals. I was surprised by the level of discipline they exhibit. I had a great time, and learned a few things that are probably applicable to our work with the troops in Iraq. Thanks a million to the NMI for allowing me the pleasure of meeting you all, and to Mario and the other cowboys of New Mexico for making the trip so fun.|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Upstairs At The White House'' novel. The story begins, as with the best of the best books, in a small Southern town, with a father and son as the center of attention, and ends, as with most of Conroy's best books, on a beach, in a state of nature, far away from his home in upstate New York. It may have been inevitable, however, that the book would have its critics.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I didn't like it. I guess I still don't really like it. There is some great things in it, but they are overshadowed by some not so good things. The first 2 hours is a great start to the movie, and it is a really good start at showing how the characters work. The problem is the rest. Story: The movie has been out for a long time now, yet the story has not really changed.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully ridiculous movie, in the tradition of Harold Ramis movies, but it‚Äôs even more amusing than the Harold. And it‚Äôs a little too long and silly, in the tradition of many of those movies. But if you give yourself over to laughter and silliness then you realize this is a pretty clever film. I‚Äôll let you get to that. I saw it on a Monday night, and went to see it three nights later, when it was released by Lionsgate.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but I still think it's a classic movie. I love everything about this film. I saw this movie on VHS, it has been so long that I don't know if I will ever find a DVD of this movie. If you still have a copy, or you saw this movie on video in the 1990s or early 2000s, do yourself a favor and rent or buy this movie today. This movie is so great that I reccomend to anyone who loves a movie.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the best comedy in the whole world and it is very well written . The King of Queens is a story that is funny and touching to many people . If you like comedy you will like this , and if you like comedy , you should watch the show . But I want to say this show is about a woman who is married to a married man , but she has a boyfriend who is a married man and he really like the idea of her having someone else as her love in life .|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of the horror films from the last five or six years have been lame , but this was by far the best horror film in recent years . The acting and special effects are quite good , the storyline is very well developed . I was not disappointed in the movie , so if you are looking for a decent horror movie , get this movie . It is not the first slasher movie from this author , so check it out , it is a very good film .|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
"Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my liking) . Very good , well shot movie with good acting . The ending was quite good , a little bit of twist at the end . A good movie in every sense of the word . RATING: 3.5 (Good); 2.5 (Better); 1.5 (Best)

The other day, I saw this movie in a theater in the West Village. It's been on my mind ever since."|0
"This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I remember thinking that if I ever made a video I would include the movie, which is a very odd thought now . The film is about two young boys trying to catch a big fish , and their journey to get it . There is no fish in this movie , it's all about chasing after the kids who want to make a new friend . The movie opens with , "" You may have heard about a kid who wants to make a friend."""|0
"Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired ). This one has been long in the works for many a year. I am pleased to say it is now on my DVD collection. Enjoy . From the film's Wikipedia article:

Cabin in the Woods (2013) was directed by Adam Green and is a live-action adaptation of the novel Cabin in the Woods by Stephen King. It was released as a direct-to-dvd/Blu-Ray on November 25, 2013, by Lions Gate Films, in 3D, DVD, and VOD formats."|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , I would love to know where it is in Europe ). I think it was a great film and really funny - not much more I would have liked to have known. I enjoyed the film and I am still in love with the theme song and the ending. I thought that it was really good and that I would like to work in the same company as the actors. When I first saw this movie I was impressed, but then I saw it a year later and I was disappointed with it.|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the late 19th century, New York is a hotbed of sexual depravity. Nurse Betty‚Äôs medical skills have gotten her into enough trouble to keep her out of the gutter. But when she catches her employer engaged in an illicit love affair, Nurse Betty is forced to step out of her role as a nurse and embrace her true calling ‚Äî that of a sex therapist! And with that, Nurse Betty enters a new and dangerous world of erotic pleasures and forbidden desire.|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to grace me with its presence in print. And now I‚Äôm sharing this cartoon with the world as a free digital download. And what better time than now for this cartoon? The whole thing is just so hilarious. There is even an explanation of how it all came about at the bottom of the page, plus I‚Äôm going to be showing it to you in a whole different way now by adding all of my favorite lines and pictures to the comic itself.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should get out of the movie business and just show old movies and old cartoon movies . I think people don't care anymore , but they do and I would watch it anyway. It was my favorite movie as a kid and when my kids saw it we would watch it together . Now it's a classic . It still has all the old characters . I don't think there is anything in it that has been changed . I agree that it is a classic.|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could not do enough to make you laugh , smile or cry . I hope to see you there . . I want to give a big THANK you to the entire cast, crew and all involved for making a truly wonderful performance. I can't imagine how lucky I was to see it . This show is just the best and I was fortunate enough to have a wonderful time with this amazing cast. I'm sure I'll be seeing them on the stage again .|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
Michelle , Anic√©e Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died on May 2nd , 2011 , and left behind a son . He is so cute ! I met with her a few months before her passing , she was very sweet , and so caring . I love the way that she wrote her book . I would like to get her book of poetry . Thank you for making my day , and I hope that you make my day in a positive way . Blessings to you and your family and all your loved .|0
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals in Europe, including BFI London, and it had been invited to be screened in the US. '' Film critic Roger Ebert later wrote that '' the film is a masterpiece . It is one of only two films that I've ever been able to make the effort to see twice in the same night''. He described the film's style as '' almost surreal in the way that it uses non-human actors on stage and then has the audience react to them.|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis, but I still like to have them, just as a precaution. So far I have seen the first two chapters, here's the link for the last two chapters on Google Drive. So far I haven't read either of them, just looked on Google Drive to get this summary. I am sure they are interesting, but I am also sure there is a lot of material left to be written.|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange trip and it turns out that the film we saw in Paris the week before the trip is now in France. We're in Paris. And it turns out that they're selling copies. So we went into a little shop and there was the film and the English translation of the film. They were selling those as well. And then in the shop the man behind the counter told us about it. That the movie is available in France as well.|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. This is truly a film to be savored, for the first 40 minutes, or so, you will have no other choice than to enjoy it, for you will never know what it will do to you, or how it will change you. This is also a film that you must see. It‚Äôs not about politics or religion or social change. It‚Äôs about a story, a tragedy, a tragedy that is the most profound, the most profound that one can have.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that I was watching it. The first was at a Christmas party about 9 years ago (I remember it as a very weird movie) , the second was last year (not that I ever got to it), and after a very long break, this time. And I'm really glad I finally managed to watch it . It's a great movie and a lot of fun. I didn't know what to think of the ending - I thought the movie could have been a bit funnier.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways , I can identify with what the filmmakers want to say through their characters . But where this film really shines is in its editing and cinematography , as well as the acting by the main cast and some fantastic set-ups . For the film to have such a low rating , in my opinion , was a shame and a travesty , as it truly has the potential to be much more than simply a standard romantic comedy .|0
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , who has been performing solo for over 20 years , was in great voice, playing a lot of the hits and many of their newer songs . I hope he will return to performing with ' s new line up . The performance was very enjoyable, with many of the hits being played very well . The band played many of their songs with the right amount of energy . It was nice to see the members playing together for the first time , and to watch them interact and interact with the audience .|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest, with the same tired plot devices and predictable characters that have defined these genre movies. But then we watch the first few seconds, and we see that these are not '80s slashers! Instead, we are in a film that is not at all like the films of the same genre we've grown to love. This film looks and sounds different! This is not a slasher film. This is a comedy. When the film opens, it's the early evening hours of New Year's Eve.|0
"Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's why we have a need for a new foreign policy that will be different than what we've had for years, but that 's not what the Democrats are offering. We have a need for a new foreign policy that's going to be different and I believe we can get that, but not at the cost of letting the left wing radicals hijack our government for decades to come and destroy the country from within."""|0
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . There are several ways to look at those classics . Some people say that they don't go out of their way to try to collect them . What they don't want is to go back to them to watch them . There are also people who say they have already seen them , or have already seen a better one . And there are people who never watched them . I'll just say what I think. My opinion is that we can't go back in time to see those classics .|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc, which gave me the same impression I got when watching the film - this was a film about a man who used his experience as a mental patient to become a writer, and made some interesting observations about the way we think about mental illness and our society's view of mental illness and how this affects society's view of mental illness. It seems to me that he's talking about a world in which mental health services are provided free for anyone who really needs them - for free.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about this movie. I love this movie. This is a great movie with an awesome plot, and a great twist at the end. This is truly a great movie, with a very good twist at the end . The acting is very good as well. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again. I will watch this movie this year. Thanks for sharing this awesome movie. I really enjoyed it, and this is truly a great movie.|0
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years , until a French restorer found it while cleaning in Paris. But just because it‚Äôs old doesn‚Äôt make it rare. What is rare is actually finding the Mona Lisa. That‚Äôs right. If you‚Äôve got a little time to spare, and you have the right tools, and you know how to find the Mona Lisa , you can become the next world-class finder of the most famous painting in the world.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie or Scarlett and Rhett , as if the characters aren¬ít gone ¬ñ the show has been an essential part of the drama in the world of the Shakespeare plays since its first episode. But as the curtain is raised on this fall ¬ñ as well as another new series, ‚ÄúThe 100,‚Äù starring ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù star Aaron Paul, as well as this year¬ís ‚ÄúDownton Abbey‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Knick‚Äù ¬ñ PBS is looking for ways to reinvent itself in a more user-friendly format for viewers.|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. Written in 1915, the film is set in an old western town where a man is hired to take care of his young wife's family. John Ford was born in Indiana in 1881, and his parents were both farmers. He was raised during a time when movies were a major part of his childhood, and he was determined to become a successful movie star. He attended the University of Minnesota where he was exposed to acting, but he was also involved in his first western.|0
Clich√©-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story ¬ñ Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona ¬ñ you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The show follows the story of a murderer in the midst of solving his latest murder, which may or may not be his most recent. The narrative is split into two separate sections, one set within the killer's mind, the other outside. In each section we follow the killer's actions as they unfold, which lead us through the crimes he has committed. It's not a linear story but instead, as we progress further along the show's timeline, it becomes a very compelling mystery.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. And, in this particular film, it definitely shaped my opinion of the star. I had never even heard of him before I watched the movie . I didn't even think he was a celebrity until I saw this film , and that's because I know what I know about celebrity. I knew very little about celebrities and I knew even less about him. I watched this movie about four times and I couldn't stop thinking about it.|0
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a lot of impressions. This is not meant to be a review , merely a list of impressions from a film I loved in a foreign culture. (The film is called ‚ÄúThe Great Wall‚Äù in Japanese, I think this is an apt title for the film, because the film looks at the concept of a wall separating two cultures. This wall is a physical barrier , so there is no ‚Äúgreat wall‚Äù in reality.)|0
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances ¬ñ though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains ¬ñ you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one ¬ñ both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite movies during the early '50s, and as such, it has long gone out of circulation on VHS and DVD, even in Europe. This was the second feature from director George Pal, who had worked on films like . The plot, like all of Ford's films, was heavily influenced by John Ford, but Pal was his own director, who used his own cast and crew to produce a story that he would make into one of the most influential of Ford movies.|0
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. It scared me because it was a movie I was not able to understand and I had no one to talk to. I found out after seeing it in an art house theatre with a friend in the audience and we were having a discussion about it that it was really good and that it would be worth paying for a ticket just to see this movie. I don't believe the movie was better than other films from the same era and even today I think it is a very good movie.|0
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception. I am very happy for my son to watch it and hope it will bring him good. The actors and the actresses are great. This review contains spoilers, click expand to see them. This is a re-imagined version of MESSIAH that should be viewed as a sequel to the original. The original series followed the adventures of the main character, Messiah, played by actor Jeremy Irons, while this one follows Messias‚Äô grandson, Jadon, and his father Messias.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic musical with amazing costumes, sets and dancers. I loved how it was performed on stage and I loved that there were costumes on stage that I had not seen before. I loved how it was not just a dance but a celebration of music. I loved the songs that they performed but I also liked how they included many songs that you could sing and dance along with. It is truly a great show that is great entertainment and has great entertainment value for the entire family.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, he is left to make things right at home alone. Gillian Flynn‚Äôs darkly comic novel begins with a young man on a dangerous assignment to find a young woman who has been kidnapped by an evil group. The mission leads Gregory Peck and Gig Young on a most unexpected and treacherous journey, and when their paths cross again at a party, the two are left to deal with an old friendship at home.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now and just start the 4th one. I decided to give it a chance and try it out. And I think I liked this one more than the other 2 I watched. The first one had some funny moments. I can see how others would not like it all but for me, it was funny. I enjoyed this one better than the last 2 . The jokes were funny, even if it was a bit over the top in some parts.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) , I thought i'd go back over the songs and reevaluate my opinion on them , because i had a few questions . First off , why does he only play the same songs , over and over , every year ? Second , what's so special about the songs that they always play the same ? Anyway , i'm looking at some of the songs for the 5th time . I've been using my ipod to play them , and I'm trying to make them more accessible .|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , well acted , creative , and heartwarming . It won an award for the best animated movie of 1993 . And now we finally have a trailer for Nurse Betty . It is a very short trailer that gives a preview of what the full movie would be like . There is no real plot or plot synopsis , but it shows the main events and some of the characters . And it gives a very nice idea of what the movie would have looked like .|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this group is truly first rate. They play everything they record with no filler and they don't care if anyone else likes the record. This band is by far the best live band i've been able to find for the price. They perform the most original material I have seen them play in ages. If you ever get a chance, buy these guys. They are true class acts and if you like music you should buy their albums as soon as they come in.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit , that is one of the worse ones). This movie is basically set in the old world of Mel Brooks . It is about a bunch of old rich white folks going to a cabin , to enjoy some peace and quiet from the madness of the modern world. They spend the entire movie going to the cabin , drinking beer , going to the bathroom , playing darts , arguing politics , etc . This movie is very very funny .|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has made movies with some of the best actors in Hollywood, but at the end of the day, I always go back and see the classic movies that he has done that have stood the test of time , so I was so excited to see Men in Tights . When you see a movie like this where Mel Brooks is doing something so brilliant, it makes it easy to forget that he is in any other movie of his. It makes you appreciate him a little more .|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how the most beautiful country in the western hemisphere is also one of the most beautiful in the world, with its own style, music, food, and customs. Alfredo Molina was born in 1948 in a small farming family. He joined the army at 15 and served in various combat units in the military during the ‚Äô60s, and the ‚Äò70s, and he went through his own personal journey as an anti-Castro rebel, and a member of an armed group.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational , I can't resist pointing out some of the other aspects of this one . you know what I mean ? ) , and I can say that this film does nothing to disprove that notion . all of the chains , no matter what type and length of chain , are made of plastic , but there's more than meets the eye here . you know how they say that there are more than six billion plastic bags in this world , most of them never get to the landfill , but still ?|0
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool twists and turns, but one thing stood out more than any other: this is one of the best and most beautiful love stories Ive ever read. This story has a good amount of humor sprinkled throughout, which really helped it along. While the story was a bit too long, it was well written and I could feel the emotion that the author was trying to evoke. The ending I liked most, I just wish it would have been a little longer.|0

Dating in India: An Overview

India, also known as Bharat is a landlocked country in the south-eastern part of Asia. It is located on the southeast coast of the Indian subcontinent, and is made up of seven major regions, namely, the coastal belt, Northern India, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi state, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, which in turn fall under the Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala administrative divisions."|0
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings an all-new American Western to life in this epic tale, set in Texas during the years after the Mexican-American War. Ford‚Äôs ‚ÄúWagon Master‚Äù is a sweeping epic that captures the excitement and drama of the West before it was Western. In the film‚Äôs opening scene, we are treated to a stirring and emotional scene between two men. As a man and a boy, they gaze out at the beauty of the Texas Hill Country.|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and I am glad it came out on Blu-Ray, I have only seen one of their earlier DVDs and it is not worth buying , and this is one of the best. There are many reasons I like it as I think it will be worth the purchase for the full experience, this documentary is not just a look back at the 60s and the 70s. It is also not just a look back at Elvis Presley, but looks at many others as well.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me can‚Äôt wrap my brain around the fact that the whole film is actually a metaphor. But I can. As with the first film in the series, `` Snake-Eared Freaks ,'' the first shot of the new movie is a snake eating a dog. It‚Äôs the scene that starts it all. This time, though, it‚Äôs in slow-motion. The camera pans to a black-and-white photo of a snake and dog and then stops on a close-up of the snake‚Äôs open mouth.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! ! ! i love all the films !!!! i have seen many movies in my life !! but i still love all my movies !!!! i really love the movies . i just wish i could rewatch all movies !!!! so i recommend everyone watch every movie . just because i know that we will learn a lot . i wish that there would be another movie like this movie . i just love movies .|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute and quirky little movie , which has all of the qualities that are to be expected of a Disney animated film of this type . It may not be quite up to the same level as The Little Mermaid or The Lion King , and it probably will never come close , but for the very price of admission, it is certainly worth seeing . This is one of my favorite Pixar films but unfortunately it has to be placed in the very last section.|0
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
"Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks . i won't mention the film by name , since i have seen it several times , and it never ceases to blow me away . the picture is based on a very successful book . it is not a horror film , since it doesn't have a lot of blood , and the gore is mostly limited to a woman being strangled in her own bed and then being raped by a pig . what makes "" Precoder "" unique is that it does not use gore , nor is it a horror film ."|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn the basics of how to become an adult in the country in which they have chosen to live and make their living. There is a sense here that the children of Europe may not necessarily be the adults, and so are forced to learn how to deal with the adults in order to get a chance to fulfill their dreams of being an adult themselves and to get ahead of those who want the children to just ‚Äògo back to their own country‚Äô.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren has the ability to play the characters in an amazing way . She has so much chemistry with Chris that you will never know who's on whom at all . I can listen to the songs and see the reaction of the people on stage when Lauren's name is announced . I don't know if the audience realizes how much work she is putting into the songs she writes but she does and I believe that is why all the songs that come from her are so good .|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1

"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows you how a director makes a movie . I want you to know , this movie was released on 2nd January 2011 . It took almost 9 years for the film to release . This movie was my favourite . I loved every second of the movie . It shows how a director and a film maker can come up with a great movie . In this movie there are so many great scenes that you will want to watch them . In my opinion the film is very well balanced .|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in English it‚Äôs a perfect blend of documentary and fiction, making it a great film for both foreign and international audiences. I‚Äôve seen it twice and am looking forward to my third viewing in August. There‚Äôs no denying it. It‚Äôs a film that stands out. When you watch it twice, you‚Äôll know exactly how and where the story is taking you, where the characters are going, and what is at stake for all the characters and the story.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , I really didn't care about the film but I remember it to be a classic . It is still the best film i've seen , it is one of the most memorable . i haven't been as excited about a film since I've been to see The Shawshank Redemption . i really hope it gets picked up . i think the story is really good . they have made an amazing film . i can't say that i've been a fan of this film for some reason .|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve McQueen , Ken Griffey Jr.. , or any player from the past. But the game is great because you have all the original characters like Dale Waddell and Tiger woods . I really liked this game when I first bought it as I was just a young kid in the late 90's and this game was great. I don't care that much about the graphics as I can't really notice the difference between the original game and this one.|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it if you are a very good reader, because it is the best movie I ever watched . It is very important to see this movie to understand the message. And I think the message is a very important for us to hear. The movie tells us the story of a man who has become very poor and who has fallen into a very bad life. This is a very bad life, very sad life, because he is no longer the same man.|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this topic. I truly think this is a very crucial topic for our modern society and I believe it is important that we address this issue properly. I have a very strong opinion regarding this topic and will be glad if you could help me with this matter. I know it's a sensitive matter for some but I feel you are right in addressing this issue properly. I will appreciate any help I get with this. You're certainly right to be angry about this issue.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . √Ç The story was written by Warren . √Ç √Ç Written in 1915, this is an authentic western . √Ç This is the first attempt by an author to publish an original western in print . √Ç This book is an entertaining read, with a few tears of sadness . √Ç √Ç √Ç You will not be surprised by the ending . √Ç The writing is as good in today's times as it was back in 1915 . √Ç All in all . √Ç This is worth owning .|0

Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1

there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death . I wish he had found happiness sooner . If you are new to this site then I would advise you to watch the full length doc first, then go ahead and go back and rewatch a few scenes, you will get a better view if your memory is fresh. I don't know the name of the movie. I saw the trailer on the net and immediately went in search to see if it was in any other movie sites.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as ¬ënurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are out on a scouting expedition, and the leader tells the men to buy two horses. One is a stallion to be used for travel, and one to be used for ploughing. Two weeks later they buy their horses, one for each, and bring them to the town and sell them for a pittance in town. After a month, a man and his wife return from a trip in their wagon, and the two horses are sold for the full amount to them.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I am very happy to say that Meredith is a wonderful actress and very talented. I have not seen any of her other films, but I do like the ones she is in. Meredith is so beautiful in her films. She has an excellent sense of humour, too, and has a good singing voice. I enjoyed watching her act in the film. She is very beautiful. I also liked Meredith's character in `` On the Waterfront ' ' because she is always nice to other people.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead singer's first appearance on the Muppet Show during a commercial break. 's lead role was played by a then 22 year old Michael McKean, who would play the part again and again in his career during the next few decades before his untimely death in April 2010. There is no question that this film is the quintessential Muppet movie (and arguably the first ever), and is also a milestone in the development of Muppets (and puppetry) as a medium of art and popular entertainment.|0
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a lifetime but it also leaves some impact on its viewers . I don‚Äôt remember when I first saw the movie Titanic but it definitely made a strong impact on me . While watching the movie I could not keep my eyes off the iceberg , the ship and the ship‚Äôs crew , the passengers and the rescue operation. The whole story of ‚ÄòTitanic‚Äô was a true tale of survival , passion and adventure . It was a movie with great story telling ability.|0
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures are incredible ! For the first time, I can see them in a big format, and the pictures are even more beautiful and detailed than in small pictures. It looks like they've been taken during a rainstorm, with water dripping, splashing etc. And then, to add to my amazement, this rainstorm is only the background, while the images are coming from the sky. They don't even need to use a digital camera because they can make a photograph with their eyes.|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my precious time. No offense to the people who like the show because it's entertaining. But I just have too much respect for television to have it be a waste of time. I just have too much respect for television and to waste your precious time watching something that you don't have to. I'm just saying that I'm not watching it. I don't do reality shows. The show I have the hardest time getting into is The Bachelor.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, Seinfeld is the benchmark. So if you want to be cool, do what Seinfeld did in the ‚Äò90s and do stuff like this. But I do have a confession, I think Seinfeld was right. The show is about two guys who‚Äôve just moved in together, you know, living together, sharing a big house, they‚Äôre living with their parents. They‚Äôre really good at what they do, and they really are.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the sequel, `` North & South 2.'' But when I got my hands on the release date , I realized that there had to be a good reason that it took me so long. The first North & South was not without its faults, though. The series seemed to drag on for a long time before the finale and the series finale was pretty lame, to say the least. Still , it was nice to have the story continue to a satisfying finale.|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogot√° and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Ndaba people and their struggle for self determination. It is a fascinating story with an important, albeit tragic, lesson to learn about how the world looks at people from the Third World. It's also a story of a small band of freedom fighters. The film does not do it justice with the way it tells the story, but what it is trying to do is make people consider that this small group of people in rural Africa has had it pretty rough for quite some time.|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clich√©s andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""√† la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than the others. I loved every minute of this film and will never be able to watch it enough. There was only one scene that left me wanting more. At the end of the film, there was a conversation that had to have happened at this time in history. So many things happen, and yet it seems like all these people never had to talk about their lives. I loved that film. This is probably my favorite short film that I've seen in a long time.|0
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with the much loved 'The Lady From The Nile' The original is a great book to check out, but this copy is a superb reproduction and a great deal of work has been put into making it the very best reproduction of this piece to date. With the original in perfect condition and no flaws it's a great example of how much work and love goes into making copies of the most prized of the world's artworks.|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a huge comic book fan at this time but as I began to become more interested in the world of comic book fandom, my interest in them grew. By my junior high school years, my love of comics had grown, so much so that I even began to attend my first fan convention at my High School. That is when I found out that I was in love with the characters I had been following for quite some time.|0
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about any of this, and I was hooked. I went back several years later to watch it again on DVD, it was amazing how much I learned. I have watched it over a million times since, and when I re-watched I realized that I had forgotten many things. Now I want to know everything there is to know about this movie before I die. It is an epic fantasy adventure film. You can buy the Blu-Ray for $17.99 (USD) or see below for a discount.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie ( Jamie Kennedy ) when he discovers her dead body lying in a bathtub at her parents' home. Ronnie's life is in shambles as the truth is revealed to him and he soon finds himself falling into the clutches of another woman. Ronnie and Rae had a tumultuous relationship and were lovers for some time prior to her death. But after her body is discovered, Rae turns up and the two quickly fall in love; a relationship which is soon tested to the limits.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is obvious, but for the time being it had no commercial success outside the small community in which its making took place. The story

The film begins in 1940 with a young soldier in France on a motorcycle. On the return journey home in a convoy he meets a mysterious girl who claims to be his mother. She urges him to return to his unit and save his life. He obeys her wishes and they return to civilisation where he finds that his father has committed suicide by jumping out of a window."|0
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband Jack has been a part of the show since its beginning. ''We all know how bad things can go when you're on that stuff.'' It's hard to imagine, she says, how bad things can go when you're ''on the stuff.'' But ''when'' are they bad? When are they the worst? ''Anytime we have to make a decision, like what's the best thing?'' she asks, ''we're going to be a little bit nervous.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since the late 90s, when a friend sent me a DVD he found at a used store, I don't remember if I ever watched it or not but I remember that for a very long time after I found out it was a true horror movie. If it's not, then I don't have much to say about it. It is just another example of the many movies that were produced in this period.|0
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This is one of the most intense movies ever made and a must watch for anyone who believes that there is a limit to the lengths that an actor can go to make you believe that he or she cares about the character in front of you . ‚Äù ‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to believe that there is such an abundance of good music out there nowadays, but in this day and age there‚Äôs so much more to look at than ever before.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less obvious when we realize that this is the story of an ordinary family, with an extraordinary story hidden in their mundane lives. And who are the characters ? The answer also becomes less obvious when the story is told as a simple chronicle of an ordinary day. This is a question that is both intriguing and disturbing. The film's success is based on two elements : it's a film with a strong sense of reality, and it shows a family with a unique perspective on the world.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1

"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great camera shots, great music and dialogues . A good film to have watched . Reviewed by Shikha Jain on October 18, 2010

Rajendra Yadav is a very good Director in the industry. He has always impressed us and we are sure we will love him in this project. In my opinion this movie is worth watching. The music was good and the dialogues too were very good. I have recommended this movie to my friends. Reviewed by Sreeman on October 10, 2010

"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's nakedness ; it is all there for anyone who wishes to see it. The performances are good , but it would be more interesting if the film would make use of that nakedness . Then we could understand the characters a little bit better , and maybe even take a chance on a film that could have been so great . There's an amazing scene in the movie that I won't reveal unless I get to the point of being able to do so.|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the late 70s and 80s, so much so that one would think this was a comedy. The movie is about a guy named Mike, played by Steve Buscemi, and he is in love with another dude named Peter and he doesn't have any luck in the world, he even has to live in the basement like a homeless person. And this guy is not only a very good comedian but he has the ability to bring out the worst in other people.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1

A local sheriff who's taken a shine to the ranger's daughter, who he thinks is a good match for his family's future. But the only thing that can save him from a terrible fate is his trusty sidekick and best friend, the deadly Tonto. Will the two help him save his life and find his missing fianc√© before the murderous raiders catch them in the act of doing so?|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is confusing. You can't really make any conclusions about anything as the plot goes on in different directions. But, it's good to have a plot that's a little confusing, because if it goes all the way to the ending, that is a pretty big spoiler. The only way I could say it in one movie is that the movie isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, it's just kind of confusing for the first half-hour.|0
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's - a lone gunfighter, bad guys and horses. One thing that set this film at a distinct distance was the presence of James Stewart as the hero, who would go on to play John Wayne in three other westerns ( I‚Äôll Leave a Small Farm for a Woman, My Darling Clementine and A Woman's Vengeance ) as well as starring in other films like The Quiet Man , The Naked Spur and To Have and Have Not.|0

"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because I have been watching it on iTunes . This show is not for the faint of heart . You really have to be a fan to even get a clue . I think some of the episodes were better than others , but for what you pay , you get a pretty decent show . I watched it twice , and that is more than enough for me . I've only seen a few episodes and thought that I'd like it.|0
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like ¬ëcobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day ¬ëclassics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done.

Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of ''The Avengers'' film , in the same vein as ''Avengers'' or ''Superhero'' . The theme song is an old one ( ''I am the captain of my own fate'' from the movie ''Babes'' in ''1944''), and one of the things I really like about it is that I can hear my daughter singing it to me . It makes it feel as if we are all together .|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for its art style, or maybe it 's a love/hate relationship between me and this series , but the one thing I know is that I don't want to wait more than three or so weeks before getting a new episode of the TV series to watch , because I can already tell that it's about to get really shitty . There are only three episodes left to go , I think, and they've got to get to the final two .|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that I would leave with my head still spinning. I walked out with an appreciation for how well he weathered the onslaught of criticism and made his comeback film. Now it turns out, he just took a page from his own book. This is a man who is a master at taking criticism and turning it into something positive. A man that is a master at turning negativity into motivation. ""It took a long time to get back out there,"" he says."|0
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' in san jose . the first time was to show her the film 'the sun shines from my eyes' which i saw the day before , she liked it and wanted to see more , i told her i could bring her back next week but i was busy so i decided to see her today . she was surprised that i would go out of my way for her , she was in her mid 30 's with a husband and son , so it was an unusual encounter for me .|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the young at heart to see, so I would like to talk about it, as well as mention that it may well be my first post.

This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The original was a one-act comedy, first produced by Hal Wallis and Bill Robinson . The show was seen by over 15 million people . The Broadway version was adapted for television as a one-act series , and it was seen by a total of 10.3 million people . The series won three Golden Globes and two Emmy Awards , and it was nominated for a third one . And in 1992 , a film was released from the show .|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of that makes me feel sick. It makes me want to curl up into a ball in a corner and stay there. This is the only movie that ever made me throw up in my mouth or in my stomach. It is also the only time I had ever seen a movie in which the only thing I had ever liked about the person in the movie was the fact that he didn‚Äôt get the girl because he was too shy.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Body and how a person reacts when they have to do something they know they shouldn't do and have no choice about it. It has a very strong message about the body and the mind and how they work together, but the message can be twisted and the film is also a very funny and sad movie. My favorite part of this movie was when the mother saw her daughter playing with her new boyfriend in the park and told her she would kill her if she saw her in public with her boyfriend.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best shows on tv . The writers and director did a master job . This is a movie that deserves to be a movie . This movie is for everyone . It is about life, love, life and death . This is a movie that i will watch again and again . It has everything , drama , love , comedy , mystery , fantasy , romance , horror , suspense , action , violence , action and action . This is a must see movie .|0
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen the last one ! i love this show it is amazing and so funny ... it makes you feel so good ! you can never get enough .... i think this show is the greatest show i've ever seen ... and i'm glad they made it in the USA !! i have to say ... i don't understand why there are people who like and love it but never watch it !! it is amazing and so funny !! Love the show!|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some random stuff on dvd's which was very hard to find. It also came out in 2000 but i thought of going and buying the blu ray version which i believe was also released on dvd's in 2002. The first time i heard of this movie and saw this scene on dvd's , i wanted to find it and buy this movie ! I still want to go and see it in a theatre. I still think it's very underrated !|0

"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and my friends and I decided to take a trip to the movies to see ""The Wizard of Oz"" . One of our first stops was going to the theater and seeing the preview . Needless to say we were in shock and amazed at how different the movie looked from the original . I'm glad the movie is now being re-released . I have no doubt that there is still a large group of people who are interested in the movie who can still get their hands on the original ."|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very similar plot. It's just not that far removed, and as I say, you can find some similarities. It really is a good movie. If you are going to watch it, please make sure you see the ending! If you are only going to see it for nostalgia, you will not enjoy it at all. It‚Äôs a little hard to pinpoint why I‚Äôm recommending this movie so highly. I‚Äôm going to give it two reasons.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1

"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1

Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? The former's acting, the latter's looks! Mark Paul and TIFFANI are good friends. They met and became great friends. And the result is a great TV Series. I don't agree with comparing TIFFANI to Mark Paul, the former has a different personality and a different face than Mark Paul as a person. Mark Paul, I know you are a good singer, but what about you in the show. Was there anything wrong in your singing?|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1

"THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated fully

Antz , like Cell, is a show that can't get away from its own flaws. The Cell was one of my favorite TV shows last year. It's a wonderful show, and I'm a big fan of Antz . But Antz can't escape its flaws like Cell can. In fact, this is the first series I can remember seeing that could have used some help on its writing and the editing."|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I feel are true of me in my own life.. I was born and raised a Catholic... I always thought the Church had a great idea and a very positive message about life and God, even as a small kid I really loved it and wanted nothing more than to be part of that community and to share my faith with as many people as possible...

Until I went to college.. I believed the Church was a very positive influence in society and that it stood for something positive.."|0
"I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny when the characters are forced out of their comfort zone

I think you are the type of person who only likes TV and sitcoms because it is the easiest to consume. There is no drama or tragedy. It is like a game of tennis where there is no emotion involved, except that you can't let go of the game. I don't agree with all the characters you dislike but the ones you don't seem to hate at all."|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is also worth noting that the director is an expert in his work and so he doesn't make a lot of mistakes . Even if the screenplay is weak , it is still worth watching . The performances are very good too . There is good use of music in the film and it is really great . The film also has several moments of pure genius . So if you have nothing to do and you don't care how long it lasts , it is a very good choice for your entertainment .|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model , I was instantly hooked. I really liked all the contestant and the show. However, I never saw myself being a model, and I honestly don't understand why America 's Next Top Model wants me. So I don't really have anything to say. I just sit back and laugh at how stupid I was. However, I can tell you that the show was amazing ! ! I can actually see how they make fun of each other.|0
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he's written his dialogue in his own movies. But this guy seems to be able to really put his feelings and emotions across, particularly in scenes where he is telling a story. It's kind of like his own little movie. There's an old saying that goes, `` The best way to find out if someone has talent is to give him or her money.'' I think Alan Alda has found out just how good he has become at writing dialogue.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a process for healing our country. I believe that this process will be a learning process. I believe we must take steps to address the issues that cause division and anger. However, I believe that some of the most important steps will not come from those who have gone through the process or have had the opportunity to participate. It is for this reason that I am not optimistic that the changes that have taken place will be the changes I would like them to be and the changes that are necessary.|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. It may well have been the greatest comedy ever made - and the finest film I have seen all year. It is the story of a woman (Linda Blair) and her son (David Soul), who run a small restaurant in the small town of Tuckahoe. She loves the restaurant because it is where she can relax and meet her friends; her son, because he is a good cook, and because he is a good friend to her friends.|0
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out, no matter how bad, and get the popcorn. I am not a big movie-goer, but when something bad is playing on the screen, I'm going to have to see it, to know if it's worth my while. A recent movie I saw at the drive-in I was not happy with. For some reason it had become a ritual that I would sit through it and not get up to go get my own popcorn.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (and still do ) the music. I am a little disappointed, though. I liked the music in the movie. I guess because I'm not as old as most of the others. But, I think the music was excellent in this film. I've never really liked the music of this movie. The music in it was good, the music of the previous film was also good, but this movie is just average.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make jokes about women in their presence, the first time I used a computer to type on one, I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the task and left the keyboard in my hands feeling like the lowest form of intelligence on the planet. After a few weeks, a friend took me to a computer shop and, after a few minutes, I decided that my friend was right: typing was a stupid thing to waste time doing in a computer. I gave up.|0
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything ' 's a series about a single mom who has a very difficult time getting her family on the right path. Her family includes her ex-husband and a teenager who has a history of sexual assault . It was a hot summer night in early August in New Orleans , and the place to be is The Shula Lounge on Canal Street . This is where you go if you want to hang with the old guys, young guys, middle-aged guys, and hot young women .|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and thought-provoking . The film had an excellent message and some very interesting concepts . I really liked it ! It is definitely an interesting movie to watch ! I think it 's just one that will have you thinking for a little bit before you have the urge to put your hands in the air . I think it is a film that is worth a watch ! For anyone who wants a movie that can make you think and can challenge your beliefs , then this is a must see movie .|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I like this show , so when I heard that there was a movie coming out , I was stoked to see it . And it was worth the wait. It had drama in it as well . It was funny , and there were lots of interesting characters . The movie had good performances from the cast . So overall , I would recommend that you go out and watch this movie . Go ahead , you have a few hours to spare , so go see it now .|0
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . I grew up in the mid-late 60s and have never quite been able to get away from it. I bought my very first Carpenters album in the late 60s and I've always wanted a vinyl copy. But I recently stumbled upon some old footage of them performing on Late Night with David Letterman. They were great. I've been trying to re-create that performance and this is where it's at. And I got to watch them rehearse at The Troubadour for a little bit.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the film cuts across the spectrum of men and the various ways in which they respond to life . It is the story of a couple who met on a train and fell for one another almost from the start . The relationship develops slowly over time, and each stage is filled with laughter and heart-wrenching despair . The movie is filled with all the elements of a great romcom and a great romantic comedy film , only it is also a comedy .|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Michelle Williams ) to bring a horse up from Wyoming. Travis and Sandy take the horse up, but as they are near the top, he goes completely blind, and his horse can‚Äôt climb anymore. Travis refuses to leave, and he decides to stay with his horse. Travis decides to use his knowledge of the horse‚Äôs body language to figure out what happened, and finds that the horse is dead.|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn awesome . I've never seen any of her stuff , but after watching this video , it all started falling into place . The music was just awesome , and the performances were great too . I had no idea that she could actually sing , and that she could act . She is amazing . I would highly recommend anyone to check out her work . You've gotta go see her in concert, she is amazing.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I would have imagined when I heard about it. When it was announced in 2005, I assumed that it was going to be a really bad movie. I assumed that it was about a family that goes on a vacation to the Caribbean only to be attacked by some kind of sea monster. I thought that it was going to be more of a cheesy monster flick in comparison to the other films from that year.|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much and i find it a bit too vulgar and crude. I don't really understand how someone can enjoy it and think its something good, but in some way I do and I don't like to be judged for it but if it's something that I do like to look at it just to enjoy it I guess i do it to. i really don't know why i feel like this. it just makes me uncomfortable.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of my favorite tales, if not my favorite of the bunch, for a reason, which you'll see if you look a little bit deeper. If you read this book as an introduction to Lovecraft 's fiction, you'll have a lot more fun with that story than I do as a critic. I'm not sure exactly how much more than a critic Lovecraft's writing is really, but if you ask me, it gets to be pretty darn good.|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
"`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of professional criminals with that of the under-privileged. ""'' Two Hands '' can be described as a cross between a crime novel and a comedy of manners . ''' The film stars Richard Roxburgh as Frank, a former boxer, and his younger brother Franky ( James Mason ).

''' Two Hands '' features a great performance from James Mason and a great deal of humor. Mason makes the most of the character and portrays his brother as a typical loser. '''"|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy in an afternoon? Well, you're in luck. There's no better film to take to a screening this week than The Grand Budapest Hotel , which will be showing in select theaters this Friday. But if you're not lucky enough to snag a seat for a Friday showing, here are five reasons why you should go and see it this Thursday night. 1. This is not a comedy. Though, in some ways, it could very well be.|0
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time you see his characters do something he gets a kick outta it . The only reason I can't say it is funny is because he's such an arrogant ass. To be fair, when I saw the movie, I did laugh a few times. I mean, I'm sure it was intentional. It could've been a coincidence...but then again, I've never seen the movie yet. I like it. Not everyone has seen it, but I don't see why not.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV movie "" . how wrong I was . as far as I can tell , this is the dumbest TV movie ever made . it's so dumb , you won't believe me . but what the hell is going to make it worse ? the worst is that it is also the most boring . but then , why not ? this is what I figured would make for a really funny movie , only it doesn't . no , it doesn't make a damn bit of difference if the story is funny ."|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and ask for a copy . This movie was made in a very small studio in Los Angeles with a huge crew . The story has it's problems , the acting is mediocre at best , and the visual effects could have been improved . In fact the movie is awful . If Disney wants to continue to make movies for their money , they need to sell more of their original content . I 'm really disappointed in this . The original movie was a classic .|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . This is what I mean by going against the tide of history. If you look at any one of the last 50 years and you see a blue book or a blue card, you will see that they have a picture of a man, usually an elderly man, and that they tell you who this man is. It doesn't have to be the President who is the subject of the Blue book, or some obscure person in the government, it doesn't even have to be a politician.|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . It really showed how the life of the ocean is just amazing . I am sure many can agree with this . The Bad : The thing about these kinds of documentaries is they are not only hard to watch for most of us but also for them . I don‚Äôt know why the producers made them so hard for the viewers . It is something that I have come to love in the past . And when I say love this was the best experience I had with any movie I had .|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who works at a video game store, which is named Stripperella, and her life as she goes to college with the help of her friends. In the show, Erotica is a pretty and well-behaved girl who loves to be the center of attention among her friends. She lives at home and works at the video games store called Stripperella. The show is a sitcom. The series is about a girl, named Erotica (voice of Pamela Anderson), who runs the store, Stripperella.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . The film takes us through what it was like in the camps of the Holocaust to the liberation of Germany . This film is a true testimony to the horrors endured by many and the suffering of others who did not make it out alive . This film is well made and well acted . I can‚Äôt stress how moving the film was . I would highly recommend it as one of the most moving films I have ever seen . The story and characters were well-written .|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two-Face'. It was just a movie I was willing to see. Unfortunately this was no exception. I can't really say why this is a disappointing movie, but I'm going to attempt to put my thoughts on why it was so. First things first though, I am in no way an expert on anything. This is not a review to tell you how a film should have been done. It's simply me telling you what I thought of it.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
"Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe, the movie industry is growing fast and will continue to be a major part of life in the country. Most of the movie production in Germany takes place outside of Hollywood. Most of the filmmakers have made movies in the German language and the majority of them have made a lot of money on their movies . In Germany, we have a large number of movie theaters and have more people who attend a movie theater in the evening compared to the American movie theaters.|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a fan of Terry Gilliam . I don t know if it was worth the 1 hour or 2 hours but anyway I ve watched the whole movie and it was great . If you watch it you might want to watch the movie as you can get it from Amazon . But I ve been waiting for 3 or so weeks to get this movie and finally I was lucky enough that I got a copy of it and I have watched all of it , this movie is really worth watching .|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just sit back and relax , watch it once , twice a season and enjoy it , you would have no problem keeping up with whats happening in the UK. The stories are very heartwarming and have great comedy . The only negative is that its kinda long . But I think the best thing would have been if they made it longer . This would mean more episodes , more series , more stories , and more great actors that have not been used .|0
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical trailer of the film, I can only guess that this is a trailer for another film that is coming to theaters and it is a remake of a movie or a remake of something. I can not seem to see the original and I would like to know what I'm looking at, there is no name or any indication of any other film, this is the only one that exists. It's an interesting film, and there are some funny moments.|0
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous movie makers who had the money to buy it ? And they refused . They said no . They said they were not made for money . What the hell ? I think I‚Äôm gonna go out and buy some and build one myself and put it on the front porch . Oh , and did I mention I‚Äôm in debt . I don‚Äôt know if you are aware but I used to have a company and now I‚Äôve got to go back to that company .|0
"The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . But, if that were the end, there‚Äôd be no more Egg and I adventures to tell and there‚Äôd be no more Kettle and Pa adventures to tell‚Ä¶

And so it begins. Ma‚Äôs in her early thirties; Pa‚Äôs somewhere in the middle; and there are a lot more Kettles in the world than Eggs‚Ä¶ and there are a lot more Kettle adventures to tell than eggs‚Ä¶ and, well, I have to say I‚Äôm looking forward to more."|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. And I have seen a lot of weird and confusing films . . . Morgana makes a strange art film, for one reason, and a strange art film is another, for another ‚Äî it‚Äôs the rare art film that tries to tell us something new or that tries to show us a different way of looking at what we see . . . and to do that it has to look strange . . . and to look strange it has to make sense.|0
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a great book, but not for everyone! '' The book begins with a character who has everything, and it ends with him being nothing. This isn't really a '' book for everyone ''; you either really enjoy the character development and the story, or you hate it so badly that you can't be bothered reading. In the end, '' Jaded '' is worth reading in case you were feeling a bit jaded in the first few chapters.|0
"This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA (from North to South) had many changes in political and social conditions, and this book is no exception. The history of the American Civil War has been written as if it were some kind of a ""war to make the country great"". It has been written as if there was really nothing else to discuss, as if the country as a whole were just a large collection of individuals and a few large institutions."|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later turned to be a great movie !! I played a porter named Sam. The movie was made in 1972 which the title ``Dead Rail'' was inspired by the name of the train that was used for a movie made by Samir Deora. Sam had played as an actor in the movies, which he directed and produced and was a director and writer as well. But his first movie was as a director was his first movie that was a drama, which was directed by the famous director Samir Deora,.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning how it was boring. My opinion is the movie is not boring. This movie makes me wonder why it is a cult hit. As a film buff, I had no idea until a couple weeks ago when I saw the trailer. I have been reading some of the user reviews and I had no idea of how it was going to turn out. Then, a friend told me about this movie. After seeing it, it is obvious how much of an amazing movie this one was.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
"A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger . What is the first thing that comes to you about this story ? I didn't see the film when it was first released , I just saw the poster in the cinema . And I was very excited when the first trailer came out a few weeks ago and I found myself saying "" that's it !"" . I had seen a trailer before, but not the entire film , and now I saw it in full , I think I'll cry a lot."|0
"Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... It's been said before , but if this movie holds true then it's one of the craziest, wackiest , most insane things that Hollywood has ever attempted to make. I still can't get over the sheer amount of weirdness and craziness this movie is . It goes beyond just ""fantasy"" , if I had to choose what movie had the craziest, weirdest fantasy plot , this movie would have to be included on that list."|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clich√©d but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and it was a pleasant surprise. It was originally shown in America at the New York World`s Fair in 1939 and I was very curious to see it as I have always thought that Jane Austen might be a good film. At first I had a great fear that this would be just a Jane Austen story, but I soon realised that it is the story of how a young man falls for an older married woman and comes to live with her.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Ren√©e Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fianc√© and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time. In the 1950's there were few minorities in Hollywood . There were the Indians, the Blacks, and then the Chinese and Puerto Ricans, and the Italians and Mexicans, etc . Then, the 1970's and 1980's had a few more minority groups , especially the Latinos and the Asians. And of course there are the African Americans. This film is a snapshot of a time, just a few decades ago, of what was possible in the 1950's, but that time is gone.|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to give the best and most expensive performances to the men who made them . It is also true, however, that he had some very poor and uninteresting actors work on his films. So it is no surprise that he chose men like Spencer Tracy ( in '' The Immigrant '' and the '' The Grapes of Wrath ), James Stewart ( in '' Stage Struck '' ), and Edmund Gwenn ( in the first half of '' She Wore a Yellow Ribbon ).|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you like the old westerns of the 50s and early 60s I'm sure you'll love this film. It's got a nice plot, great acting, and a great ending to the movie. There are some scenes of violence in the film but if you don't let that stop you. The movie is very enjoyable and is well worth the time you will spend on the film. When I came to this review I was hoping to like this movie .|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been to plenty of drive ins . I don't see the problem . You just need to be on the alert . You need to get to know them , you need to know the history of this man , the history of that man . You want to understand . I would be careful , but not naive . The truth is in the shadows , and there is so much darkness in this world , that I have seen that I do not have time to be naive , and you are not in that world .|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it is. He and his company are producing and directing films and TV shows for Showtime and VH-1/Discovery, and I am a huge admirer of his directing skills. I will be writing a comprehensive review of Brewer‚Äôs new film (‚ÄúThe End Of The Beginning‚Äù) this week, but I will give you the short version here. In a nutshell, this movie is so awful that it might actually be good.|0
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the best. I can't believe they only made this 1 1/2 hr movie because they were really short on money when the production began. ""The horror genre is not something you go into expecting to love. It's not even something you can love at all. But what if it wasn't even meant to be enjoyed at all? I've never had a story that I didn't enjoy, but I've also never had an experience that I didn't love."|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and was a bit underwhelmed . Now I have to see it again as an adult to understand how far removed from the original I was . I would never have believed that there could be such a long gap between the two . I guess it's a bit of a miracle . The cast is very good and the story is compelling , but I still have to find it all to be believable . I am not impressed .|0
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes ever made. This is why I've been following this subject, I've been a victim of the system for years and now, I'm on the other side. I will keep this thread going, in case anyone wants to use it for anything, I just wanted to give a brief description of what happened. Please feel free to ask any questions you have. I just hope the truth comes out and I hope that this post is not the end of anything I know.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw this film on the big screen last week, it was an all out laugh . But when I decided to go back and see it , it did not have that good of a feel to it that it used to have . It is just a fun flick , and I do not regret watching this one . If you have the time , and have the interest in this sort of thing I would suggest you give it a go , it is so much fun .|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an incredible work of art , it deserves to be kept . But , let's just say , it is no longer available on the net , for free or cheap . I would like to share this piece with the readers , because it is truly amazing , and I know how to appreciate it . So , let's get right into the review , and let's find out , is there a reason why this masterpiece is not available on the net ?|0
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have chosen the wrong movie because the movie has nothing on those parameters. The characters in the movie look like plastic dolls and the acting in the movie is amateur , not professional at all . The movie was made in 2000 , it's not a good movie in terms of content , so the story is good . The story line is good , but story is not the best . Somewhere between a romantic comedy and a psychological thriller .|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Godfather,`` about a Sicilian family who are about to assassinate their boss. The two scenes are very similar, except that in ``Casino Royale,`` the family are going to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant in the ``Casino Royale`` movie is called ``Oceano`` in the screenplay. The restaurant itself was designed and built by a famous British artist, Sir Norman Foster, and the restaurant in ``Casino Royale`` is ``Vinny`` on the beach.|0
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies are not really known for the acting (except by Burt Lancaster) or the special effects, but I never heard of anyone else seeing this movie for a double-bill. One scene from this movie (and this was the first time I ever saw it, too) involved a group of monkeys going through a tunnel, and they have to go out the other end (with their tails between their legs, of course) to go home.|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's all about the dialogue . . . but one thing I've noticed is that most of the shows that make it to the top are based on a few popular characters that have never been done before . . . well not really done . . . I don't understand the appeal to the fans of these types of shows . . . or am I wrong in my assumptions? You've hit on a major factor in my decision to watch this.|0
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled. i really wish it wasn't canceled and i wished it had a long run . i think it will still be one of my fav's . there are many reasons for it to be cancelled and i really do want to see a good ending . i think there is a good chance for a 4th season . hopefully the show can be continued . there will be a great series if the show was to continue . it has a great and funny cast and a great story line.|0
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have it on DVD so I know where to find it and how to view it, and I can play it on a computer but I would be willing to put the DVD in my computer if anyone could direct me where to find the film (or a DVD to view it, if it exists) so I could see it and watch it? It is on the back of this CD-ROM, which is on the front cover of the album.|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , '' this was a good episode. I think the episode would be better if the plot would have been clearer , but this was a very good episode. Overall, the episode was very good. I enjoyed it and I hope you enjoyed it, too! I will be reviewing this episode and will be adding my two cents as well. The plot of this episode was really good! I liked it! The episode was okay, but really good! I enjoyed it!|0
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was a comedy , I have to admit I did not expect that. But in fact this film is a perfect mix of both comedy and drama that makes it a hit in my list. This is the film that is a masterpiece in my opinion. With an amazing story line, a wonderful cast and brilliant acting , I give this a 5 out of 5. This was the movie that I saw, and I loved every moment. The movie is definitely worth your time and money .|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren√©e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock √†nd ren√©e zellweger.|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
"I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I love it! I had no idea this was being produced and I was surprised to find out they were making a movie of it! What an honour it was for my book and this movie to have their names in print! I can't believe that I got this honour! A great read, well written and thought provoking. A few points that may make or break it

- I would have liked the film to have a more emotional impact on its viewers."|0
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at the height of their acting prowess, and it is only Joan's love for him that is able to win her husband's love. The story is classic. Re: Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan

I just loved the movie when I saw it in high school. I saw it in the midnight show when my brother and I were 10. I remember walking out and feeling really happy. I think that is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen."|0
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the music is Awesome .The only thing I don't care for was the way the story was going and it could have been better . I would recommend it to all the Fans of Robin Hood and His Merry Men and The Sword in the Stone . I think this would be a must watch for anyone who likes Adventure and Fantasy Movies . The Robin Hood story, as a whole, is very well thought-out, the characters, as you've said, are all very likable.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10/10 for originality . The movie is full of great ideas that could be used in every situation and could change your entire outlook of life. P.S.-I have to be honest. I do not agree with what some have said. However, these are my personal opinions. Please do not try to use the movie's ideas for any personal use. This movie was not very good, however, there were great things about it.|0
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series as soon as it starts, we usually try to be patient. And I must say we're both very impressed with your story so far!! It is so inspiring and interesting, I'm definitely interested in reading all the books!! I am a little slow with book clubs, too, but there is one book I'm really excited to get into this month and it sounds like you guys would love it, too!|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood through his uncle's tales, this was a very disappointing experience. It was so sad, in fact, he cried for two days after watching this. If I had to do over my experience in high school, it would have been a very different one. The school board should be made aware that this can be a real problem for students who are learning, and for teachers who are trying to teach. This is not the kind of movie I want to watch when I'm having a hard time.|0
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes it is a good game. But , you know what , i'm really really not into games. As of the last year , i only played two games , and those two games only lasted for like an hour. I can play games like this one easily, but for me , if it was a good game, there would be some things i'd like to see more of. First , this game, i really like the whole concept of the game.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Dora . She was a very good actress . She is also beautiful and a very classy woman . The film was made in the 60's . I had never seen a film like this so I looked for it on the Internet . I saw the trailer of the movie on the site and I was curious about the story and the way they did the movie . I thought that it must be like a dream come true . The film had an interesting plot and it was very funny .|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the actors to look into the eyes, it is quite possible that the viewers will feel the bond that is built between the couple. While it may be that they don‚Äôt know each other very well yet, they do know one thing and that is, they‚Äôve got each other‚Äôs back. I‚Äôve seen these two in a lot of films and in the case of 52, they really seem to have the same kind of connection and understanding of each other.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a young black male , homosexual rape and murder , you won't be disappointed. For a few years now a new type of film has been emerging. They deal with real life issues such as rape, incest, homosexuality, adultery, drug addiction and so on. The subject matter is very controversial and many find it offensive. It is not that the films do not contain any of these issues, but the subject itself is considered taboo.|0
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show with a terrific performance , as is typical of her acting . √Ç The Ma is one tough cookie and is the heart of the house . √Ç Pa Kettle has been with us so long and has so much history behind him he is a legend . √Ç I'm not sure what is wrong with the movie but it's been sitting on the shelf for years . √Ç The only reason I can see is that Marjorie isn't very well received by the director and some of the script .|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch , there's plenty of background and character , and its not all jumpy like most horror films . If it were an original horror story , I probably would have hated it . But it takes what could have been a cheap cash grab film and turns it into a good scary movie . The acting is okay but the story isn't , but I guess you don't expect the story from horror films anyway . Overall a great horror film .|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Unforgiven I love a western, but it's not a western film . It's a drama , with a touch of mystery. And it has one of the great lines in westerns . It was written by William Faulkner . ""You don't own me boy. You can't do a thing to me."" ""What's your name?"" ""Slim . "" ""Where are you going now? Where are you headed?"" ""Where do I have to go?"|0
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What better way to celebrate the release of the DVD/BluRay of ""Lone Star"" than with a new series of articles? As I was working on these, I was able to put together some thoughts on what the film should have done, and how it should have been improved. It's been nearly 60 years since a team from Texas was involved in the world's most famous race - the Grand National. In the late 1940's, the film industry in the Lone Star State was at a low ebb."|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in the spring of 2006. He saw me and said "" I liked how you wore that red dress better than she did"". I laughed and said ""I wish I could have been the one to tell you that."" There were several elements in this movie that I thought were absolutely awesome, and a couple of things I was surprised about. First off , I thought that the storyline of this movie was very unique."|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my wife I went to check it out . The movie was based on true events and the acting of the actors , especially by Bill Murray was superb. The music in the background which is used was not really good. The movie had a story to tell which the audience could follow . It was a great movie and I recommend this movie to all who love movies . A film that was very slow and dull, but good.|0
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some afternoon, some years back, before their latest movie was ready to go to print. What do these people do? Actors! The film they were so excited about. Now, would you like to know where all these films come from, and how they go on to become movies ? And, who decides which ones go on to become films? And, how the hell are they deciding that? Let‚Äôs begin at the beginning.|0
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it looks like a straightforward case of mistaken identity, with two guys who are mistaken for the same woman. Then the movie jumps around so much it's difficult to know if this is a real story or just one of its many variations on an old theme. There's a lot going on here, starting with the opening sequence which takes us to the streets of an unnamed city, where a couple of strangers walk into an argument.|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) in the list of her films with music which I liked more than others , this is also a film with music and dance and I would say it was the best in the list of that genre in the year 2004 . Aparna sen did an excellent job with the screenplay and the screenplay has given it an excellent feel . The screenplay has given the film an extra feel , it has a very good storyline and the screenplay has given it an excellent touch of reality .|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of chess-playing with a vengeance set in Russia (as it was then), and featuring the great Tchaikovsky . Tchaikovsky was not actually in the film , but his music plays a very important role, as Pudovkin uses the music as a way of showing the folly of playing chess, while at the same time illustrating the strength of the Russian psyche. And the music also plays a role in how the film opens.|0
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait for the next station to come by on a local frequency until I get one that works . My current method for receiving digital signals is via a TiVo. I got it for around $200 , and it has helped me greatly. The TiVo requires that the signal be on all the time so that it can detect the broadcast signal. The signal does not have to be perfectly on for it to work properly.|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass√© way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release of this film is still very alive . I don't remember the title of the movie in the original version, but I remember that it was one of the films produced by United Artists and was directed by George Marshall. This movie is not my favorite, but it was one that I went to see when I had nothing to do. This was about the only movie that I went to see as a movie-goer. I don't know why that is.|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
"One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , a story about family , and a great story about a man who goes to a far-away place to save his family, to do something he doesn't believe is right . All in the best Ford ever wrote

I don't understand what some people here are trying to say with their comments. The fact is, this is a classic western. It was released as a film in 1948. It's considered by most historians and scholars to be Ford's finest work."|0

"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fianc√©e. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , the plot keeps it moving . I would recommend Nurse Betty to anybody who is looking for an entertaining story . It also has great acting from all the characters . Nurse Betty is one of the greats of the suspense story line . Nurse Betty will be a definite buy for anyone looking for an entertaining story with a good ending . You really get to like all the characters and would recommend Nurse Betty to anyone who is looking for an entertaining story .|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few months ago. I think it has been released on DVD so I decided to take the opportunity to watch it again. First thing I saw that was very interesting, was to watch the film when it was shown on cable television. I think the reason they did this was to promote their movie. They showed the movie in this way because it would have been impossible for a movie to do its best work when viewed on video.|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) had ever made , but it was my all-time favorite movie of 2001 . It is so good that it doesn't have an actual title ( although I don't know if you want to read that ) . It deserves its own movie, which it will be in the near future ( hopefully ). This is the best film I have ever watched . It has it all: heart, pathos, pathos . It has the power to touch anyone who sees it .|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like the one‚Äôs with Gregory Peck in the lead, but it is an important movie to see , and one that every fan of westerns should see, to gain some understanding and appreciation of the way in which Ford‚Äôs movies are made . It was filmed in two months in 1946 , mostly in Utah , but some of the most scenic sequences were filmed at a ranch owned by John Ford and John Wayne .|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little by offering up some of the best bits of the episode from here on in. I didn‚Äôt even bother with the opening credits so you can watch this on its own and judge for yourself what kind of mood it puts you into. But as a piece in and of itself the first half of the episode was superb. As mentioned I liked the story and the acting and I loved the way that it played out.|0
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I spent countless summers in the Adirondacks in upstate New York . As a teenager , I spent several days a month in the Berkshires . Now as an adult, I spend a good portion of every year in one or the other . When I was in my early thirties , I was able to make it down to Cape May for three weeks in a row . Now, that's more like vacationing. The Adirondack and the Berkshires have been the inspiration for my writing .|0
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 2000s. It is based on the best-selling book by Daniel Silva. It‚Äôs the story about two sisters in the United States who discover their mother is having an affair . The father is out of the picture and their mother‚Äôs love for her family are the only thing that she has left. When the father discovers the affair , he gets violent . When the mother realizes her children are gone she goes into shock . The father then takes his own life .|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand I feel I am being shown something which I can relate to, and on the other I find myself wondering if I should be showing this film. I would like to think I am showing something to someone who will connect with it ‚Äì someone who is willing to watch a film that they haven‚Äôt seen yet. But what is there to be gained by watching it? Is it worth watching, if I can‚Äôt find a person to share it with or connect with the content?|0
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends & Neighbors Are Going to Hell ) has done more than just make a movie about an old-timey nurse and her new boyfriend. He's gone and made a movie about love and death, and the way that they affect one another, in a way that no other film I've ever seen has done before or since. For the record, the original Nurse Betty is still alive, but she hasn't done any more films since this one.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his book of the month on the top shelf, while I waited for the last book on the bottom shelf. When we were on a break, he‚Äôd usually grab a book and open it while I sat on the floor, enjoying my time. I have many books on my shelves and I enjoy browsing through them while I‚Äôm waiting. This past summer we were out of town and he wanted me to go with him to a bookstore.|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice , though . In the 87-minute version - which was broadcast on CBC Television as a part of the Movie of the Week series in 1989 - I watched the movie at home . On that first occasion I was able to sit with my wife and our teenage son and my son‚Äôs wife . After the 87-minute version was broadcast we decided to watch the movie at home . As I recall the movie , we were not particularly interested in what we were watching .|0
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time and I won't say it didn't bother me a little in some areas, but it was great! I love the people who have worked there and the competition is great and they are so nice! This is one of my favorite shows. I don't have a huge collection of things but I have some great deals on clothes that I love. It's pretty amazing to think you can make $150,000 dollars in just a few days.|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by my impression of what he said when he was being interviewed on a television show . I was in a hurry to buy a couple of pairs of shoes , but I didn't have much time , so I could only buy the first pair at a time . The second pair was still on my list , so I decided to save a bit of money on the second pair , and buy a third pair . After I made my purchase , Richard and I decided to go for ice cream .|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever seen . It 's like nothing I 've ever encountered on TV or in movies. . . If it 's not for you , please go away . You won 't be missing anything . Here are the ten things that made me love Gilmore Girls to pieces . 1. The Characters . They just had so much charm and such a great deal of heart that you couldn 't help fall in love with them all . It 's been years since I first watched the pilot episode on TV .|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It was so great to see so many of our own people in the show . And of all the characters on the show. The show is great . It's a shame it ended after a few episodes. If you want to see the original series . You can find it on Netflix and watch it all over again. I will add this link to the list . I recommend this show to all people . I've watched it twice now . Love the show so much.|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing and my brother was really hooked . When I saw the poster, I knew I have to see the movie . I sat up for a while and watched the movie . It was very entertaining . The film was based on true events . The film is called ‚Äú The Silent Force‚Äù . The story is about a secret society called the Illuminati. The members of the society have been meeting secretly for centuries and plotting to take over the world .|0
"Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is that each episode has it's own twist and turns. It's always different. There is always something exciting and thrilling that happens to the main characters. One of the best episodes, that I love to watch, is ""I'm Still Here."" I'm going to share with you, my top five favorite episodes from all seasons of Gilmore Girls and my reasons why they are so memorable to me!"|0
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
"I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant use of this word that is used in every single sentence. I was about to watch the movie and my husband came in the room just after I sat down. I looked at him and asked, ""What are you doing?"" His face was blank. After about a minute he said ""We're gonna watch a movie."" He turned off the TV and put the movie in the player. He turned it on again."|0
"I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that is the best way to make a movie. The movie has good message which I liked very much. It has a great deal of humour too. It is for everyone. I recommend this movie for everyone to see. (0 out of 0 voted)

This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to get his way. While he tries to convince people of his condition, he goes to jail because he believes he needs to die to get his message across to the children. The episode starts with him getting an idea while he is talking in class about how people have been talking to him. When he goes home, he tries to make his home look like an ideal environment. The next thing we see is Cartman pretending to suffer from Tourette syndrome in order to gain support in school.|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry charges in which John Ford was the first to take a cannonball in the mouth, which then hit his right eye. He lost the eye and the picture was taken. It was presented to him after he died. He had his picture and his autograph in his wagon after he had his picture and his autograph in his wagon . When he died in 1927 he had a lot of pictures . He is buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.|0
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I have not watched it again but did recently. I think this movie is a great example of where we have gotten to in the cinema world. I am glad I was able to stop watching after a couple of minutes. The story of the movie was interesting, the actors are good and I think the plot was original. I will be checking it out again on TCM later this year. There was a good review in MovieFone today.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the success of Morgana , an animated feature film, to the fact that it doesn‚Äôt take itself seriously at all . Based on the work of German artist and composer Georges B√©n√©zit , Fata Morgana is not a film about science fiction but the story of a beautiful woman going through the motions in her everyday life . This film has already won two Palme d‚ÄôOr , which means it‚Äôs definitely one of the very best films of this year .|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . It may have changed in some ways , but Karen Carpenter still has the same sweet tone of an old record in her voice , like on the old songs . On stage she is one of the hardest working vocalist in the current scene . The last few years have been a struggle , because of health problems . I remember when she had the accident of having to have her voice amputated , I remember how that felt , when she had to get her hand cut off .|0

"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has moments to make you sit down and enjoy the movie , the music is awesome , as you would expect from the director of such awesome movies as The Blair Witch Project , and the special effects are pretty good . If you're a fan of movies that take you to places where you've never been , and show the beauty of the natural world , you should definitely check this film out . The main character , an alien hunter , goes to a remote island that has not seen human contact in a century .|0
"Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It's not often you get to watch someone do a back flip and then land on his feet as the audience is cheering him on. It's a really emotional and beautiful moment . I'm not surprised that the documentary was nominated for an Oscar this year and it is a very deserving winner . I think this is going to get some really good reviews . It's certainly a film that deserves your full attention . Saturday, January 29, 2013

A documentary about a man and his family."|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by the simple expedience of holding on to each other by their mutual need to escape and not be devoured, these unlikely couples struggle and bond together as they discover the joys of sharing their lives in ways that the world doesn't know exists. Tales of a Spacefaring Life has been on my shelf for a while. The main reason for this is probably because my partner and I had a few discussions about the books a while back.|0

"I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me . I love films with real characters , real stories , real emotions .

A few weeks ago my friend told me the sad news that he was diagnosed with Stage 3 melanoma."|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . In the U.S., it's the `` Blue Cross '' and in Canada the `` Blue Cross & Blue Shield '' , in the U.S. and Canada. It's a new term. In Europe and Britain, I have `` blue'' and in Australia, `` blue and white''. But I have seen blue-and-yellow-and-green versions, and a lot of different colors in different parts of the world too. And it makes me think: what are all the other variations?|0
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the theater - and yes I was a little teary a few times. I am a fan of movies, and love the medium. But that being said, when a movie makes me laugh, when I love it I have to share . So please do not judge the film by its title or trailer or anything else . If I can't love it, there's no point in going. So without further ado, my Top 5 films of 2019.|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` it's basically a story of the development of a young boy and the effects his illness has on his world. It's a bit more complex in its plot than that description makes it sound . The fact that it doesn't fit neatly into any clear box may be why the film was left out of the Oscar nomination. It's definitely not the best science fiction film of 2001. That honor probably goes to Terminator 2 . The Cell is technically a fantasy film .|0
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season is on my local channel i feel like watching it more, so i can't wait to watch it all over again !! I really don't think I can put into words what i feel watching this show !! Thank you to the show for making me laugh soooo much !! This is the best show on TV right now and it's not because of any special effects, it's just because of how great of a show is.|0
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a great sense of humour and humour ! This is a film I would not miss if you were lucky enough to get hold of a copy - I don't know how long it would take to come out but you will be able to pick this one out when it comes out ! There are some great laughs and the music is great ! I am a big fan of music videos and these are of the highest quality in my opinion and the video quality is really good too !|0
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's 1891 play that was the subject of an Academy award-winning film in 1954. O'Connor and Wilde were in many ways opposites: The former was dark-haired and dark-complexioned while the latter had a light complexion and a long, full, dark beard. O'Connor was an Irish-born, gay man and the daughter of an Irish mother and an English father. Wilde was also openly gay but he also had a dashing reputation with the ladies. Both of them were well-connected and wealthy and both had an intense desire for social acceptance.|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with the follow-up -- New Jack City Strikes Back. In this third installment in the franchise, the titular action hero makes a surprise appearance in South Central Los Angeles in a very familiar guise. It's not that Van Peebles didn't think he could top New Jack City, rather that he was a bit concerned about what type of character he would have next. And in this one, he really was concerned.|0
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But the signs do more than tell us this year is the season for rabbits... They tell us it's time for duck season . Daffy was just a baby when Disney made the Ducktales cartoon starring him. Today he is an action hero who, in his own words , ''is not just for kids, he's for everyone'' who wants to become the next big hero . We've been to a Daffy Duck video shoot before, back when Daffy first became a star to the world.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary about racial tensions and racial discrimination . the story follows a young man on his quest to get revenge for his black friend who murdered his white girlfriend's parents in a racist crime . his white friend's father, who was framed by a corrupt cop , turns out to be an even bigger racist . so , as the story starts , we get to hear the man's racist views for himself as he recounts his story .|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work . You can really feel the fear of what you are about to do as you enter into the story , even though you can't really understand what is going on . The atmosphere/setting is so haunting , that I will definitely be looking for this one when it comes out on Blu Ray . The movie will definitely keep me awake at night ! The first time I saw ""Seizing the Day"" the first thing I noticed is that the director is the same director as in ""The Master"" ."|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's not the sex , though that's very enjoyable , and it's not what we all wanted in a horror movie . It's the relationship . This is why this film is called a love story . But don 't think it has only romance , it has some serious drama , too . A young woman named Susie comes back home to find her father dead . She also finds out that her mother had been murdered by her boyfriend .|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. If you have never seen a space film and are seeking out a good one, check this one out. If you saw it and liked it, I would recommend this one to a friend and they would like it also. It is a little long but not very much. I don't think this film does anything that hasn't been done a thousand times by now, which is why I am glad it is not the last movie on my shelf.|0
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing their own thing at this point , and it does not matter to me what others are doing . For those who don't quite understand my point , here is the one sentence summary : Republicans are dumb , they don't know how to get elected , and so on . The point remains the same : it's not funny anymore , it doesn't matter to anyone, and so it's not going to change . So here's the one thing that I'm really sick of .|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? The kind of movies that made you believe in magic ? When your whole family sat together in the living room after a night of fun and laughter ? It's hard not to wish Disney had been more like that all along . As it is, there's still Disney movies that aren't that much fun to watch, but at least they're at least worth a couple minutes of your day, and they still make you cry a little bit, and even laugh a little bit.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with anything . The one I wanted was The Great Train Robbery (1961) where a man gets in a train with only one ticket and he is on the train and he is killed . There is only one other man and that man is going to get out with one ticket . If the story has any truth to it it should have been written in a book and turned into a film . Anyway , I just couldn't come up with a film to compare this one to .|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The job of protecting the president's office is not a difficult one, but sometimes, when it comes to protecting the president, some people have to be killed. The man responsible is the chief of security himself, Charles Norton. As he and his associates prepare for the president's office to be hit by a nuclear device, the situation gets worse: the president's staff is killed and then the president himself.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all did it really well . and if you don't see this , its because it wasnt meant for you , or youre not a good movie person . the thing about the book and the movie is that they are both very good , but the movie is better than the book in nearly every way . i mean , there are some parts where the movie has way more depth , but the movie is also way better and has a better balance of story lines and character development .|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's probably the A.R. Murugabharan classic , 'Mumbaaiyil'. Murugabharan 's humour, his ability to make everyone and everything relatable, has endeared him to all generations. He has done more for politics than any of the other cartoonists . There 's also a great story behind the cartoon. The story

When he was a young man , Muralidhar was very poor. He had a small patch of land and some money to keep himself fed . He decided to take up a profession that would bring in some revenue ."|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a girl who is the daughter of an Indian chief who also happens to be a prostitute and a drug addict. There is a very touching relationship between the main character and his daughter. If you are looking for some good entertainment, then I recommend you to give a watch of Black Snake Moan which is an Indian comedy-drama film based on a novel written by the famous Urdu writer, Muhammad Rasheed. This film is one of the best Indian cinema movies which was made in 2014.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in particular. His life changes after he has his plane blown up. He finds that he can not get the people involved to admit their mistakes or to see the importance of his efforts to save his life. They refuse to help him even after he shows that he is dying. The movie takes place over the span of 4 days. Jim is forced to take a flight to find his wife and daughter. The flight becomes a nightmare due to bad decisions by the characters.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I had seen her movies before, but she had never starred in a movie like this one. And I will be seeing her more than once . I enjoyed it. I have never seen a movie with her before. And I must say that I thought that this was her best movie. The best movie she has made up to now. She is just too good at it. And I must say that she is a great actress . The acting was excellent.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . I would have enjoyed it , if it was still in the theaters . This is one of the best documentary films of recent times . I had the privilege of watching the film in my local theater . It is a wonderful piece of art . A very thought provoking piece of work . What I found was quite disturbing was the story . It is a true story , that is a bit shocking . It is a true account of what has happened in the mind of a man , who suffered from mental illness .|0
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George as a young person , but the way I see Orry and the way he acted in the movie made me think he was a little too young . The movie also made me think George was a little too immature . I don't think I would go out and watch it again. I think it is a good movie although it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this but it is good for a time. Orry is a little different from George .|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known authority on the East and is certainly the very latest work from a writer who is at once both learned and humane. It is clear and direct. It deals with the problem of the Egyptian as a race in Egypt itself as in other countries in which its influence was felt. In fact, for many years it was felt by many of those concerned that it was the work of this writer which had done the most toward bringing the Egyptians back into touch with the West.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me this show is very attractive , it is very funny , the plot is very simple , it is not complicated , yet very interesting . It has only three characters and they have all their own character. I watched this show as a kid , and now as a young adult , I love it . I really miss the old show , but as I look forward to this new show , so I am very excited .|0
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by her jealous ex-husband Gary ( Paul Reiser), she has to get away from her husband, who has finally decided to murder her. Betty and Gary try to flee the house on their motorcycles, but are chased by a police officer who is on her way to capture Gary. When Betty and Gary stop, they are able to escape from the house. They find themselves being pursued by three men on a motorcycle, each in police uniform.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across this ad for the C-U-B-N-D. I decided to call them and try to get a better price on my car. When I was on the phone they said to call them back at their office. When I went down I spoke to a lady who was really nice. She talked to me like I was a total jerk and I was embarrassed. It was one thing to talk to a woman on the phone, it was another thing to have to deal with her.|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . What a good time ! It was really fun to watch , and it was such a nice movie ! I liked all of the characters , and I like all of the movie . All the actors did a fantastic job . I would definitely see it with my friends ! The movie had a good message , and that's what this movie's all about ! I thought it was really good ! I thought the actors did great job . I would definately watch it with my friends again and again.|0
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , the bandits kill all the policemen on board , and kill the conductor , too. When the train makes it safely back to the railway station , only one policeman survived. The bandits had killed the other one too . The gold shipment that is carried by the train has been insured by the train company for 50,000.000 ( 50 million rupees) . The policeman who survived had taken his chances with the rest and left the train after taking the money.|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to get him some rabbit-meat for the rabbit stew he is cooking. However , Elmer is also out hunting and , when he sees Daffy , Daffy sees him and starts running after him . In the process of running , Elmer gets caught by an angry Bugs Bunny . After Bugs gets through saying a few words of encouragement , Daffy asks Elmer , ""Are you looking for the Rabbit , Elmer?"" Elmer replies, ""I am . But I don't see him ."|0
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another generic cable show , but I did love the look of the show and the characters . It was interesting to see that they made some of the original actors back into the show . I saw it once and was hooked from the start. There was a scene towards the end that I couldn't turn off , so I sat there through it (in my office) until it was over , then came home and watched the whole episode over again .|0
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone else see it ? The movie is nice. I liked a lot of the things that she does in this film. I think I liked her more this time. I love the fact that she gets to wear more of her clothes and that she isn't afraid to wear them or do anything. She really is a pretty woman. Now this movie is a really funny film . A lot of the people who I knew from the comic book series and who I had actually met before in person.|0
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets were scaled down a bit. There really was no point in putting them next to the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building. They could not have been scaled up and they couldn‚Äôt have worked in the theater. Also this is the last film to come out in anamorphic 2.35. The new 2.35 aspect ratio will last through the 80mm process in 35mm and then eventually the 2.40 process when we start using the Panavision process.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking that they made up something on the spot based on what I had said . I think this show is hilarious. I can understand that it's been a while since you watched the show because I'm sure that after seeing it, it will be one of your favorite shows again. The show itself is well written and funny at times. However, the way the characters speak and interact with the other characters is just annoying.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd call the essence of the song without the lyrics. They were trying to show how the song sounded in their head. I think you have captured a little of this with the 'dance' and with the 'sickness' part as they both sound the same but the arrangement of the lyrics are different to my ear. As you say in your song, 'songs don't always make you feel sick, they can make you feel beautiful.'|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema, genre and narrative style for over thirty years. His most recent projects are his three-part Netflix special Herzog, the Mind of the Mountain (2014), the six part Netflix special Herzog of the South Pacific (2016), and the Netflix mini-series Heart of the Sea (2018). His latest film, a thirty year retrospective Herzog: Reflections on Film and Family, is in theaters now. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll be surprised.|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does not shy away from discussing the pain, fear, anger and sorrow of its subject matter. In doing so, the documentary film also reveals the strength of reconciliation and hope for the future of this country which continues to struggle to make the changes needed for the country to move forward. The film explores the aftermath of the 1994 elections in South Africa, the process of reconciliation between different races and religions after a violent campaign of violence and repression in the post-apartheid era.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight , the legendary actor, and his wife are on hand to tell their story . I wish they had stayed on camera for more time . As a result , the film ends up being about 2 hours too short for me . It's just a wonderful story . I hope to see it re-cut to more than 3 hours long so it can be enjoyed for it's full 3 hours and more . This is a wonderful story that I would love to see on the silver screen .|0
"Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not get the impression that the main character was mentally retarded . I thought he was really smart and capable of handling whatever the situation put before him . But that did not stop my family from telling me I was acting like my character in a movie . My father kept saying , ""You see , when I was in school , we would never say anything like that to each other . And my mother would tell us that she did not like him ."|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . I also think it makes a great show. We get to go to a climate conference . There are several panels. One of the panels talks about the need to act on climate . One of the panelists gets to go on stage . She says that if we really want to tackle climate change we need to use the carbon credits . We don't have a way of storing all the carbon we put into the atmosphere and it would be too easy to just put it into the atmosphere .|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the viewers were very upset by the film and the violence , especially the violence against men. The film was very violent , and the message was not that women are bad , as the title would make you think . The film is an excellent example of psychological violence , and the main character does not get the justice she deserves . I could not watch the movie , I am ashamed of what I did to it .|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the weekend and said they enjoyed the history lesson and that they learned more about our past in it. I am not a fan of historicals, but I do love to educate my students on history and so I really enjoyed this one . . . I am a big history buff, but have not seen it all. That being said, this was a great film and I will recommend it to any teacher and the students who would enjoy it as well!|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started as a franchise, but the success of the original ""Friday the 13th"" made them a huge hit, and so the slasher film industry started to grow up around these films. While many of the films and even the sequels, such as ""Chill of the Nights"" and ""Night of the Demons"" (both made in 1978), have been released over the decades, the original made it all the way to #10 on AFI's 100 greatest horror films ."|0
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the movie, it‚Äôs story and characters . But, the acting was a little disappointing for me, I would have have preferred that the actors were not in the roles of the characters they portray . I think that they did a great job , as they did their jobs very well. I would say that if you‚Äôre in search of a great historical fiction film, watch this one ! I would say this is a great movie for those who like historical fiction !|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music, and a new look that brings this much loved classic to life. This is one of those rare films that has been adapted for television and yet transcends the medium. It is not so much an adaptation of The Lion King as an extension of it. The story of Simba, played by newcomer Seth MacFarlane, is so engrossing that you feel as if you have been there watching him grow and learn. It is a magical film, full of love, humor, and heart.|0
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqu√© for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even an understatement . There's not enough words for the experience . The movie is about a boy who goes with his grandfather to see his family . And there's this girl that lives in the house he goes to see. The boy wants to play with this girl so badly but her mother says no . So after a little bit of arguing the boy runs into the woods and runs up to the top of a hill . There he finds this little girl and plays with her .|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 or 5 more times since then . It is a film that is worth seeing in its entirety for the performances in all of it . It doesn 't seem like it should be too much of a surprise to say that one of the characters in the film would be my favorite . I don't know that I could ever say what I like about any other character in this film but I 've seen this movie so many times that I should be able to say what I like about any character at this point .|0

Beware the Beast
A dark comedy from one of the great Australian film directors of the twentieth century , Michael G. Wilson (
The Killing Fields ,
The Castle of Fu Manchung)
In
Beware the Beast we watch a young couple on the run from the authorities."|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes, customs, and social practices of different parts of America, as reflected by their movie stars. It‚Äôs a movie about American movies , but not really about American movies . Instead of talking about Hollywood blockbusters or American directors, it talks about the real life movies of various types of films, that are produced all over America. The movie starts off with interviews with famous filmmakers , discussing their personal experiences on working in America , and also about the films that inspired them .|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a strong cast and excellent supporting work. But as with all good comic book movies the best scenes are when the story and dialogue are put together well, and the acting is excellent. It's not just a film about the Lone Ranger and his horse but a Western about two brothers fighting for the honor of their family. In the second half, you'll also see a side of the Lone Ranger he has not seen before.|0
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , but no one would be surprised by a story of a man with a cane who has lost all of his possessions and is forced to wander the bush looking for food, when suddenly he is offered a piece of land by a woman who is about to be eaten alive by a crocodile. He accepts and takes on the woman‚Äôs two young children and she feeds them, and the crocodile decides it is not hungry.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if the story is realistic. It is so much fun for me to write about the characters‚Äô interactions. In addition to writing stories for my own enjoyment, I now have quite a few writing groups, where I do not only read and read and read again, but also contribute my writing. I‚Äôve read some great authors‚Äô writing and learned so much and am now trying to create some new stories too.|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Canary islands of the southern tip of Africa , is one of his most beautiful and harrowing movies. It is also among his most enigmatic. For those unfamiliar with the film, it is based on the real-life case of the ‚ÄúTWA 7,‚Äù the doomed German airliner which ran into a storm and crashed into a mountain on January 20, 1937, with the loss of all on board. Herzog was inspired by the passengers of TWA 7 as they waited on a ledge for rescue to arrive.|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, C√©dric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as a little girl . I have been thinking about going back to it . If you are looking for the original film , it was only released on dvd , so if you have a copy of it , it may be worth a rental ! I would also like to know what this film is about . I saw this movie when I was 9 years old ! I was not too impressed with it ,but it was great to see this movie with my grandparents as a part of my birthday !|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it on the strength of this review from IMDb. After reading this review, I found that the film seems to be much better acted, and has a better cast, but that it is an inferior movie in some respects. I‚Äôll have to watch the movie again to make sure I am not being unfair. Review:

The movie starts off with Akhenaton on a trip to see a temple with all of the kings and priests."|0
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy. There is nothing I could add that would help his nomination. But for those that want to know, there is no way Chris Diamantopoulos would be nominated without his role as Williams. It was a wonderful performance. I've never seen him before, but I can tell by how he played that part of the character that he was very convincing. It was everything that was right in the character. It was very believable, and he made it very real, and made it his own.|0
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and for all the great work he has made in making people laugh for the past 30 years. What Mel Brooks said about The Producers and its story line, is what he said all of the time , and I would say that this film was the best of his work and it was brilliant. I am very glad that he is still working and he is making other films, because that would be great for America !|0
"The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to get a word in edgeways . If you haven't had a chance to check it out . you should do so. It is really a must read. Author's response

You make such an amazing point. I really wish I could write something like that. Thank you so much. It was a great honor to work with you and we really enjoyed making this book. And thank you for the comment, it made me feel so much better. You are awesome!"|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that I could watch again and say that I 've learned new stuff from it , then this would definitely be it , because I 've learned alot from this movie , but this movie has also made me re-learn a lot from the old times . I just hope that this movie would have made a sequel . I give this one a 7 out of 10 . The acting was good and all , but I can't really praise it any higher .|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. After having seen the original, it is easily the best. I've just finished watching it again, after having not watched it in years. I've re-watched it twice, in the last few weeks, the second time with my dad. We've seen it a couple of times, so I'm well up for it now. (The second time my dad watched it was with me in the room, in my bedroom, on my laptop and the projector.|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children . The story was good but I would have preferred a slightly better animated story . My favourite character was Elmo . He was very well voiced . I've not seen it so I can't give a full opinion . But from my experience I don't think I've seen any animated films that are better in the way they're animated . All the movies that I've seen in the last 5 years are animated , some in a style that is better than what is on display here .|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it all, the plot twists, the surprises, and the sudden revelations, all wrapped up together in a single movie. It has been a tradition in film that is well over 50 years old. Movies have always played a big part in how society views people. Whether it is how society views criminals or how society views gay men or transgender men, we have always known that the movies have had a tremendous influence. There is no denying that without movies, our history might have been different.|0
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody knew him or his films or even his life. He was simply the greatest and most beautiful director of his era . I don't think I'll ever meet anyone who was as good and as beautiful in his own way . And his movies are as beautiful to my eyes as the ones I love . So it is a privilege to have this great man with us at this event . The only way it is possible.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a wealthy widower named Paul (Kevin Costner) , but Paul is married and can‚Äôt marry her unless he divorces his ex-wife Margaret (Cameron Diaz), who has a daughter. I‚Äôll start this by saying that this is probably not going to be the last we see of her in action. I‚Äôm not sure she is as good of a person as I think she is, but I hope she makes it out of this one unscathed.|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie is not particularly good either , but it's the first movie i saw on the new dvd player in my room . Now , this review is mainly about the novel itself . So , let's begin with the good . The story , for me , is quite simple , the story has been written in a way that it can be read easily , so it has been written with the intent to have a simple and straightforward reading .|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is 14 years older than her mother and she can't stand it. They go on a date and after the date her mother asks her how she felt about her date. The girl replies that she liked him because she didn't care for him. Now the mom feels bad and asks her daughter to get her a book that talks about how to deal with a younger man and what you should do to be successful in your life.|0
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure only; it is a psychological thriller. It is also about the search for meaning, which could not be better illustrated by the film‚Äôs title. It is a tribute to those who have sacrificed, and there is no better example of a hero who sacrifices his own self-interest and desires in order to do what he believes in. It is a wonderful tale of heroism, and if you have not seen the film you should get a copy, it is a true classic of a time long gone.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to thriller with aplomb . I was completely swept away from the film and had to watch it over and over . If you haven‚Äôt heard about this movie already , it‚Äôs your lucky day , it‚Äôs one of my all-time favorite films . I love the fact that this movie did not shy away from its dark themes , and explored them at length . The movie takes the viewer on a journey of the dark side and its consequences .|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. Contents

Seasonings can be obtained by talking with a character who has already obtained seasoning in an area, by speaking the name of the character (except in The Great Escape) and by speaking the name of a character that has already used seasoning in an area. Talk with the characters who have already used seasoning to get Seasoning, but remember that they can still use the seasoning as soon as they get the seasoning, just like all the characters who have not yet used seasoning yet can."|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to vamp, I pondered on my life, wondering why I had chosen this life. I knew the reasons for it were good and valid. It would make a nice career and help my family and provide me with the things I would need in life. I was pretty confident of this. However, this film made me doubt myself. While my reasons for choosing a life like that may be valid, I don‚Äôt think it is possible for anyone to be 100% sure of their choices.|0
"When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd hate to think how much money it has cost to get that right. Tuesday, 15 December 2015

My first ever film review for the Guardian

Dear Guardian,
I'm sorry I didn't follow your lead and review the new James Bond movie. However, I've read a great deal about it, so I thought you would want to know
everything I've read about the film, and anything I think it should change. Here are some examples

1."|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, I must say that the music is great. I hope they keep the music in Conrack II. It‚Äôs great to hear the music for the first time. In the US, if you‚Äôre looking to buy the DVD from Amazon, you should get it from Amazon Studios, and it costs $1.29. The US price is $1.69, so it‚Äôll cost you exactly the same in Australia and New Zealand.|0
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time ! What a film ! What a movie ! This film will be remembered for the way it was shot. The cinematography is beautiful, and the special effects are outstanding. What an amazing movie ! It is a must for lovers of movie .The movie is really a great movie .The movie is great. I like it .I think it's an awesome movie .The music is great. This film had a great soundtrack .I liked it .I can't forget it .|0
"In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making documentaries. The director is left to ponder what's really happening, and he decides to make a documentary about his family . The film is called ""The Manchurian Candidate "" (the movie is a play on the film of the same name, which was directed by Terence Malick) . As the film opens , the director is at a loss , with the help of his son . The film was released on February 8, 2013. It was met with mostly positive reviews ."|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me first state that I love to write. I find it very stimulating and cathartic , not just for myself, but also for those whom I read it. I also love watching films. Films are a very powerful medium, that allow the viewer to become immersed in the plot and the characters of the film. When a viewer finds something interesting and unique, he has to express it with his own words, in his own voice. When you make a film, you must feel it.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort in his performance , as a man who has dedicated his life to a pastime he considers an addiction , but is forced to put it aside when he encounters the one thing that could bring him peace of mind and solace in life , a girl . But Chestnut‚Äôs life comes to a stand still , when he learns the truth behind the story he has been forced to abandon , and he is forced to go on a quest to find her , and he does find her , and they fall in love .|0
"I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was really fun to watch. It's also one of a handful of animation films of the day to show up in my list of the ""Top 50 Animated Films of 1994"", and there are few animated films that stand up in my book as a real stand up, and it's a good thing I liked it because it was one of my all time favorites of the year so far. The animation is a lot of fun."|0
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of my review. It is not my goal to get the reader to feel compelled to buy more books; it is my job to give a critical assessment of the books reviewed and to recommend the best. If you cannot accept that there is a huge difference between a ""novelization"" and an adaptation, or that there is a wide disparity between a good novelization and an adaptation, then this review is an exercise in futility."|0
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
"There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Iron Horse . ""The Horse That Dances Like No Horse"" is a story of two horses, one wild and free, one tame and tame-like. There is a scene in The Horse Who Danced Like No Horse where the horses are separated. The wild horse runs and the tame horse stands and waits for his master to return. We see the horse's eyes and ears for the first time: They are small, almost like the eyes of a fox."|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , music , excellent costumes . The whole thing should have been shown on Broadway and in the movies . What did the censors say ? . I agree that the show was good. It was the first time I had seen it (which was years ago when I was a little kid). I do believe it is a great period piece because it really reflects life during the time period. However, I just thought it seemed a little overrated at times.|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds , the man who produced last year‚Äôs critically acclaimed horror film The Cabin in the Woods . Here we meet a family that seems to have been in the family for generations. What we don‚Äôt find out, is just how much we don‚Äôt know about these people, or the family. We follow Betty as she struggles with depression, anger, and paranoia. And as she gets closer and closer to her son, her fears grow.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her cunt, then left the blade to play with her pussy juice and balls. Then he ran the blade back along the length of her cunt and she let out a squealing scream as blood and juice poured out. They had to stop the scene because Alan had run the blade up and down her arse for ten minutes before finally cutting it off completely. It looked like she was about to collapse when she came round.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , and it will definitely keep you coming back for more. The characters are very original and the storyline is a good balance of fantasy and reality. The songs are also awesome and really bring the movie to life. There are so many reasons to love this movie, but a few stand out for me: 1) The music is AWESOME ! I‚Äôve never heard a movie score with so many catchy melodies! It really gets your attention. The music is very upbeat and upbeat.|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the same tone, that was established by King Arthur, which is similar to the novel's opening scene in which Arthur arrives at Camelot after having been on the run for several years, and he has a conversation with Lancelot about their shared history, before King Arthur is struck down and killed. In fact, the scene at the end of King of the Underworld is so similar to King Arthur that it is sometimes labeled as the ""prequel"" of Arthur's story."|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this seems like an interesting question since the film opens with a scene of Tutu asking if anyone would want to talk about their past. the question is not asked as a statement but as a suggestion that they would like to discuss their past in the light of our current life. this makes the question a little different than a statement question which is usually used to test the knowledge of a person. it is more of a question to which the person feels the urge to respond.|0
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest ) and was immediately hooked. It‚Äôs a very fun , lighthearted movie that‚Äôs not easy to watch without laughing, and not so much easy to write about. As a result , it‚Äôs one of the best movies I‚Äôve had the privilege to view in a while. I‚Äôm not going to spoil the ending , and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not going to explain it, so I‚Äôll leave it to you to watch it and to find out.|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . It shows how we all have a choice . It questions our need to blame and the ways we need to be stronger and more accountable than ever before . It will leave you with the ability to understand what it is really like for others to be victims of someone else . . . but it also will make you question how that could happen . I had to turn it off to see if there are any spoilers , but I think that the story is great and well written.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
"An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the focus of the story is , and always have been , the man , or man and the horse . . . . Most of the movie takes place in the open plains of Wyoming and when it moves to the desert , the action takes place on and about the old stage route . . . . ( )

The only problem with this film is that after you watch it you will not want to stop. Randy Quaid plays a sheriff and is one of two lawmen in the film ."|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters. But the story of the movie is far too intriguing for this to be a ‚Äúmovie review.‚Äù And so I thought I would let you know how the film plays out and what my thoughts were after watching it in a theater. Now I‚Äôll get to what the film really about and you‚Äôll get my thoughts about the movie and the story. For now, enjoy the trailer! This is the story of an ancient race of beings who came from another planet to visit Earth.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous music producer. My first impression was not very favorable, but listening to the album made me realize the album was very good indeed and that was what made me change my initial thought. It is still a very enjoyable album and that's a good sign. I am really happy to get to this point where I could finally say I like it. For one thing, you can't say that the music is bad.|0
"Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a little girl who, in an attempt to help her brothers, finds a book entitled ""The Mad Tea Party"" . When she finds the book she reads a chapter, and after reading it she goes to find the Mad Tea Party. There she finds the Mad Tea Party. It is an old story about a man, and a tea party , with a cat. So the first chapter is told in a child's language."|0
"I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule for the week. The story line was pretty good and I enjoyed the actors who played the main characters. Unfortunately, some parts were predictable and didn't flow well. Still, this is one of the better movies of 2008 and I am happy it got a release. My only major complaint about it is the pacing. There were a couple of times I thought ""this isn't going anywhere"" and the pace was so slow I could barely keep up with the story."|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store at the beach and i remembered this movie because at the movie theatre i saw the same poster and at first i thought this film would be similar but when i watched the movie i realized that what they were trying to do was to take a different path in their life and they did and now it's a wonderful story. the characters in the movie were well written and in a very funny way. i was laughing so much at the beginning and then i had to hold my tears until the end.|0
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way as The Edge Of Seventeen. It's the story of three teenage girls who live their lives as they want until one girl, played by the lovely Kate Bosworth, falls for the man who lives down the street; and in the final scene, she runs to the police. I'm a big Kate Bosworth fan so this one was right up my alley and I was very surprised when they said they would make a TV movie of it.|0
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being asked by his daughter to make a movie review of a Broadway play (which he is reviewing himself) while the cast and crew prepare for opening night. After the old man's daughter wins a competition to go on the show, we get to know the cast and crew in a few minutes and see the first performance. We then meet the producer's son, played by Tom Conti in a fine performance. The old man gets a phone call and finds out he has won his prize.|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface-level storytelling . I would go further to say the characters are very shallow and flat. It‚Äôs not a great film for those with an aversion to violent content . It‚Äôs a fun watch for the most part and if you have some disposable income and like your films to appeal to all demographics this is a good film for you . It‚Äôs not my favorite movie of the year but it certainly is an enjoyable one.|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I think that's kind of crazy! I mean, what a waste of money and I'm a little surprised they haven't done away with it. There are some movies like that I want to see the day the DVD comes out and there are a lot I can't because of high ticket prices. I mean, if I have to go out to the theater to see it I'm just going to buy a DVD.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and emotion . I am sorry to say this but , this movie just left me a little speechless . Now , this movie is a must watch . But , I did not watch the last 2/3rd of this movie in order . Just because i wanted to see the climax and then get to the other 3 acts of the movie . If you watch it in order , you will get a better perspective of the movie . I did watch it in order .|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son ¬ñ Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be his last chance. I know it‚Äôs been a while so forgive me if this story is slightly changed from the version you‚Äôve all seen before. Before I begin, I want to share with you a little of who I am and who I am writing this for. If you‚Äôve seen the story about my first show before, you know what you‚Äôre getting into. This is not going to be like the first show.|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , not years , but months ) . The sound effects, the dialogue and the dialogs of all the characters are perfect . The direction and the script is perfect . I am not going to say anything else , at the moment . The plot is fantastic . I loved it. There are several other movies of this genre that have come out this year , I think , but none in the same quality, and none that were as fun as this one .|0
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Seasoning ( 1957 ) is regarded as the quintessential collection of short films for children of the Great Depression era in the USA. These four films are set in the fictitious town of '' Rabbit ' s Hole '' , a place where all children are free to develop their individual talents, but must watch and learn from the older children. They are directed by the prolific film director and director of photography, William Cameron Menzies.|0
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , an entertaining host , a great team of producers and cameramen , a great make up artist , a great fashion model and a great judge who can give the best answer for any kind of question . And then the best thing is to watch it from the comfort of your home without any need to travel to any exotic location . I watched this show from its beginning when I was a young man and then later when I came back to India when I had an opportunity to watch it.|0
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own. Some of you may have a favorite, but I will give you mine. For the purposes of this list you can choose films from a wide array of genre‚Äôs, styles and budgets. To start my list out with the best in the genre‚Äôs of horror, I‚Äôd like to give you my top three picks. I‚Äôm going to go out of my way to discuss each film, why I liked it or disliked it.|0
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it. This was the film I was most excited to see and the one I would most likely see if I was able to see it in theatres. The film was set up, and it played better then I could have hoped it would. It was a fun movie. I didn't like it the way many people seem to like it, however it wasn't the worst movie I have seen all year. It had its moments, although there wasn't any that I could truly latch on to.|0
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in their home country. The film is also an eye opener in terms of the lack of education of students about their rights and their responsibilities. In many ways the movie is an eye-opener in terms of the students` attitude towards life and their attitude towards their future. This is very well made and thought-out film and it is a must watch by all the students to get the true meaning behind Erasmus. This film also has an interesting message in terms of the attitude towards life and what we do with our lives.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a sequel. I think the problem is that Fox didn't realize they couldn't sell a movie that was made on a shoe-in. If that is the case then we are all doomed to a sequel for all the good films that didn't get made. What they should be doing is making two films back to back. The first one should take place 20 years after the events of the first film and the second 20 years after that and they would have a trilogy.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and the actions of US president Richard Nixon and former president Bill Clinton . And the movie focuses heavily on the US government's decision to not prosecute Nixon for Watergate . There are also parallels between the American and Israeli governments, particularly the American Jewish lobby in Israel and the influence that the US and Israel has on the American government . And there are parallels with the rise of Islamic terrorism and its connection with the Arab countries .|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine . They do a pretty good job , but there is a few issues they have that bother me . First, I am a huge fan of the book and the series. But, at the end of the day , I don‚Äôt get how someone like Candice Swanepoel could come in and ruin the movie for me . She is a great actress and a very likable character . But, she seems to come from a different time period .|0
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was another young man in a very similar predicament. In 1989, in the middle of the first Gulf War, Tom Cruise, fresh out of college, joined the army. After two years of basic training at Fort Gordon in Georgia, Cruise was shipped off to Iraq to become an army paratrooper. His fellow soldiers thought him a bit of a joke. He was just 18. But the paratroopers of the 101st airborne division had their own plans for Cruise.|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies ever to hit the silver screen! ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get in a relationship in the Army, because you‚Äôre either in love with one person and there‚Äôs no room for anyone else, or you love one person and it is over. The best you can do is to make out with someone, which is not very nice, but if you‚Äôre honest with yourself, you find something.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , Georgia, we were just there for a day and it was amazing, I was so excited because I had seen some of the films from the show in London before but they had not been on here so I was hoping they would be as good as the other ones were. The show was amazing as it always is and the people were really nice too. My friend and I thought it would be fun to have a costume party as well.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Both are films that would make my top ten list of movies of all time . Unforgiven is the true tale of an outlaw in 1881 , while Tombstone focuses on an old west lawman ( John Ford ) in 1881 . So I think it's interesting to compare them . I'm a big fan of westerns . It doesn't really matter which one I prefer , as there are a great number of great westerns , both good and bad .|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award season. I really don't know how I feel about it being overlooked, but I have had a chance to watch a few of its episodes in its entirety , and found them to be very entertaining . I am glad it won , as the show is not something I can watch on Netflix. However, it has not been my favorite show , so I cannot compare it to something I do like . It is just something I did not enjoy , nor do I like .|0
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? thanks . I'm getting tired of watching this film. I've already watched about 6 or 7 different versions on Youtube, and I don't find any of them enjoyable to watch. There's one I watched a couple of days ago which is so bad, that the only redeeming feature I can see for it is the fact, that the person making it made it. I think this movie is just boring and the only thing I like is the music and some of the scenes in the background.|0
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me and many other kids in my community at the time. Back then, I didn‚Äôt understand how such a film could be able to influence so many, but now I understand that it was an influential piece of literature for so many people at the time. This is an incredible movie that I would urge everyone to take the time to sit and watch it, especially as a young person.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a single word is ever said about this movie. and I mean all that stuff you saw in other movies that they are talking about in this film is just used for comic relief and as filler, but this movie is not just a comedy it is a serious drama , full of love , hate and a little bit of murder, the film is written by a guy who is famous for being a horror writer.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just not exciting but i had to see them so I started to watch the german girls, and then when the american girl started i started watching her, I started watching german girls in general, but I could not get over how sexy the german girls were. The only german girls i watched were the german ones with the American accent. My sister had a friend who always wanted to watch German TV and she wanted to watch a german girl who sounded like me.|0
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is amazing. I love it. I 'm gonna buy the whole series. And I'm gonna buy the audio of it. I'm gonna get it. I love this show! I'm glad I bought it! It's so great! This is one of the best shows that I've ever seen and I'm pretty sure it will be a hit in Europe, especially the UK where I live!|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent and his production company. I'm a fan of this movie but I wasn't expecting to be blown away by it and I think this is my favorite. There are not a million characters in the movie but Sargent manages to get the most important ones. There are very few actors to take center stage but they do have that. The movie has an amazing amount of atmosphere and it is hard to describe. The plot is fairly standard but it still works.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Melbourne, Australia. Though it's just a little rough around the edges, it's still good fun, with lots of characters that are easily recognized. You get the sense, though, that some of the characters would be better suited for the back pages of a comic book or a short story collection. The basic premise is that there is a drug ring running in Kings Cross, with the two primary drug dealers at its center.|0
"Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time , we go out on a romantic date. The movie opens with a voiceover from Jane. She's on a plane and the voiceover says:

""'You don't have to be an artist to be an artist. You just have to look at the world. And not judge it by the rules of the game you are playing, you know. If you can only see beauty where it lies, then that's the beauty, and you are an artist.'"|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just your average comedy . There's a lot of fun to be had with this comedy , and even if it has a few clunky moments , they're the kind of moments that make the film more enjoyable than you think they'd be . That's especially true if you come out of the film having laughed along with every scene . If you haven't seen it , you'd be better off not seeing this comedy .|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends and In a Mirror, My Lord , in In A Mirror, I Am a Killer. It was one thing to make an anti-war film , In The Company of Men (1996) but quite another to do so when you were a war-weary citizen living in Chicago. LaBute had been writing and producing plays and writing for television before making this film. He had also acted and directed television in the early nineties .|0
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am so happy that this movie was made into a movie . It makes you think of a movie that you love . It made me think of some other movies . So if you have not seen this movie and would love to know the ending of the movie you must read the next paragraph. When the movie ends you will remember what you saw and what it meant to you . And it will make your day because you will know the ending .|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something I can put on when I go to bed so that at 4am I won't need an alarm. The book is really good but there are some things that I would not have been able to come up with. However this has made me wonder what else I have missed out. So here are some of things I want to read in the future. This is really good as far as I am concerned because I can read the whole book at one go so it has a lot more of my attention.|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. What I don‚Äôt share with my previous commentator is his desire for a repeat viewing of the film. What I would like to say is that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, including those people who are familiar with it. As far as I am concerned it is the best film ever made. But there are some flaws with this film. It is the type of movie that most people are familiar with in Hollywood and this is the main reason why they enjoy it so much .|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , over budget , poorly scripted , overly acted and badly acted . this is the case with the movies I saw in our local theatre this past week , but it is also the case with the movies you are about to watch . in fact , I know of no better case for this kind of film than this one , as it shows once again that the only good film you'll see on television is the one starring Gene Hackman , Warren Beatty and Anthony Hopkins .|0
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (who died last year) saying how it was one of only two or three PBS shows that she loved. I'm guessing it was another one of them. I'd like to offer a couple of observations:

1) In my experience the PBS schedule is very, very good. I have seen almost every program shown on PBS and I have only seen one or two that I thought were bad. There was nothing that I thought wasn't quite good."|0
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we got so many good points out of this movie but one thing that i will always remember about this movie is my kids loved it so much that when i would put on a different version of it to show them we would have the same thing happen . it really was very cool . This is definitely a movie for everyone. It is so funny and I'm glad that I'm still alive to watch it. My son loves it, and my little girl LOVED it.|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorc√©e who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
"The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Ticket ' ' ''

There are no signs on the roads saying if you don't have a ticket you won't get hurt, but you should be cautious. There are four ways to get a ticket:

- Pay with a ticket- Pay with a non-ticketed item- Use an unlicensed service or business- Use a non-motorized means of travel

- Pay by check

As a person who loves to travel - I will always be careful to ensure that I have a ticket to ride."|0
"This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you . The movie was funny , i loved this movie and my friend loved it too . It was full of humour , love , sex , comedy and some romance . It was amazing . If u want to watch it with ur girl then u have to see it with her because it is really nice . If u want a good movie , u should watch this one

I have read many reviews on this movie and it is really a great movie."|0
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm happy I got to watch it. The first part I was a bit disappointed because the story is a bit boring, but by the end, I found it really interesting and a bit creepy. I would recommend the whole series to people who are looking for an original horror. This is definitely my favorite series on Netflix. This is just a very good movie, even if it wasn't original. It's very interesting to see how they made it look so weird.|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show from the first episode ! this is a super fun show ! for real ! it‚Äôs fun to watch because i really enjoy the music and i think that it‚Äôs super creative. i‚Äôve seen one episode where all the girls are running around in circles, singing songs. it makes me think of being a kid, i‚Äôve been watching this show for many years, but i always loved this one because there‚Äôs a bunch of cool stuff going on in this show.|0
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teen goons terrorize a bunch of helpless college girls. It‚Äôs easy to tell he killed them in cold blood. He seems to be just as ruthless as them. But he isn‚Äôt just a killer; he‚Äôs a survivor. A survivor? In a hotel? This is more than a mere coincidence. There‚Äôs something strange about Jacob Goodnight , something he has been hiding from everyone. He claims to have no memory of his life before he woke up at the old hotel.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , it is well-paced and keeps the mystery alive from the beginning to the end. I thought it was a well done story and would recommend it to mystery readers with any level of experience. What I enjoyed most is the mystery of who is the murderer, and how it is done, because there is so much speculation in the book. I would have preferred a little more explanation and less speculation, because that would have ruined my enjoyment a little.|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in its promise to shed light on how a songbird from a rural background became a multi-million dollar pop star, ‚ÄúKaren‚Äôs Karen‚Äù is an affecting film that proves that anyone can be someone's dream girl, if he or she tries. In the summer of 1967, when young Karen Carpenter was 16 years old, she arrived at an audition for a part in a television variety show. The show‚Äôs producer, however, didn‚Äôt see her potential.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when the train pulls into the sidings outside the western part of the capital. And that is one of the reasons why a group of passengers decided to walk to the border from where they could cross it with a ticket bought at the train. It was a beautiful sunny day, not a sign of winter at that time, when the train reached the border and the passengers began to gather around the ticket office, with the intention of taking the first chance of getting a valid visa.|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her two daughters and the trials of their daily lives . This show is a work of genius . The acting is outstanding , the writing is top notch and the plots are full of surprises . I loved every minute of this show , and can't wait to see what's next. A very good show. It was fun to watch and laugh and it made me think of what it's like to go through what the women in the story are going through.|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . The film was made in 2004 but did not make the festival circuit, but did get picked up by a distributor and was going to be distributed to theaters around the country.. The film won the best film, best music video, best original score, best short film and best sound editing awards at the festival. I was so glad I saw it on opening weekend. I had read the script by the director, Mark L. Smith at the time.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game in his hometown to get his act together. On a hot summer‚Äôs day in California, when he‚Äôll be forced to play on the other side of the country in California, Ryan is determined to make it in a hostile environment with his teammates. Unfortunately, his teammates have a way of turning the heat up on him as soon as the game begins. A few years back, I read a young adult book with a very cool twist.|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors , I can't think of another movie with a more beautiful soundtrack . This is easily one of my favorite movies in recent memory and it's the perfect movie for anyone who is into music videos, or anyone who loves movies that look a lot like music videos . This soundtrack alone would have me buying a copy of the original movie . The film itself is an excellent story about a music video artist and his struggles to make it in the music video business .|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one small town, where she became a local celebrity for the crime she committed against the community. As with all true stories there are many twists and turns along the way. A woman is killed in a small town that is run by the local mayor. People blame her for the death. The local paper blames her for causing the death. The local police blame her for letting the man get the best of her.|0
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , a man of simple words with a simple mind that has a sharp wit. I have seen a lot of stand up shows. I find Kevin James to be the best because he can be serious and make fun of anyone at anytime. In his show I found some of his jokes to be very effective. In my opinion there are very few stand up comics today that can be as funny as James . He is one of my favorites . The story line was also good.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Friedan's book has been the book for me since I was 5. I remember the way my mom told us to never read the book. ""Why would you read this book. It's all bad. And if you do read it you will be worse off for having read it."" That's when my mother told us we could never read this book . The book was the start of a nightmare in our life for the next 30 years or so."|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
"This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world of New York City. The film follows the ups and downs of the career and personal lives of three young women who live and work as book publishers. The film explores the highs and lows of marriage and divorce. It is an emotional film about love and family. This film has been described as a ‚Äòtouching study of a group of women whose stories are told on the screen for the benefit of others.‚Äô

Synopsis

A group of women with careers in publishing, whose lives are intersected by their friendships."|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy for the eyes in those days ..... Thats why most movies were boring and the audience lost interest to it . Movies are a reflection of the society and people who are alive and living in that time . The movie is a good piece of story and it has a great plot . But i would say that the ending was not good . i would like to hear the opinions from everyone about the movie . I will say this. This movie was not only based on a true story.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogot√°, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply awesome! This concert will make you realize why I have been so thrilled to live here in California and I have loved it. The city of Berkeley is the place to live for it is the most interesting, artistic and tolerant city that I have seen in a few years. So many people come from all around to enjoy a good performance here. It just goes to show how wonderful the city of Berkeley is! I hope to see you all there!|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great movie that should have been a great commercial success , but in the end, was not . The acting is superb , the story is great and the film is worth your time . It has the right mixture of action , suspense , and romance . I would recommend it to you and it would give you hours of enjoyment . In my opinion , it is a must see movie . If you haven''t seen ``Just Before Dawn '' in theaters yet, then get your tickets as soon as you can .|0
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe I've told myself it's nothing to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is. Fata Morgana is a beautiful thing. It's a place of wonder in a very beautiful world. A place where the stars still twinkle, the moon still glows and the wind is still sweet. But sometimes it's not all that beautiful. There are the people who don't really know what is going on. The people who think they know, but they don't.|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I really wanted to love it but it was not for me , it was not what I expected and I was not impressed by any of the characters . But the film did have a lot of things about it I liked and some that I did not . I was also disappointed with the ending of the film , I really wanted to end on a positive note but the ending of the film , in my opinion , was one of the weakest parts of the movie .|0
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series out there in its class. . . and it‚Äôs even available on Amazon , which is where I‚Äôm putting all my money for books . You have to be a fan of the TV series or the movies to truly love this book . You have to have an appreciation for the beauty of Planet Earth , for the majesty of the seas and mountains . You have to have a sense of awe for the world .|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost '' ) says he believes he'll win a $ 1 million jackpot playing Texas Holdem. The only problem? He says he's been a little too eager. He hasn't put any of his chips into the pot yet. It's the latest in a line of brain-teasing riddles in the `` Land of the Lost'' syndicated game show. One question, for instance, posed by host Larry Hagman of ABC's `` Dallas '': `` Who would win a fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman?|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to find the man responsible for a string of recent deaths, but in order to do this, he must discover the identity of the serial killer. The only problem is that there are too many people willing to tell him, and he soon begins to realize the truth of the matter. He soon finds himself being pulled in many directions in a race against time and the police, all the while being hunted by a dangerous and cunning killer who has never been seen in public.|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds, but also opened the mind of the audience. It was funny , exciting, a lot of potential to develop and bring to the next step and it did. The characters and their storyline were a lot of comedy , but they also could be serious and it was a story that could be followed and it was very exciting. The show went to air in 2007 and I was only 16 when i watched that first episode but i was so excited i could hardly sit down to watch it.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's when I was able to go on holiday to various parts of Europe. It was a trip that taught me that Europe is very, very different from the USA. That is, I have friends who will tell me stories of the differences. The European way. But for the sake of this story, let‚Äôs go to the movies and see what the world really is like... I had the opportunity to see a movie a couple of months ago.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone was talking about it. We were just shooting , and I think the movie is as good today as it was then , and even today is better than it was then , because of how much we worked in editing . But I did not realize how much people were enjoying the movie at the time . And it was my first film in color , and that is not an easy thing to do because I don't think anyone in America had seen color films in color at the time . ''|0
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in the city. As the story unfolds it becomes a story about the people on the street, and the film takes us inside that world, exploring all of its intricacies. At the core, there are two separate stories, but they are linked and intertwining, as are the lives of the three men who inhabit it ‚Äì a group of brothers who have made a pact to survive and build a life without the outside influences that have taken over their childhoods.|0
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this film. I believe the reason is that it was a great film in the first place, and when you take a step back and analyse the film from a different perspective you can start to appreciate it much more. I found this film so very moving. I had seen this film the previous year, and when I saw this version of it, my heart went out to this man, as I thought about what he would be going through.|0
"The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 70¬ís and was amazed at how it was written by a single person and performed by a single actor. It was created and performed by Bob Carroll , who was also one half of the group that recorded the original version, `` Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an Uncut Version . """" Bob Carroll was born on August 28, 1938 in New Jersey. His parents lived in Florida when they met. His mother was a singer."|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot to learn about our country and life and how things happen and how a person has to deal with it or not. This book is really a good book in the right direction. I really enjoyed reading it but it is not a must read. But a good to keep for the ones who really want to know what life is like in India. I am sure there are lot of new readers who will really enjoy reading this book and would like to know a lot about life in india.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
"It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , the wife is selfish , the couple is unhappy . The kids are bored . The parents are at odds . I 'll bet it 's the same in life. Monday, July 16, 2013

Today I decided to watch a '50s movie , and I 'm not going to make a review. Instead, I 'm going to share my thoughts on the movie , and some of my favorite quotes from the movie . I 'll also mention some of the plot points ."|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogot√° and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into a new way of dealing with issues of racism and stereotyping, that most films have been guilty of. Van Peebles as a black man is very convincing in the roles he plays throughout the film and it gives us a glimpse into other cultures and the way of life that exists there. This is a film that we all need to make sure we get out to see , because it is the first movie that really touches on these issues that we all need to face.|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Fordham has ever been. He was the first of his generation to make what has come to be known as the Ford-era documentary , and his first film is something like a proto-documentary in every respect. And the fact is that it is so. Not that he is a particularly great documentary filmmaker, or that he doesn't often have the best ideas in the world, or that he isn't, in his way, the greatest filmmaker in America today.|0
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . I thought it was funny at the time . But I am not sure if what I saw in my eyes was as funny to others as it was to me as a child. Now that I see it in french, I feel that there is more to say about it. But at the very least , I found this film to be entertaining and I think it was well put together. I would like to see the movie version in english with an english soundtrack and I think it would be even better.|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to see it again in the 90's with a friend who is also an expert on movies and who also told me I was wrong in my appraisal of the film back then. Now he says it's one of the best films ever made, a masterpiece. And he's right. I saw it as a kid with my mother and father and sister (who was about 8 at the time) but I have seen it in its entirety multiple times now and it's still one of my favorites.|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again as a mature adult, it's always a good idea to remember where you were at the time, so that you don't miss anything. I'm glad I took this film so much to heart as I've seen it all before, and I can always watch it without thinking twice. I'll be seeing this film at our next trip to see a movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this film holds up as I watch it over the next few weeks and months.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex , and violence. I don't think the film gets enough credit for having some real depth in it. But, I have to say that it's not very good , I have seen better . But, the scene with the two old men and one of them with his back against a tree is just really sad to watch. __________________
It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to say something and remove all doubt."|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 I have for some other reviews. After a couple of days of not being able to read the title , I finally finished it . The story is about how you grow up , and why you grow old , and why life in America is so much more difficult than in other countries , and what you can learn from being old , and how things change , but still stay the same until you die , as well as many other philosophical things.|0
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the movie is the back of the head and the head of one of the guys in the band . After that , we see the back , front of the head, back, and the head again . This is what you have to expect if you watch this movie . What makes it even more amusing is the fact that they didn't have to change the shot to a cartoon . It could have been any random shot from the movie .|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actresses in his film. As a director, he was at his best when he could use a strong leading woman as a foil or a mirror for his male actors. As a woman , he could use them as a mirror or foil only to the extent his own ego allowed. As in all his films that are not written for men, there is no strong leading lady in this one. It is not the first time when he failed to find one .|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . A year later I saw it for the first time, again at the Double Bay. From then on it was on every Saturday afternoon at 6.30 p.m. when I was growing up with my dad and brothers and sisters. Every Saturday afternoon my father sat us down and turned on the record player and we watched it together . It was an amazing movie, I‚Äôll never forget it, and then it was taken off the market .|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten foot pole ! I know the story is a tad dated now but back then the poster had the poster artist and writer on the cover! The artist had just won the British art contest, but was too poor to pay the full prize money. As a result she won only half the prize, but she wanted the prize money and was determined to have it all! She wrote the story about Nurse Betty as well as the illustration and the poster.|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . These are the first time I have seen an episode of Full House that actually had me laughing. I‚Äôm not going to say they are funny , I‚Äôll let the viewers decide. I am going to say that this episode is the funniest in the entire show . It is a comedy episode , it is a funny episode , and it is full of heart . I think that I may actually watch the next episode when it airs .|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed by it . The performances were decent I think , but it just felt kind of dull in parts . The ending is just about the worst you could possibly get with a biopic . It felt more like a TV pilot than a true film . It didn‚Äôt have any of the depth and richness of a real documentary , but I do understand why it did . If this film had been made a year or two earlier , it could have been amazing .|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the clich√© cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of this one) I can feel that Season 12 will not be so simple as the other 9 seasons. There was just too much complexity to it which makes it even more satisfying to see it through. I liked that Season 11 had a lot of character developments, which were brought to their full development. But now it is time to show that character development in Season 12 and I can definitely say Season 11 was the best episode of Season 12.|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this on Netflix and it is worth the watch

I saw a documentary once that I really enjoyed. It was a very good documentary and I enjoyed it. I won't go too in depth about this one because it is a long one. It was about a very interesting subject. It was the story of Jack Kerouac and the story of his wife. I won't go through the entire documentary. It was very good."|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen would have wanted to get it out there while their grief and sorrow was at its peak before it had to be. I'm glad I saw it. It is very sad that Richard Carpenter lost a dear friend. He had been such a good friend of mine for so many years and I will miss him tremendously. I'm so sorry for the loss of Karen Carpenter. I have never met Richard Carpenter but have seen his movies over the years, and he was always a good person.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist of Radio City Records in the 1970's, I had a personal interest in the career of Bob Fosse, the legendary musical director of that theater. It was not until I discovered Bob Fosse that I discovered that the film Fosse! was in fact about him. That's what I had to do to keep from getting sued! Thursday, April 27, 2013

The first film I ever went to see was the 1964 version of The Sound of Music."|0
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting the desired emotional response in its readership. A great short and I will definitely read more of your work. I just read your review, I‚Äôve also read some of your short stories and really enjoy them, but they‚Äôre not the same! I don‚Äôt read much fantasy, but I enjoy your writing enough to try and read all of your work! Thank you! I‚Äôll let you know how it goes! Great short!|0

I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during my lunch and I accidentally stumbled on the main channel , I thought I should try to watch it . After a couple of minutes , I had my mind set to this , I wanted to learn what all this was about , because I really wanted to understand what is the real meaning behind it .

I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie that had me smiling. In fact, not a single scene made me laugh or even grin. If you don't think that is true , you are simply wrong. I did not like the story. The plot was too simplistic, lacking in the emotional depth I expected in a film about love. What was missing was an ending. And the film had one, but was not the appropriate one for me.|0
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which was then known as the `60s , when it was the only show to make it on to television from year to year. The show is a story of the American Civil Rights Movement from Birmingham, Alabama, through to the end of the 1950's when it was in conflict with the government. It is a story of two African American men, Robert Kennedy, Sr. and his son, Senator Robert Kennedy, as they make their way through the trials of the civil rights movement.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , which is responsible for the world's largest international resettlement program, the officer asks his superiors for permission to re-offend Alex, and promises he will do all he can to stop him. A few days later Dirk returns home to an empty apartment and tells his mother that his father is sick and that he is moving to Africa to take care of him, where he will be the only son.|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses it feels that the relationship between the two is not being shown. Spanky and his crew arrive in an island where the only people that are left alive on the entire island have no fear of fire or water because no one wants to leave, so when Spanky gets on the island, it is the only place on earth that he will never leave again. When Spanky finds out that the other people have no fear of fire or water, he becomes the leader of the people.|0
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a very well done film . All the acting is good . I thought the story was great . The screenplay was great .

The special effects were also great . I would recommend this to anyone . It really made a difference in my life . This was such a great movie .|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary and her friend arrive at a small village school to discover an extraordinary play is being performed for children. The play is written by a man who's never had children. But it doesn't matter that the play has never had children. The children are already having their fun with the script. They are the audience, the actors, the performers. The play will have the children as actors. The actors as actors. Every one of them will have their own unique voice.|0

It has good cinematography, good costumes , lighting , good special effects, well-shot and edited .|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , every single episode and all the original artwork . There's a couple episodes that have been lost over the years but I'm pretty sure they'll be rereleased if they ever happen . For all the die hard fans that may not have seen all episodes, and for the die hard Dads, it's a show you don't have to worry about spoilers . You're going to love the Dads Army (or should I say the Dads Army) for all it's heart wrenching episodes .|0
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in the French press . The book, written by two young French poets and published by Grasset, recounts the life of a group of people who, for various reasons, decided to move to Spain in the aftermath of World War II. It's a fascinating and often funny tale. And at the very end of the book, a young woman writes a letter in response to the epilogue by an elderly woman, who recalls her own time in exile in Spain.|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Train ' by Allan Dwan . Both were made in the same year under the direction of Fred C. Bronson as 'The Man from the Black Hills ' and William Alland as ' Wagon Train ' . It was the second western, the first being 'Red River ' in 1944 . 'Gunfighter' was the second western to be made by a director other than William Alland , although he had been in production since the early thirties for MGM . The Gunfighter and ' Wagon Train ' both opened in July and September of 1950 .|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clich√©s about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast , and , for once , you don't get bored , even at 2 1/2 - 3 hours long . It's one of the most creative and original films of the 1980's . It is a very long movie , and not very much happens in the first part , except a lot of people dying in gruesome ways . In fact , the whole movie is based on one man's vision of a new type of future society .|0
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic forum for making a fool of himself. This is a masterwork of what comic animation should be. I could not get enough of this and I hope I never run out of the characters, story line and art of this amazing cartoon. I can't believe people are still so ignorant about what they are watching and how much they enjoy watching it. The only reason I haven't gone out and ordered more episodes is because of how expensive it gets to watch it.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I think the whole thing is quite clever ! A film of this calibre cannot be ignored in my opinion. And it is quite possible that it could grow legs and become bigger than ever before. It's an exciting time to be a fan of cinema . A time when we will get to see a whole new generation of talent emerge on the world cinema scene and a time when the possibilities of the medium are unlimited .|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is arguably the best movie that I have ever watched ! The movie is set in a beach town called Thailand and although I was familiar with the location, this is the first time I have ever seen the movie. I don't remember much of the movie except for the opening and ending ... but that's about all I can remember ... but I am glad I saw it because there were many scenes that I thought were quite good.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that I find intriguing... and it's hard not to love it! I've always been very interested in the role of the ""good guy."" I've always felt that there is something about this role that I want to play. There's nothing like being a good guy... but also something like being a bad guy... I feel like there is a power about being ""good"" and a power about being ""bad."""|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock ¬ñ though as foul-mouthed as usual ¬ñ is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress. She is the heroine of our movie. She is looking for love. She goes and falls in love with the guy. But the guy doesn‚Äôt accept her love. He just ignores her love. This is the story of this movie. She loves him very much. He accepts her love. They are married. This is the end of the story. Amy Jo Johnson is one of the actors in our movie.|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who builds the perfect pet for humans. It's a dog that can't talk and a cat that just wants to eat. Cats and dogs can be very similar. Both are carnivorous and, like us humans, are attracted to water. They also both like to talk. They are both also very friendly to humans. But unlike humans, dogs can talk and dogs cannot talk. There are two reasons for this.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following a series of murders on the eve of a national elections . What's more, the plot itself is one that would make even the most diehard horror fan jump at the screen in horror-related fear ; the plot is basically one of two stories that run parallel to one another , with most of the story being set in a small town in India and the main story is set somewhere in the US, where it appears the killings took place .|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for a wave of films made by women in the 1950s and 1960s . The success of these women inspired more to join the ranks of mothers and grandmothers . There was a boom in films that reflected a woman's experiences in a society that had yet to give her a place in the public arena. In this series I will post the most popular films made about mothers in America. For each episode I will provide a list of the featured mothers , their films and the date they were produced.|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White horse that he was playing , it is evident that he loves his country and loves the music . He is a real patriot , and if he wants to give back, he would have to do it with his body , not his talent , and he will be doing that by raising a son with Down syndrome. I know this because this is his story. Growing up in rural Tennessee , Brewer was raised with music on the radio .|0
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I watched it I went with the family to see it at a local movie theatre. When we left the lobby I noticed the posters on each wall were all art films, so I asked my father why he put those up, and he said they all were art films. So that is why it made me curious. The film is about the life of a man who was a street artist during the 60s. It was shot on film by people who loved him as an artist.|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. I think it‚Äôs one of the few movies that can make you smile and cry simultaneously. So what makes it so special? What makes a movie a ‚Äòmovie‚Äô? If it can make me cry and make me smile, then why is it a movie? I would love to find out. This film is probably the closest that a film can ever get to a real story ‚Äì and to a life.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch. But alas, that is where the film ends up. * * SPOILERS AHEAD * * No, wait. That is where the movie ends up! * * SPOILERS AHEAD * * Now, on to the movie itself. Let us take it from where it left off:* *

The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for most of us the best of everything happens to be what is not as good as everything else . We live in a society where we all like to be on top but it is also a society where we are all on top of the world . We like the top but we know that it does not mean that all is good but what is the best of everything is good . This is an age when the top and the bottom of the world are the same and when the top is not the best .|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford had to rely on his imagination , that is , his eye , to help him draw the characters and the events. It's as if you're sitting in the room of a great movie director . You can see his vision in the way a character moves, the way a story is told, the way lights are arranged and the way the camera position works. But at times, you may forget that it's only a picture.|0
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn as an arrogant, self-absorbed guy and by Sarah Jessica Parker as his over-sexed, underpaid secretary . Forget about the fact that it is in 3D. But don't worry, we're going to cover the plot anyway. The point is that The 40-Year-Old Virgin may be a great film, but it is also the least interesting movie about masturbation. At the film's center, is Vince Vaughn as Marky Mark, a guy who has a lot of confidence and knows how to make people laugh.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right , the world is safe again, and you just believe him . There 's a new superman in town - and he is a hero - but you 're no hero , you just a coward . Superman is super, you are not . And in the end you just go home and cry and hope that you won 't have to go through life like this . There is no way to fix this , there is no silver bullet .|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional distress. And I couldn't help to be amused by the film, which seemed to me an ""intrigue"" between two people who didn't know each other before, and who became friends when their lives went to the point of falling apart. There was one moment, for example, where a man is walking his dog down a road and the dog chases his own shadow, which the man has drawn on the ground with a marker."|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 10th , I really was surprised to see how well it was presented and how many episodes it had! ( I think that was the most I have ever been surprised in a TV show! )I thought the series was well thought out and well written and I really enjoyed the first episode. But I wanted to like it a bit more, as it went on I was surprised again by the amount of plot twists , and it got a little too predictable .|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the project. It's nice to have someone in the film industry who actually cares about women and I really appreciate her courage to take a stand about something. It has a huge impact in the lives of the girls and I am really glad that she took the responsibility to make this film. She is a very talented woman and this is a very important film for her. The movie is a must watch for all cinema lovers. Go watch and support Aparna Sen.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and just a perfect movie that you have to see to believe .This movie is very touching, emotional and heartwarming . It made me cry on many different occasions . It made me wish I had never lost my virginity . This movie was very touching. I saw it once again after having been through the whole movie about three times and I saw the same thing over and over again which was soooo true. I was so touched. It made me cry.|0
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago . . . I couldn't believe my luck . . . I saw a lot of French films in my youth , but not that one . . . I saw this movie again in Paris in 2005 and I was surprised and happy because I had never seen it before. I saw it again a year or two ago in France, and I was surprised because it was in French , but not in its original version . . .|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts and talks the same way.. You can not find more honest and real person you can find anywhere in this world.. He does not act like he is the greatest of all the guys in WWE.. You can feel and hear what he think and what he say.. When he talks about the guys in WWE, he tells you what he feel to them.. I do not think that any one could be better than this guy. You can go and ask him yourself .|0
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i don't see a huge amount of it , with that said i still find the show a fun way to pass time . The last 3-4 episodes of E! 's "" Next Top Model"" were more than a "" fun way "" to pass the time , it actually helped me get my resume ready for my job search and gave me some of the skills i used on the show . I think the producers should give the show a bit more time for it to sink in with viewers ."|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America, in the 1960s. You may or may not remember the time in the mid- to late-60s when New York City became the world capital of the ‚Äúnew art,‚Äù the counterculture movement of young people (I mean ‚Äúyoung‚Äù as well as ‚Äúart,‚Äù because it was also a movement of ideas). In short, it all came to a head in the art world in 1964. Like most people, I found the movie hard to swallow.|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have any plot , it has no dialogue . It also doesn't follow a traditional narrative . The story revolves around a series of accidents that happen to a group of guys who are out in the desert. But they've been thrown in together by fate . They have no choice but to find a way out , because the only way is to help them find some kind of normalcy. In short , you're on your own with Herzog , which is exactly what makes this film so special .|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into the next one and I was thinking about how I feel about this, so I went into it again, and here's my thoughts. This is going to be so hard to write. I don't know where to start, it's so hard. I can't help myself from thinking about the fact that it's going to be hard and I need to just stop thinking about it. The way I've always tried to do things and just write about it.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. As they walk, you‚Äôre looking out at the ocean and you‚Äôre thinking that you‚Äôre so happy for them, that you‚Äôll never have a reason to envy anyone else in life. You see, you love them; you‚Äôre so grateful to be on their side, to be on the right side, that you don‚Äôt really care about the politics of it.|0
"Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines a sense of place and a sense of community. The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment on 1st December 2006. The film is available on dvd and on Blu-Ray as of the 1st February 2012. This film has been shown at film festivals worldwide. It was also nominated for a number of ""Best Picture of 2005"" awards, including the ""Australian Film Institute (AFI) Award of Merit for Outstanding Achievement at the AFI awards."""|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning in 2002 to the movies end in 2015. He/she/it has the address and phone number and other data. I am so sorry to hear about Mithali's tragic passing. It is heartbreaking to lose someone so young. The family are very grateful for all the messages of support from so many people all over. We hope you get back to Mithali soon. I have been following Mithali for over a year now now. I first saw his work in his music videos on YouTube where I thought he looked quite interesting.|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore and her family move from Seattle to Iowa to be close to her father who has just been appointed Governor . As they settle in with the family , the life they have been led is not exactly what they expected . After a few years the family is faced by the tragic death of Rory‚Äôs mother . It seems that Lorelai will be left on her own, but her father has found a role for her to play and he has a plan for her .|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple questions that I have. So without further adieu lets dive into this review shall we? I have to admit I'm a bit skeptical at the beginning but the more I read, the more I really enjoyed this game. If you haven't read the synopsis of this game then you can check that out. I'm also a bit skeptical at the beginning but then I read reviews by other reviewers and found them interesting and I think that is what really makes me more curious about these types of games.|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a lot in her . She was very bold , she didn‚Äôt give respect to anyone . she was an adventurous girl. She had her own style . I liked the way she had courage in her , she didn‚Äôt feel shy. Rose didn‚Äôt need any help to accomplish her mission. She was independent. She knew her own mind, she thought for herself. I really like her character . It was like a role played by a real person , not an actor.|0
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands , '' can be crude, but it rarely is : if it can''t , then '' it '' isn't. But what if there is an abuser , and we ''re not talking about a bad movie , a movie with bad actors , or a movie with good actors ? '' That's what it means to be '' Jaded'' , and it means more to be a Jaded fan than a ''Jaded'' movie .|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
"The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art, Society and Science or as dealing with love and sex. In any case I think that it is always interesting, especially in the context of the plays I have just finished reading ‚Äì The Tempest by William Shakespeare

One of my favourite performances of the play by the actor Stephen Fry has been filmed in a version by the Royal Shakespeare Company and it is fascinating to compare what is said on stage with the way it is delivered by the actor."|0
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ? `` `` Yes , but I need you ! Can you stand ? Yes , but can you walk ? No , I 'm no hero ! I can only tell stories ! I can only tell lies !`` `` You 're the greatest storyteller of all the great storytellers . `` '' And then , you were born . `` `` Yes , you were born !`` '' And then , you started to tell stories .|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year. It‚Äôs hard to get into this one. Now, this isn‚Äôt really a new film. This film has been seen on many occasions. But this film was controversial from the start. There was even a petition on the Whitehouse website. So I thought it was time to bring it out for all of our readers to see and judge from their own personal points-of-view. Now before we get started, here‚Äôs a little bit about the film.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and fun to watch.Is like a lot of the movies I watch in Colombian, I know some are better, I just like the ones here. I am not a fan of a lot of this movie. But I am enjoying this one. I think it was the first movie of this series that I watched. And I enjoyed it, and found it fun. There were a lot of things in this movie I didn‚Äôt know about, so I have to say it was very good.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably lingered on the periphery of our memory. That it's a good film doesn't seem to have entered the picture until a few years ago, and when it did, it didn't seem a good movie at all. It was as if the director had wandered into the wrong movie theater. He was a master of dark and lurid mood-setting, but he was not, in his prime, a great visual storyteller.|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
