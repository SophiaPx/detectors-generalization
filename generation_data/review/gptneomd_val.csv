I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me it made sense and was a little different . I didn't think it would work but it has . There are some people who don't care and don't understand it . I have some issues with it . I would like it to change and make some people more comfortable with what I have to say . If it's possible I would love to hear some of your opinions . I would love to know what you thought of the show . I would like to keep it alive .|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy, but instead it’s just a film with too many ideas and too many characters to be enjoyed by an audience of adults. That is, it’s not a bad film, but it is a film that can’t quite decide which of its many ideas it has a handle on. There is a lot of fun to be had. But it’s not just kids who can’t seem to figure this movie out.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 24-27, 2001, on TV Land , I’m thrilled. This is the first time I can remember seeing it as a series. I was aware of the show in a handful of re-runs here and there, but that was the only time that I’d seen it, so this is quite a treat for me. If you haven’t already, please head on over and watch this. I think it’s a must.|0
"Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teen girls are living 
in 
a run down motel room . He has an ax , he runs around in his nightie and he kills . The police find these girls 
dead , 
and they think that there may be another killer on the loose , but he has never shown up , they just assume 
that he is a ghost . One night they hear a baby crying , and then the next night they see it , and this 
is 
all it takes for one of the girls to go crazy ."|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's 'Jai Ho.' The story of a girl who has to be saved from a terrible fate that is destined for her. In an effort to save her life, she agrees to be 'Jai hoed' meaning she will be sacrificed to the god of fire. In the meantime, the people around her are forced to come to the realization that there is more behind the story than just the fate of a girl.|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. It is so very well made and thought through that it’s impossible not to like it. It’s hard to imagine this film being anywhere near as good as the movie it is based on, a true crime story by Mike Newell. This is a film that doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of a mystery or a murder or a crime. In the film all you can focus on is a film set in the late 1950s and 60s.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Wheels ' by Richard Connell. The latter being a very unusual and exciting one, due to its being the first Western film shot on location. The former, 'The Gunfighter ' is set in modern times, while 'Wagon Wheels' is in the 1930s. They were produced simultaneously, and both were highly successful, particularly in the United States. The Gunfighter was also well received in France and Germany, while in Britain, the film is considered to be a flop.|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to make them. The problem is that John Ford is dead. There was a film called ``John Ford, the big, blockbuster star '' and the movie is available on DVD and it is worth watching for the movie itself, but you should be aware that it doesn't show what Ford did as a movie maker, nor is it shown what he would have been like as a director had he been able to make it.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore has just started college at the prestigious Yale University . When she moves out to stay at home with her dad , her plans to get a job working as an office assistant is dashed . Instead she finds herself in a series of crazy events that leave her with a new sense of humor ! It is one of the most endearing television shows of recent years. This is the sixth movie in the "" Gilmore Girls"" TV series, the third one in a row to feature Lorelai as a series regular."|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show the moment i heard the theme song. it was a beautiful piece of work, and i love when they have such a beautiful piece of work with a good story to it. i am happy that they had the theme song to their show. i can't help it when they are so awesome. and i am super excited to see what happens. i just hope i am able to get a date with the guy who has a date with me !|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to deliver a shipment of cocaine to a rival drug cartel. But what exactly he is transporting is unknown, and as he heads back into the city he stumbles across an unusual opportunity: an elderly street urchin ( Mariah Carey ) and a group of young kids, all of whom are suffering the consequences of a freak accident. It has been a year since the accident, and the kids are finally starting to forget about the incident.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to share them with my readers here, and I hope it's one that will bring some smile to your face this Christmas as you are all waiting for Christmas. I am all for giving kids the opportunity to laugh and joke with each other as well as just having a laugh. BOING is a fun cartoon with a twist as it goes back to back, as you are going back to school and you are new to boing.|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , they end up killing the king of the tribe who is riding along . The story is told through flashbacks as it shows the train's history with the bandits . It is based on the novel "" The Jewel of the Nile "" by R. A. Scott . The story also tells about the life of the hero who is trying to help in the robbery . In the end , the story is concluded with the events that happened before the events ."|0
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Hunting ( 1953 ) are among the first and most accomplished films to combine a Western with a science fiction plot. Like most of the other Rabbit series, this one is well-written and acted and is, in some ways, better than the first three films because it follows a clearly defined genre. However, it is also one of the least interesting films in that the science fiction elements come in later in the movie. Like the original Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning was written by John Frawley.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure if it 's a mouse or a rat or maybe a monkey. But he knows he can 't stand it much longer. There 's something in his hands that 's got him in its grip now. He 's determined to get out with it. But how? Easily. As always, Elmer has his plan. First, he 's got to figure out what 's in the cage. Then he has to get in. And, once in the cage, there 's one thing he has to do.|0
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with the other pieces found at the Cairo Museum. The scene from the tomb of Khufu is very evocative. This is the tomb where he is said to be the first ruler of Egypt, his father having reigned over the country for about fifty years, after whom he was said to reign over the country for a further thirty-five. The tomb is clearly of a building that was rather grand by today standards. It is also the burial place of a number of rulers including Ramses I and Ramses II.|0
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This is a work of the highest integrity . I find it hard to imagine a more interesting, or more beautiful , film . This film was made with one of Australia's first colour TV's , one of the first color VCR's and probably one of the first colour Super VHS's . I think I will be the first one to admit I was not able to watch this film in colour , but if I was an Australian I'm sure it would work .|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this that just doesn't seem to fit. I don't see what it could be, other than a complete waste of the audience's time. So I'll wait for a re-release, but I'll probably just see this film again when it hits cinemas around the time it was released, for the DVD release of the movie (which will happen in a few days) and the Blu Ray, which should come in around the time I see the film again.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of more questions. The other day I was looking for a book and found a pile of it on the shelf. This is a good book with a lot of thought and depth to it. It is not just one thing, it's the sum of all those pieces that make it up. But it doesn't do justice to the subject matter in one go, which is why so many people seem to complain that this or that book is not worthy enough.|0
"This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , the tension and suspense. I am sure that this will become a favourite of yours. Also, I don't think this entry is really bad in the way that you might expect, in fact, quite the opposite - I am glad that I managed to catch it in the second viewing! Author Notes:

I was pleased with the book when I read it the first time, so I decided to give it a second read - I think, after the first read it is still a very good story."|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should of replaced all of the songs in the movies . and they should of removed all the songs from the movie . its a great movie but you can never find a song in Disney Channel they play all the songs at the same moment . This movie is the best and most realistic movie you can see with Disney Channel . You won't be disappointed . I recommend this movie to everyone and everybody . it is worth of seeing with Disney Channel .|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time . He is a marvel of comedy . I have never been a big fan of Mel Brooks, his movies are a complete disaster , I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that subject, but he does make some funny movies, and they do make some money. This movie has a lot of humor in it. The problem is it seems to be more about how the main characters think and feel in life than how they actually live out their lives as a result.|0
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) for a buck, and it was worth it. It's basically an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice by Austen. The only difference is, it's all over the place. You can't just watch it straight, because it starts with Jane Austen saying that it's too cold to go to the pub, and then goes through the whole plot of the book. I didn't find it too bad though, and the actors all seemed very well behaved, even though there is some swearing.|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the cartoon is at the very start . The next shot is at the beginning , again . The third one is at the middle . And then again at the end . This is just the beginning of the cartoon . Then it will get funny . Then funny . Then hilarious . Then the punchlines will come . And so on . We get to the end of the cartoon and they are still talking nonsense . But by now you have got bored of it .|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. The other two are The Pinkertons and Mr. Magoo. They're all great and I highly recommend checking them out and reading their comments on each other here. But there's a third series out there with Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck, and this one's called 'Bugs Rabbit/Elmer Fudd'. The 'Bugs' of that series are Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd and Daffy Duck and they can't all agree on where the hell they are on the spectrum.|0
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is now a beautiful, if not quite large, beach front property overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Our home sits high atop the beach with incredible ocean views from all sides. We are on our 3rd floor, so the view is incredible, but we have also added a 2nd level of rooms for a total of 6 people. This home is equipped with a well equipped gourmet kitchen and dining area. There is also a nice sized backyard.|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface-level performances from the cast. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in the US, but is not an American classic, although it has some elements of the Americana feel to it. The movie is in the style of a true crime book, which for this purpose, is a very good thing. It is told in the first person, which makes it a very personal film, and because it is set in 1970 it feels very real, which is fitting for an American crime film.|0
"Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? Disney movies are some of the best entertainment you will ever watch ! Disney movies are not only the reason to be there but it is also the reason to come back every year ! The latest Disney film ""Cinderella"" which is directed and written by a woman is the best example ! Cinderella is a classic movie with wonderful songs which are loved by almost all audiences. In fact the film has become a great love song of the entire world."|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile and weak minded parents . It was the first movie I ever saw that got me to start thinking about our parents as well. I don’t believe anyone has a better movie to open our eyes to how fragile we’re actually made up. This is a great documentary that makes you wonder if you’ll ever find the strength to become strong yourself. This is a beautiful film that shows you that it is really hard being the child of a parent who is broken.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and it's a classic movie in the horror genre that manages to be very entertaining . I like that a lot about this movie is the way it portrays the effects of drugs and alcohol . It is a classic thriller movie . I was surprised by how well written the screenplay for the story was . The film has a great story line and keeps the audience very interested until the very end . This is a movie that will have you wanting to read the next book in this series .|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it ! You can't buy it . Just see ! It 's for the people . See what we can do . . .' It 's what we all dream about . . . You 've got to see it ! And so here it is, as it's meant to be seen, on all digital devices, or in any format, from your desktop to the palm of your hand or from your mobile to the screen of your computer.|0
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the entire movie which is not filled with emotions, suspense, love and loss. Its a movie which has a lot of emotions from start to the end . But the best thing is that it was an awesome movie. I loved this movie, and I did not get bored throughout the movie . I just loved the characters in the movie and I really liked the storyline. One of my friends told me that I am going to like this movie because it was the one which I had in mind .|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger, that I still haven't been able to find again. A film that really doesn't hold back and shows us all how it was all supposed to be. It was a masterpiece, one I wish I was in the audience right now. It's a film I will never forget. I wish it would have stayed longer but I am so sad it was over so soon. A film that I can still look back on and recall so many things.|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn what they are supposed to do and then work to realize these ideals, but there are a few problems with how this was going. First, the young generation is often seen to have the same goals as those of older people, and there seems to be a tendency to say “no, we can” to the younger people. But in reality, younger people have a much more realistic view of what it takes to get where they would want to be with their lives than a lot of older people.|0
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who is determined to find a man. But first she will need to go on the quest to find that man. She needs to travel the world to find him. There will be many adventures to try to get to that one man who could change her life. ''The Legend of Korra'' '' (Korra) is an American animated television series produced by Nickelodeon, and aired on Nickelodeon from April 8, 2009 to May 26, 2013.|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a HUGE fan of the book ( and now that you mention it I 've also watched it in the past ) . The book was awesome and just a great story . This movie took a little while to develop and was a bit slow but worth it . The actors did a good job and I was surprised by how well written and acted this movie was . I 'm not sure if I 'll get around to this movie for awhile , but it was still a good movie.|0
"Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a better way out of every problem as we know it, but as Aparnaji himself points out in his book, the best solution lies somewhere else. But, there are so many things we are trying to accomplish at one level of the organization, that we just can't seem to find a solution to. We seem to have no solutions for the following problems:

1. There is a shortage of good people to work here."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing, great music. Very entertaining movie which had many great elements. It was well acted, well directed and well acted. It is also a good film with some nice scenes. A good movie to go see. It is not a sequel. It doesn’t have all the same things from the other movies. However there is still a lot of good stuff in the film. It is also a very nice film with some good suspense scenes.|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity , or an issue or a political candidate , and to a great degree they have. For example, when a celebrity or a politician speaks, we listen to them because they sound intelligent , interesting , or smart , and if they say something that we think is wrong , or is against our morals or our way of thinking … we are going to agree with them and our opinion of them is going to grow .|0
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , crocodile killers etc. I have to say the Australian media have been doing a good job at highlighting crocodile hunting but it does not get as much attention as if the same were done in Africa or Asia. I thought I would put a few clips of crocodile hunting on my blog and see what kind of response it is. The clips are below. I would like to know if you would like to watch the clips or have any ideas for other clips I should be posting.|0
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went and saw it again recently to see how I remembered it ... ive seen all the movies in question and they all have this same theme, and im pretty sure that is the theme to the movie . Ive read alot about the movie , but cant recall the details . Theres no way I could ever forget it or not . Im just a bit skeptical that theres something wrong . ive been trying to think of it , as i think its pretty much what i thought the plot was about .|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theater. The reason I’m bringing this up is not because it doesn’t deserve to be discussed, but because some people think it deserves a re-make or remake. The film is based on a best seller by John Grisham, The Firm, in which he chronicles his years as an agent for one of the biggest law firms in America. He is tasked with uncovering a scandal involving a high-ranking executive who was caught stealing money from the company.|0
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The security firm hired him on a temporary basis in order to assess the threat from a new type of threat. The firm is currently under threat of being acquired by another large security company, which means Mr. Eure’s job will no longer be secure. The firm hired Mr. Eure because of the threat to its existence. But the threat is also to his life as a man, as he will be forced out of a job he has worked for the security company for two years now.|0
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against British oppression. As part of the campaign to liberate the Confederacy, GENERAL SPANKY and his troops are frequently forced to flee or surrender by the local population. General Spanky and his troops were always the last to surrender, because he was the last man left on the field, and he wanted to surrender so that his men, and especially his wounded, would be left behind, and not have to endure further humiliation and indignities.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to prove he's not mentally handicapped. While it's funny on the surface, it's really a joke, and it only serves to make it even more annoying that we now have to deal with mental health issues and Tourette as well. In reality, this is just a continuation of the same joke from the past 2 seasons and season 10. The only real difference this season compared to previous is Cartman was actually diagnosed, with the only difference being he wasn't treated for Tourette at all.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait until the day I can get cable for all my family . But since I do not have it yet . I can still get my family on cable . Now I need to see what kind of deals are available this time around . I can get my family on a great deal. They have several channels like HBO , Cinemax , Food networks, and CNN . But I need to know how good is it. They offer me more channels for $10 a month than I can ever get for free.|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Megan Fox ) to go into the desert and collect crystals for the Mormon church . But the crystals are actually fake, and it’s up to the Mormons to get the real ones. It also stars Ben Johnson . This is one of our favorite films of last year, and the trailer for it was a great start to the film. This film comes from the creators of the first two films. I think they have a very different kind of film.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV show and I'm not gonna be impressed by it. After all , I'm not a movie fan , but this TV show has got so much wrong with it and it seems to me that this film is gonna be just another lame movie to pass time. I was expecting the movie to be better , but I'm very disappointed to see this as it was not at all. The only good thing about this film is that it is about to come out on DVD as well.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . I have that feeling about all her albums and I don't know what to do with it . . . Maybe if I could listen to them when they were recorded , and I could hear the way they were meant to be heard , maybe I could see the world through their lens . . . I would like to listen to her records , but it feels like listening to a dream that is about to happen . Karen Carpenter, singer, songwriter, composer.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a lot going on. The production values are pretty decent considering that it was filmed on 16 mm. The plot is not the best, but we get the feeling that it was made to be enjoyable for kids. There's some nice humor here and a good story to tell. The characterizations are good but the story doesn't really gel with them at first. The acting is decent and is not overdone.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired and the CGI is not good in the slightest) so I decided to have a bash at reviewing it. So, here goes.. So, here we have an action packed film that is in the mold of the old martial art flicks. It all seems very familiar, but I really enjoyed this movie. I don’t mind the style, it’s just a shame that the fights are so dull.|0
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous composer, whose name is currently being withheld for legal reasons. This composer, in fact, has worked with many of the biggest stars of our time in his numerous compositions. I decided that I wanted to use this young composer's name, and so I contacted him and asked him to take part in my video and to give me some tips of his work, and also to give me some advice on how to promote his compositions.|0
"First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing it because they think it will make them look better. It will never make them look bad. It will probably backfire because some people will believe the joke , some will laugh and others will not understand it. So what you think will happen , if it is taken seriously ? No, because people will think it funny and they will laugh. Some will be offended by it because it is ""offensive"". So what will happen when people laugh in your face, or at your face ?"|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because when I was at a show, I usually didn't get out to get my food , I got home , and by the time I got back , dinner had been prepared. It's been great for me to get out to restaurants. I'm going back to it next week for the second time. The food is good as well. I'll have to bring some back to the house as well so we can share it . The service is great as well .|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film follows a young woman with a past that she hasn’t been able to forget. As she meets a new nurse, she learns to trust that this new person will also bring happiness and peace. What’s been done wrong? All of us. We have tried too much. We have failed too badly. It’s time we all learn how to be happy and fulfilled, and to stop being miserable and unhappy because of it.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford had no idea who was doing it . It was an interesting little film because of the way that it was made. It was shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras , which is not easy to do. But Ford was determined that his camera work was to be good , not perfect , and he produced what he considered to be a great film. In order to get good pictures , one had to shoot from a very specific spot in a very narrow corridor.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad. This week he’s in for a doozy thanks to The Social Network. I have to say, I think it is a little too good for us mere mortals to watch. It was the most anticipated film of 2011 and if you think I’ve seen anything in the past few months that was a fluke, then you should see this one. The Social Network is about a group of people who meet at a bar and get together to share their dreams.|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that showed that the way to move forward is to do everything you can with the knowledge you already have you could do everything with this movie. This was a very cool movie! The first one I saw I remember was the first part of it, the part about the alien invasion. I wish it had lasted longer. This was an awesome story. It's about a guy who finds himself in the middle of some alien invasion.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead, please !? What's up ? '' How are you ? How 've I been ? How 've you been ? Hey ! Hey ! It's okay ! I don't know anything ! Can you explain to me how I am ? Come on , explain ! Come on , tell me what 's the matter ? I'm afraid of this guy ! Is he going to hit me ? He won't ! What he said ! Yes ! What ?|0
Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of the ``Tear 'n' Makeup Show'' . We begin with some basic makeup tricks to try to give you an idea of how they might look on you . You get a chance to look in the mirror and make up like you are in a makeup room . `` I want to look like a teenager '' is a phrase that seems to be a favorite of yours . You think you might as well get to look like an older woman .|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I have enough time to enjoy every single scene in them. I've had a lot of time to enjoy them and so I'm glad I finally started. The first thing I thought is, what kind of heroine do I have? There are some great heroines out there and so many of them don't seem to be my cup of tea (and that's my own fault) but here are a few I've been looking for for awhile.|0
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
"King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , smart, and always has a good story to tell . If you know anything about Kevin James then you should read this comic . The comic has a good message and has been making the rounds in theaters . The first time I heard it was at the film festival and was so good that it made me cry. I hope that more people go out and see it. Check it out. Share this: Twitter

spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with an action-packed sequel, and went on to achieve a remarkable 20 Oscar nominations -- including six wins -- and a record-breaking box-office haul. After making his directorial debut with this film, Van Peebles had to wait nearly a decade to receive his biggest accolade, when he received a career-best supporting actor award at the 1994 ceremony for his performance in this film. Alfonso Alonzo was born June 16th, 1955 in Los Angeles , California . As a child he enjoyed watching films with his family.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and inspired, as well as those of us who have had similar experiences and would like to share our own. If you find yourself enjoying a film in this way, I hope you’ll watch it again. Thursday, June 14, 2008

It’s been a while since I watched any of my friends’ films and I think that I’m going to enjoy myself again this weekend. Last weekend, we went to a festival of film in London."|0

"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to win a Best Actress award at a Oscars ceremony . It is a pity they were not allowed to share the Best Actor and Best Director award for The Lion King with Josh Hutcherson and Dave Franco respectively. In the end all the awards went to people with less screen time than the Best Actor winner . Best Costume Design

Avery Goodrich was in a good mood in this movie . The costumes are very modern and well-done. They could not have done anything worse but they did not have to in this movie ."|0
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . If you are a fan of movies , you can easily watch this film and enjoy it as the movie is quite good. Synopsis : In the year 2077 , a nuclear war between Russia and the USA leads to a worldwide nuclear conflict . The leader of the human resistance force, Dr. Franklin D. Roosevelt , the only survivor of the attack , sets up a resistance army to fight against the new enemies of the world. The film begins with Dr. Roosevelt’s inauguration into office .|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which a man is seen standing in the middle of a group of people walking through the woods . He sees his family in the background . His family were looking down at him . In the movie the father of the family , father in law and brother of the guy in the movie , says he wants to know the reason behind this . The whole thing starts from there ! The reason why the guy has the same problem is because of a guy that got killed in a war !|0
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) as a present for myself . It is absolutely fantastic !! There are over 300 tunes on the CD , all from all the Golden Records and Golden Classics and i really do recommend this to you all , if you have any interest in this wonderful music , i can assure you , you will feel the same as when you were a kid ! It is available from Amazon , iTunes , Amazon Music , and as a download too ! You will never find another collection of this quality and variety.|0
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and saw it with my cousin . The story was great . I didn't have the foggiest idea of the ending . I thought it went wrong . It did . The first couple of films were pretty good , the second was ok . I guess it could have been a lot worse . I really don't know why I thought the movie would end the way it did . Maybe it was the way they told the story ? I don't really remember anymore .|0
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? I mean they both had some very different and unique styles from acting . I don't think i'm the only one to notice that , and i don't really see how they can be compared to each other . But I just thought that if we were talking about this, it makes sense that they would have some similarities . I think that if someone would have said it, i think they would agree with it , and it's just an excuse to compare two different styles of acting !|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . I don't know how I felt after watching the first two parts . I didn't like the style in which it was made . It had very little of the impact I had hoped for . The film did have quite a few laughs . It had a few good lines and I liked it . It was a very entertaining film . The only bad thing is that it was quite long and it seemed a shame to cut it so early . I don't really understand this film .|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now that I have a firm grasp on how it works. I have done all three. I am sure there are things I could have left out, or I have not thought of, so I thought I’d include them as a list. I’m going to start with the longest running and the most popular, Perry. Perry is one of the few sitcoms I enjoyed very much, and I had a lot of trouble deciding which to pick.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the actors to give the same performance as real life characters, director Rian Johnson is building a film that explores what it means to love someone with all their heart, without compromise. Johnson is taking us on a journey that will end with the one-two punch: an unexpected kiss and an unexpected love. It’s almost too good to be true! 51 Birch Street opens on January 15th, 2017. You can read the trailer below.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less obvious when we remember that it’s not easy to get to know them as people, because they tend to present themselves as such in order to manipulate their way to success. What are they interested in and what do they need from me ? For example, this person (and there are lots of them) is obviously not interested in anything I could possibly offer, but then, I’ve never worked with many people, so that’s probably not a surprise !|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the failure to a poor production , or you can look back on the original source materials that were used and see how they were used to achieve the effects , and how they were executed well . I have tried to work this film back into what was in the original source material and to see if the same can be done to get the results you see in the film . I have not tried to recreate the original source material .|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the summer and we watched it again and again . We have our own version of this movie and we think it is funny and a really great choice for family movies . The only problem we have is we have no one that actually watched it . I am wondering if anyone would be kind enough to answer some of these questions that may come up :-

1. Do you think we would like this movie if we could watch it at the theatre or home on video ?"|0
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 for its ability to be thought provoking and fun, but I 'd give it 5 for its quality of acting . The acting of this movie is absolutely fantastic , all of it superbly performed . I love how the lead character and the two main antagonists are played with such ease , and also how they act with such confidence . The only thing that bothers me , is how we are treated to a lot of the background noises , especially during some of the movie scenes .|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
"I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of a sex addict. I have seen the trailer and was like "" this is hot"" and it was hot. This is what I was expecting from the trailer as well. I'm definitely going to see it. The cast is pretty good. I saw this movie last weekend and the reviews I read for it was all very good, but there was one reviewer who gave it one star and said "" I don't see what they did to the story""."|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and have them stop selling this movie. I am sure they could use some extra cash and not have to sell the rights to the rights of the original story. I would be willing to give them all the money in my wallet if they were to give me the original story. I'm not even going to argue with you guys. I just feel so bad that a good movie would be lost. I'm glad this movie isn't being marketed by Disney.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe the movie industry was not a very big thing for a long time, but this is something that I am proud of because it shows that there are a big number of human beings who are happy. I am proud of this because when I saw this movie I was actually crying . I was really sad . I wanted to do things for my family and all the friends I had, but I knew that I just couldn't do that because I knew what I was going to do afterwards.|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the former Yugoslavia and now available in English subtitles, was made on behalf of the US State Department's Refugee and Immigrant Services (RIS) program. The film tells the true story of American journalist Fata Morgana, who became the first American woman to flee war-torn Yugoslavia and then move to Switzerland, where she lived as a writer and cultural activist for the next thirty years. In the process, she became the object of hatred from her former fellow countrymen, and as her story unfolded, so too did her image.|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw this movie with a friend last night and it was a great experience . It had a lot of laughs and a few moments of suspense . I will be back for the sequel , I was really looking forward to this one , and I hope it lives up to the first one . I can't say much of any kind about this particular film because I didn't read the review before I watched it , I don't know how you could do that.|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite films. It may not have been the most ambitious film out there (although it was close) but one thing it had was a great script by Ford and the performances of the two stars of the cast. To me, the movie was a mixture of humor and drama but a good enough blend to make for a great vehicle for the stars. A couple of years ago , Wagon Master came back to the theaters on the big screen and it is a good time to watch this movie again.|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music , and an interesting premise . In fact, it's the only one that I'm aware of that is truly exceptional . . . and, in addition, the only one that doesn't have it's flaws . . . I love this book. I really, really do. I would recommend it. It's a book that deserves a place on your shelf, and you should know about it . . . . I loved it from the start.|0
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . You don't go anywhere without a hat or coat or a sweater on . You're not trying to look cool or trendy . You're not trying to have a certain kind of coolness or style that's in vogue and you're not trying to go to the gym or work out because you feel like you need it. You're just you . That's what you think you're doing and it's what everyone else is doing too .|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate all in the name of friendship. I have never seen this movie before and I have watched it several times over the years but I still have not been able to understand how this movie can end up doing so well. From start to the final scene, this movie was amazing. The whole movie was so heart wrenching and I cried so hard. I can honestly say that I have not cried so hard since this movie started.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , it's very simple , it tells you what's happening in the world . And when the movie ends , one has to ask who's in control of the universe . It's a very simple story , a very simple movie . But it does a great job of telling the truth , the real story of a time period . I think it is the one of the greatest movies of all time and one of my favorite westerns.|0
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in the world . This game is amazing and is the most fun game ever . I played this game for a year or two . This game is like a dream game and I have been waiting for one game like this for a year . I can say this is a must game for anyone who likes action , action , action , and this game is so addictive and has amazing graphics in which you will never want to stop playing this game .|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. When I was a very little girl I had to go to the playground after school with my friend and my best friend because my parents had to work that day and they told me that it was the last day of the week so they would have to go to work that weekend. The first thing we were told, in my little mind, was that we would be walking to school together. I was so excited.|0
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the star of the show , this is a Western with lots of charm and action , this one has to be seen to be believed. A very enjoyable romp through the western lands of Texas with a wonderful cast . This one is one of the finest westerns i have ever seen with lots of great characters and great action . One of the best westerns I've seen in ages , great characters and great acting , the film is fun to watch but not too difficult to take in .|0
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 1989. It was a big surprise when I saw it on the silver screen. It has become one of the most iconic films of my generation. In this clip from the movie, we are taken to the home of the rich and famous and see the chaos and chaos ensue in a large mansion. There are servants, and servants, and servants. There are children running around. There are dogs, dogs, running everywhere.|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up With That! '' moment in the way it portrays life in the Deep South. The author, who died in 1993, became famous as a young newspaper man in the Mississippi Delta before going into journalism at the University of South Alabama. Conroy's memoir includes a series of poignant and funny anecdotes that are as true as they come. The most memorable comes from his first-year stint working at the University of Mississippi Delta Times, the university paper in Jackson, Miss.|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award ceremony. In the time I have not watched the first 5 seasons (I am not a TV gush), there has never been a major change to the main cast of characters. In addition, with the release of the second season of King of Queens, I was not sure what was happening with the main storyline. As of now, the story line has changed significantly. I do not feel King of Queens will continue the same story line that they have been with in the 1st.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , I think we all know what the game is all about but this is what we got , well i hope we all enjoy . I have watched the first 5 games. I like the show but I did not get into the game. After I got home from work I went to my computer and found this . I thought I had lost it because of the fact that I can not figure out what the game is or if I still have it but I found it.|0
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store and the girl had a crush on the customer in the back , so she started making up a fake profile of him . so one day she asked to him to go to his place with her to get a drink of water when he told her what happened . so the next day she was going to his place with another friend , but when they came there , they found out that this man was the one she wanted to get drunk .|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
"i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? is there a way i can buy this on air ? what else do you guys think i can do to get it on air ? pls reply

As a fan of this TV show i was hoping i could get it on VH1 but they say it is now in the library and i cant get into it unless i get it on VH1

I got the DVD's of this on VH1 but I don't know how I can get it in my country."|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it came before Moses, Moses was a young man. This was before the Exodus and before the Ark of the Covenant was taken by the Israelites from Egypt. This was when Moses had to be sent to the Pharaoh to see if the Ark was properly hidden. This was before Pharaoh had given the order to kill the Jews. This was before the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God, the first five Commandments are found in the Torah.|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . It's not the best movie that you will find out, but I thought this movie would be a good place to learn about French culture, to understand why it is so popular in France , to see how the french love food , and to see some of the cultural aspects of this film . Here we go:

The French people are an independent people who have their own language, and they live with a certain respect for life."|0
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in New York. This is because of the film's subject matter, a New York-set romance about a young couple caught in the grip of love who must find ways to save their marriage, all the while dealing with the demands of their respective bosses in the city. And while the setting of Park Avenue was originally thought to be in the East End of Manhattan, that has not been confirmed. We will find out more about this film's setting later in the day.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But it can be hard to keep the rabbit rabbits out of the duck's food supply. What can you do about this? Well, the solution is, in fact, fairly simple: you just have to be sure you're feeding them what you want. According to some experts, the rabbit isn't just a tasty morsel for human consumption. A rabbit can actually be a healthy food. They can help keep your dog from being sick if they're not properly fed.|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , we were always allowed to go on a camping trip to the nearby lake with our dad. When my dad died , I decided to take my younger sister to the lake. We were there all summer . The lake water was crystal clear and the fishing was good. My daughter and her best friend were very adventurous and I was very impressed with their adventurous behavior. I had a couple of my buddies with me and I took my girlfriend and my daughter with me.|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an awesome movie , but what's more important to me is how it was produced and what were the actors . The scene in the hotel room , at the beginning of the movie you could just tell that it was about to start . I think it was either a commercial or an advertisement for the hotel . I mean , that's the first time a man was naked . I really enjoyed it . And you should . You could watch it on your ipod touch .|0
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody in our time has ever been as important as his work as his work . And his last great work . Cukor was an important figure in Hollywood for a lot of years. There is no shortage of talk about his life and career. Even the movie critic Roger Ebert has weighed in with some thoughts about the legacy of Cukor . While most of Cukor’s work is out of print for most of his career, his influence is not .|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled herself. She really is someone you can put a lot of trust in. I will be watching for her career to grow and for the rest of her show to continue the direction it was going before. She is a very intelligent woman and has always been that way. It is great to see her in a show that she is not so familiar to. I am looking forward to see what kind of impact she can have on the rest of the cast too.|0
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw it in a theatre. I am sure you will enjoy it. My review will be here as well

So, it's not a new thing that a father and son must work together to raise their kids. I think that's pretty normal. I was raised in the same way. My father worked at the hospital where my mom worked when she married my dad. And he would take care of the home while my mom would be gone and he'd stay at home."|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld and Friends. And it's not just that most of the episodes are repeats, or that there aren't any real surprises, the biggest problem is that all this time and money have been poured into an overblown concept that isn't very original or interesting. In any of the past few seasons it would have been great to see a new approach to the main cast (except perhaps Jerry). And now that it's over, I don't know what's gonna happen.|0
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the theatre last weekend and that's all there is to it. There's no depth, no drama, no heart etc...it's just a film of a certain time, and with no heart at all in it. This is a film of a certain genre, but you don't really have time to get emotionally involved with this kind of story because it's all just there on screen . You only see it in a few scenes here and there, so you can't get caught up in it.|0
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could have taken this show and made it GREAT , but they chose to keep the quality down . What it really comes down to is , the music is great and they need to continue it. It doesn't matter how good the dancing, it just matters if the songs are well done . The problem is , they don't do it well . The first two songs were fine . The rest were just terrible . So what .|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must have led. Jodie Foster gets all the glory for one of the greatest performances ever by a film director. She's also pretty good at directing. I was very happy to watch the movie because the actors were excellent. The script was amazing, the direction was perfect, the acting was perfect and the cinematography was just plain beautiful. If you're looking for a great film this is it. I recommend this movie to all movie lovers.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them but with all due respect, I would hope that we can enjoy it as much as others. I think that we all deserve it. No matter the sport, no matter the major and whether it is the NCAA, WNBA, NFL, NBA, NFL, NHL, NHL or anything else. That is the way it has to be. We have to appreciate all the experiences we have and be thankful for them.|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures that i saw in this movie are so cool that i have been thinking for quite some years . But now i have to tell you something .. I am absolutely astonished . So you can just imagine my first thought , my first thought after i watched this movie . The main reason for me to watch this movie is the first time i really get to hear the music . So here it is . The first song is a very beautiful song that i am so excited .|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's a story about a couple of teenagers who go out on a trip and fall in love . They spend the night together in a tent . After the night , they start to fall apart . That's why you can 't watch the movie alone , it 's a touching movie . The story 's great and it 's the right amount of romantic , comedy , and drama . I would recommend it to any girl that is looking for a really good movie that 's a romantic comedy , that has a great ending .|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who decides to bring his dog from the dead. What's in a name? The dog is named Garfield. Why a dog? There are plenty of good dogs out there who are great family dogs, and this is just one of the great dogs in the history of dogs. So why is it called Garfield? I don't remember the name of any of the great dogs out there (I'm not a dog owner at the moment), but this is the way it should be.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his next book . I loved to read , and I would buy as much as I could . However , I always wanted a bigger house and I didn’t know how to get one . It seemed impossible to me that I would ever be able to fit in a large home . It took me about a year before we were able to move in . It was then when I started looking into houses for sale that my husband suggested that we look for a house for sale close to our current home .|0
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great thriller. It is about a mother and her two sons who escape a home invasion and are stuck in a house. They find the house turned upside down and they are rescued by the mother’s brother who was killed in his own home invasion. What follows in the second half of the movie, is the mother, father and her two sons in a struggle to survive and keep their sanity in a situation they cannot control.|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a political statement to push for one of two things : the end to white apartheid or the continuation of it. This article is in no way intended to push for a specific outcome or position on the issue of truth and reconciliation. It is merely presenting facts that have come out in the media. The Truth and Reconciliation commission is an organization which was established in the 1990's to address the legacy of the Apartheid regime. The primary goal of the commission is to investigate the state of the nation.|0
"A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of people of the USA and people in Europe at a time in American history when nationalism was at it’s height. It also focuses heavily on a couple who have to make a decision between their life and their religion. A lot of people have been asking, what is this American thing? and why does it bother them? It is a good question and one that I think has a simple answer:

USA The Movie

USA The Movie was produced and directed by Joe Swanberg."|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is in college and has a boyfriend. While at first glance it seemed like it was all going great, the mother had a second daughter who didn’t turn out like her. The mother’s first daughter died of breast cancer after her mom tried to raise her alone. And now the second daughter has the same kind of cancer. She’s about to have her breast removed, and she wants someone to go through with the surgery and breast removal.|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right. It 's none other than The Walking Dead . But unlike the famous zombie apocalypse TV show that is currently in its 10th season, this new killer is more than just undead. The first season of this TV series, which begins filming this Fall, is also set in the DC Comics ' universe, and the show is a comic book origin story about an unlikely hero . So what exactly are you looking at? Is the show set in Washington D.C. or something else?|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are looking for the best mules. After the traders are hired, they set off with the mules and head back to Utah to sell the mules. During the journey, they go into a cave and are ambushed by a large group of Indians. The horses are all killed but two are left behind. The settlers take the two horses and go back to Utah to sell the two horses to the Indians. The next day the settlers find that the Indian have taken one of the horses.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a man but also a time machine . In a way it's more like a work of art than just any other book. But it's not a book , and it isn't a book of fiction or even of history . It's a work of architecture, a way of seeing the world that is more than simply the way the mind works . At its best it's about seeing and understanding a whole world and its people on a deeper level than the one that we normally take for granted.|0
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a very different feeling to that of watching it the first time, mainly due to the way in which the story was handled, and more so because the actors were good enough to convey the character they had played. I believe this is the first time that an Indian Film has been screened in Singapore, which I think tells us a few things. Firstly, the film is good. It has excellent performances and great direction and I think the film is a worthy addition to my collection.|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again after you’ve gotten older, you see it as it was as a teenager, as a young man, as a teen. I’ve seen it both ways as a kid, and I’ve been in the same position as you are, where I watch it again as an adult. It’s a very interesting experience and I think I’m getting better and better with it every time I watch something.|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . There is a reason why the word “psychic” is a household word . The movie has a dark side to it and is a disturbing story . When you think about it, it actually makes a good story . There was a woman who was in her 20s and was married to a very wealthy man . She was looking to get a divorce and so the two went to the local attorney who had her file for the divorce .|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It’s not often we are afforded the opportunity to do something on such a grand scale . This book was so important to our history . I have been told by so many people that it was our first book published and that it was the first book written about us, that it was a seminal work . I’m not sure if you know it or not but it is not the first African American published book. But it was important . It had to be .|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point for any film enthusiast. I think that if you don’t have seen this movie and don’t want to miss anything you will find the same kind of enjoyment that this film has to offer . In this movie there is so many action sequences that it is difficult to discuss all the action scenes in a single article but I hope to do that later . For now I want to focus only on the highlights of the action sequences.|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year-old Anna to elude her rapist and his friends in the hope she will get out of Sydney and never return to live with her parents. A desperate and lonely girl. She is living with her family in Sydney , Australia . Her dad has been injured in a car accident and she has been forced to move in with her ungrateful stepmom, who is very sick. She is also being pressured to live with the step-dad of the girl’s friend , a drug dealer.|0
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making his film. When he tries to stop, he ends up in the hospital with heart trouble and goes into cardiac arrest, and he wakes up on the table of a police station. His mother is arrested on a murder charge and the two are convicted in the murder of the woman he loved. In the process, his relationship with his parents and the people he loves are torn apart as his mother and father attempt to destroy him. The story was written by Richard Linklater.|0
"Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one that's ever been made in color, and the color is not a secondary theme in Ford 's career. It is the only one that's never been remade, and the color was never part of the original story . For the past 100+ years, every John Ford film is referred to as a ""lost"" film by the general public. Not only did Ford not write about it, the film never existed. Ford 's version was never completed, and never completed as a finished film."|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were so bad they were even dubbed into Chinese. You'd better believe that the Chinese were watching those movies and thinking of the Japanese, and that the Chinese were so impressed with the Japanese, they thought the Japanese must have come from the moon. But they weren't thinking that the Chinese thought they were the Japanese. The Chinese were trying to learn how to shoot a gun, and the Japanese tried to teach them how to fight.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch the trailer. I've been a fan for some time now and this trailer really puts me in the right mindset of what the film is going to be. It's the kind of film that you always want to see but never get around to doing it. I don't know if it was the trailer I saw this summer, I don't know if I've ever seen it before, but this film is something different.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when you are in Berlin, because the war is over in 1945, but there is one thing that can stay as a reminder of your time there. The train was called the Värmlättern (Varttern). The station building was built in the shape of a V, so when you leave you go up on the train. In the 1970s it was proposed to have a sculpture of this train, but this never materialised because the people who were going to do it did not want a sculpture.|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost'' ) is up to speed on some of the most pressing issues in modern technology, and that includes cell phone towers. His book, `` How to Hack a Cell Phone Tower: The Inside Story,'' provides a wealth of information that should make it easy for everyone in the field of cell phone systems engineering to understand. For example, it is clear from the book that every phone system design engineer will learn something from the information presented in this book that should be of interest.|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in many ways, the movie manages to deliver a nice little glimpse into Carpenter's life . At the beginning of the movie we see Karen Carpenter , a young girl , singing in a nightclub with her two girlfriends , her mother , and her brother . They are drunk and singing , and it is not long before they get into trouble . Karen's mother calls her to the phone and asks if she wants to go home .|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
"After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just like women. It was a groundbreaking show, not to mention a watershed moment in American feminism. If you're going to discuss gender in entertainment, you have to include this. This isn't the first time the term ""female villain"" is applied to an iconic character on television. However, I think it might be the first time an openly transgender character was created and used as a villain, much less one with a female face."|0
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 or 5 times since then, and although I've never had a problem with it. But, after seeing it once, after it has been in theaters and seen by some people. I can tell that something is different from the movie that I remember from my childhood (even though I'm in my early twenties. I think the movie was not that long ago). It's just like when the movie is so popular, but in a certain time.|0
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Caballero and others and you can just jump , you can hit your jump button and you can take the jumps and you can do many tricks . If you are into skating and you like to jump and you are not scared of hitting things then you should try it . I do think it is a good game , it has many tricks to perform and you can use them for the game . You can do it at any time of the day .|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into some more detail with the next spoiler I am going to save you from some of this stuff. This next spoiler is the first time I got to talk about the V.I.P . Now I can't show you the V.I.P . I can tell you that . I had to do this . So I have a couple of options that I can show you as well . I'll just tell you some of the first one that I got to do.|0
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and others, I don't think they'll be winning any Oscars tonight. I had a great time at the show and I really hope I got the chance to do the show as it would be a real shame that I would not be doing it for two years, but that's what it is all about. I'm sure they won't mind, though. It was a great opportunity for me and I am really happy to have had that opportunity.|0
"The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being summoned to a meeting at his production office: ""I've just been fired. I'm sorry to inform you, but I just can't do this anymore. I've spent the last year trying, and I'm tired of fighting. So I am leaving, with nothing but a note."" As the director, he makes it very clear that he's leaving before the meeting concludes. And as the audience sees it, his exit is not accompanied with any parting gifts or expressions of regret."|0
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . It's difficult to compare a western movie with the original western. A good western can be pretty good or very good depending on the director and writer. The western of the 50's was very good and very interesting. There is a lot to be said for movies like The Searchers and Tombstone

As for ""bad"" westerns, in my experience, the best of the worst are usually the best of the worst, like The Magnificent Seven and The Hired Man."|0
"There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Big Country . Not only has it received critical acclaim from critics , but it also holds the distinction of being one of the first films to make John Wayne an ""A"" rated character in a Western . This is a movie that needs to be seen, and one that is worth your time and money. Wagonmaster is the film that will open the doors that will open for you to see John Wayne in his best performances as he did the last time, in The Big Country ."|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy . I mean , who else does he have to be in the same building with?? That's just ridiculous!! I mean , that show is just so awesome and the people who work on it are awesome and the writers are awesome! There are so many great things about it, but it's just an amazing show that just has it all . I'm so proud to be a Williams fan and I hope all the people who like it love it too .|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's platform, if that's the case, the guy who draws this is a liar, and he is an idiot, because he does not understand the greatness of what this cartoon's about, he does not see this, because this guy is ignorant and he is ignorant because he can't be bothered to try and figure out all that is there in this cartoon. It takes a genius to draw the greatest cartoon ever, and even that is not what he is.|0
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the way they depicted the war with the rebels. I liked that the rebel troops were well organized but there was a sense of uncertainty about how to fight them and there were no clear lines. I like that the rebel leader wasn't just some buffoonish figure. A lot of times you can't tell much about the leader of a rebel group until you get some time in a battle and see it from all sides. That was great for this book.|0
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model I knew I wouldn't miss it. I was in my 20's but never thought I'd be tuning in as a teenage girl. It's been almost twenty years since I've seen it. I remember it being pretty funny and the girls always looked very pretty, but not to the level I thought a teen model would look like. It was like watching reality TV at that point in my life. I still remember the look on some of the girls faces.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The journey of The Cell begins with his confession on the night of February 6, 2016, when he broke into the apartment of a young woman. She and her mother died in his arms that night. When he was found out it was only by chance that the police discovered his identity. This journey will show the killer's past, present and future. As well as the many questions he has about his life.|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by her name. However, I am certain that Ms. Carpenter is an excellent writer of historical romances. It is not only that she writes such good ones. Karen Carpenter has also published two novels, the first, “Tales From The Lost Realm”, and “Ladies Of The Sea” have been highly successful, and are highly rated by both fans and critics alike. Carpenter has also written many other stories and novellas. She was very good at short stories.|0
"See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my Face kind of movie I guess I’m still a little shocked when I watch the movie . But I gotta say this movie looks pretty great

It’s a story that has the potential to go down in cinema history. Directed by John Woo, it stars Lee Young-ae in the leading role. Lee Young-ae is a talented actor, and she was recently seen in the TV series, “My Big Sister”, as one of the main casts."|0
"`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life situations and fictional characters that make for a great read, while still having a bit of fun. It takes a little time to get into, which is understandable, but if you read the whole thing it can be a really rewarding and fun experience. I give it 5 stars

The last day of the Easter holidays has arrived. Time has come again, time to return to school and do the long school holidays."|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone was in love with the song, so I could never make the song more than 10-12 minutes . But once we got to the final song, they all started crying . The final song was just incredible , and everyone had to stop , just to let everyone cry . Thats what a song is . If you listen to that song , then you will see why it is my favourite . But if I had to name a song , it wouldnt be a song like that .|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy. A movie that can't be enjoyed by children, who have to see it with the parents, must be a piece of fiction ..... It's not the time to make children see the real thing ... The movie is very nice, it's not as scary as I expected from this movie. But it has to be watched by children to get the real experience. That is, I was expecting more violence. I'm not surprised with any of this.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and tension throughout, and as the title suggests , it will keep you thinking. This film will make you want to rewind and go watch it again for the second and third times, and in a way, it has already done this to many others . If you are like me and don’t know how to respond to a certain type of movie or character, I’d suggest that you watch and think.|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I have seen it so many times that it is more like a retelling of some classic story. It is a movie about women in the early 20th century. There is not much in the way of modern technology involved in its production but the story is still very dramatic. I found it to be great if you want to learn about the early beginnings of the film industry and how it was started. There is a great story about how these women got started.|0
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, it is more difficult to discern the intent of the author - but it is possible to identify the author by reading this book and by the way that he/she chooses to speak about his/her own experience with such a very serious matter. This book is an attempt to answer this very serious question in the simplest way possible. If I was the perpetrator, what I want to know is this: who are you? Where do you come from? How did you get there?|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
"Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most controversial because he had the reputation of making the cartoons more vulgar, less realistic, and more explicit than he intended or wanted to be. It was said by one of his former artists, ""He was more interested in making cartoon than making people laugh."" In the mid-60s, he changed his ways by having less sex in his art, and then he made his first foray into children's book publishing by coining the word ""cute""."|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a girl from Wonderland who finds a friend (named Bob) who has the same problem as her, but can also become a very powerful wizard. She is going to tell her friends the wonderful secret about how her friend Bob found the secret way back to Wonderland, which leads to his own transformation to be a powerful wizard himself . But Alice also has the problem of her friend being a very powerful wizard himself.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . So we can be honest we can do the exact same thing . But we are going to get off topic . You can't change the weather , you can't change the moon . In the mean time it just pisses off a lot of people who think they are doing their country good . So this morning I was thinking about this . I had been reading about how there is an epidemic in the black community.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I'm thinking I will now go back to the movie . I always thought that I would never see her like this again . I think that it was really hard for me because it is very difficult to see yourself when you are in a position like that . And it was a very difficult time for me . I'm trying to recover . I'm still trying to recover . It was really hard . I was really in a tough position .|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and a terrific writer of comedy, but in this case you can't. This film is just a joke in the vein of ""The Producers""

It seems to me there is a very good reason why the public is not amused at this film - it's not even a comedy, it just makes fun of the absurdity of what a lot of people might call ""diversity"", and the way some of it is dressed up as art."|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking about it . But this is awesome. The way she talks and plays with the camera. I want one! The show I'm most interested in this week is Supernatural . I have a lot of trouble remembering what I want to see this week. I think I'll be a lot more interested in it than usual. I've been a big Supernatural fan since it was on in the late 90's and I watched every single season and every episode on TV.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist I do not own any music hall records but I did research a few for this project.

The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a very nice reaction from readers. From the use of music to a well written narrative. I think it would be a great gift for all of the teachers in my school who have very little interest in literature. I’ve not read this one yet, but it’s always a delight to receive a well written work. If you have read this book, what are some things that you liked most about the story and why?|0
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. I was surprised not to see it in any Best of... I agree with the reviews as they give the movie a 3/5 rating , the only reason i didnt give it a 2 was because i have seen it a few times before and dont think that it is any better or worse then most movies. The acting was excellent too. I think it would be a very good movie, but it has the same flaws as all other tv movies.|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying it. I bought it solely to see what it was going to be . The first thing I did was just open the box. The package came in a big square box . I unzipped it slowly , and I got my first look inside the box . Inside the box . I opened it up and got an amazing look inside of it . It was so cute , and had all the details I wanted about Just before Dawn . It included a manual with a lot of information .|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just amusing . It is a darkly humorous comedy that will make you laugh, if you laugh at it , it will make you cry. And as is the case with most of the films to come out in recent years , it also has a good message that will make a good impact. But there is something really special about this movie that makes me think this is not going to be a standard comedy , but one that has a serious message that needs to be discussed.|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in his life. As soon as he lands in California, he’s forced to face his demons and work through his past as he learns to trust himself and others again. Jim was once an elite pilot and the best in his age group. But for reasons unknown, he can’t fly. Jim is now in a wheelchair. He can’t use his legs properly and is confined to an airtight room.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic, vibrant production with a high energy. I like to take the time to watch a show that is really well done. But I was curious about this new production that is coming up on April 24th with a new director. And as I said, this production was great from the very first moment, so I thought I should mention it. This production will feature some of the most beautiful sets ever. I have to give it credit. I mean this production is really spectacular.|0
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a character . He is believable as the guy who is trying to make it in life and he is convincing as the character . I have always liked Morris chestnut . His performances in the movie is excellent . My first thought when watching this film is that we all should see this film . But the more I watch this film , the less I like it . The acting is just fine , it is well acted , and the screenplay is great .|0
"Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice and can vouch for how bad the movie is . My wife and I were watching the movie and my wife commented that it seemed very dark , dark , dark . I didn't understand the comment at the time so I said , "" it's just like the movies we've seen on TV and movies we've seen on video "" . I think my wife is wrong . It's not dark . I think it was dark at the beginning , then it was light ."|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own. There have been films I’ve liked more than others, I have liked them more often than I would like, but I haven’t liked them all. I do like them though, even the ones I don’t especially. I like them in the sense that they have a kind of beauty to them which is so very rare in Hollywood that even the ones that don’t really have a kind of beauty to them are often the best ones I’ve seen.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how a woman who is being treated in a psych ward will end up with her own family. It's so well done, but it's more about the protagonist than it is about the antagonist, and the film is not very good. I give it only 2/5 , maybe a little too long and a little too slow in parts. I can understand the reason for this rating but I don't think it is good enough.|0
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of all , i was expecting the story to be in the style of an action flick but that didn't happen . The action was great but they did not show enough gore . The story was pretty predictable but there was no fight that i wanted to see ... the movie was too predictable and too predictable . Even the trailer was predictable . All in all i am disappointed by the movie . The action scenes were good but the gore scene was the worst i ever saw in my life .|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America for that matter. In it, a young girl named Alice (Julie Andrews) is visiting New York city with her father on vacation and is struck with the strangeness of all the skyscrapers that surround her. She then goes down to the city streets to try to find an explanation for this strange phenomena. She is joined by her friend Mary (Sigourney Weaver). Together they try to figure out what is going on. Alice gets stuck in the high-rise skyscraper and it falls into the street.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little by posting this. I do so for two good reasons: 1) I’m interested in watching a couple of episodes to see if I would change my mind about the series (and if I would be interested in reading the book as well as watching it), 2) I also want to see how others react to it. As always, thank you to all who have taken the time to leave comments.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. This was a story about an alien that had landed on this planet. He wanted to be a good host. The story goes that his mother had died from the same disease, but the aliens don't know why she did it and that he was sent here to find her. I was looking forward to this movie as I thought this might be an interesting story. And I thought it might be very interesting to see someone that is an alien land on our planet.|0
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! they are so cute i couldnt stand it at all !!! and the little girl is adorable !! ! ! . i will buy the movie as long as i have to buy the movie with my own money ! ! ! they are all wonderful !! ! Hi i saw your review of the movie and i agree that it's very cute and cute ! ive seen a lot of movies but never a cute one ! ! i saw this movie and it is very cute !|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death . The film 's an interesting watch and one I will probably watch over and over again . You 're a good boy . You know . I 've always liked you . You know . It was a good day to you . You knew what I was . You knew what I 'd been .. I 'm glad you got what you want . I was proud of you . I was a very proud father .. You 're a great kid . You 've always done well .|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross. I have seen many a movie about gangs and I know how they operate, it’s not an issue. For a start they get together every Wednesday night. They meet at a club in the basement and watch some movies. They drink a bit more than most and then they go back to the clubs. They meet every Saturday afternoon. It’s basically a night out where they can drink a little bit more than most and have some fun.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series of the 21st century . I have always been a big fan of Noah’s Ark . This series is the perfect example of what can be done . I would recommend it to everyone , not just naturalists. The story line of the story takes you to the very beginning of the world . When a group of explorers arrive on the planet to try and make a fortune they find a colony of the dinosaurs living in harmony , and not in war !|0
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to entertain me. The best sitcoms I have had in the past have been those from The Golden Girls, Friends, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Seinfeld. Of those I have had the fewest episodes in the past which I will admit was for a reason. My favorite of the ones I have watched is Friends , which I think had a good concept and it made you feel like you had really connected with the characters but it is a little annoying.|0
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex, drugs , crime , corruption , violence and sex . In my opinion , they are nothing like what americans are usually used to seeing in western films , and to me that is part of what makes them so entertaining . They have their own way of presenting the events , but at the end of the day , the only thing they are really looking for , is to get into the minds of those who are watching , and give the audience something that will keep them entertained .|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more than any other I've ever seen , so it will have to do . I'm a little confused at the time period for the last part . I have to disagree. I don't have to disagree, but I find the ending of this movie kind of confusing. I know that this is an animated movie, but it still has to go back to when it originally came out as an animated film, so I guess it's kinda confusing.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years. The painting itself was stolen from an antique dealer in the city of Modena . It is believed to be the same thief who stole a copy of the Mona Lisa .The painting is estimated to be worth between 3.5 and 5.5million dollars. The Mona Lisa was stolen sometime between 6 and 9 years ago .There is some question about whether it is a copy of a similar Mona Lisa , but the original is believed to have been sold at a good price by an antique dealer in Modena.|0
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . I like the term because it seems more natural. There is something comforting about being Blue, although it can be difficult to know if your Blue is more aware, less aware, or less comfortable. The term also makes the idea of being Blue a bit more clear and specific, as opposed to general. I like the term, because it seems more natural . As I've described above, Blue might be more aware, or less aware, or less comfortable.|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply stunning. It is not the type of concert I normally go to, but I had to attend in order to see it live. This is not a bad concert for any concert but I can't help but think how lucky we are to get this concert. I am sure it is a once in a lifetime chance for this to happen again. The band is incredible. Their music is amazing and they have such a nice stage show with all the lights, lights, lights and lights.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Both are based on books and movies that have a lot to say, but are also very dark and gritty in places . I'm going to start on a more violent movie list first , and hopefully that'll give me a better idea of what type of films I would enjoy . I have to confess , the only movies I've seen that I think were good enough to recommend to you are those I've already listed on the previous pages . I'll just say .|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford wanted to make from the start - he didn´t want to go the way of most directors. As he said when talking to the press on the release, ""This is an opportunity to see what I like doing best."" But he wanted to make the film for the fans, not the commercial. The commercial aspect will of course make it bigger and better than ever, but the idea is the same."|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. In its second viewing, the story is well-told but not very interesting. The movie has several interesting twists to it, so it is worth rewatching to get the story straight. The Cell is not as bad as the first movie, even though it is really bad. It doesn’t hold up well as a movie in general. The Cell ( 2000 ) Rating : 7/10It is not really a bad movie. It is just a bad movie, so watch it again.|0
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen – and it is still baffling when you start to see it at a second-hand bookshop. The story is very simple – a man gets into a car, gets hit by a drunk driver and dies from the injuries. It then follows the story of a man who finds this story is true. A woman comes along, and decides to be the narrator of this story, and we follow her for the next six weeks. It is set in the mid-1980s, but it has no time or place.|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife ( Liev Schreiber ), and estranged daughter ( Jurnee Smollett-Bell ) who has come to love him despite the hardships. Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) was the most controversial and acclaimed movie of the 2000s for its controversial depictions of African-Americans in America. He starred as a young black man at the turn of the 21st century, forced to live a life of constant self-denial in a small town. He was also nominated for an Oscar.|0
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing at the time, other than what I had learned from books. I had no knowledge of sex and I really didn't care to know . . . yet . . . so . . . this movie was the beginning and the middle of a new kind of movie which I was to look forward to for years to come. This is the way my life would change forever if it had not come about. I grew up with the desire to know and know everything.|0
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I 've a good friend there and I'm sure that he will do all he can to help you with what your going through! You have a lovely family and you seem to be very caring and supportive of each other. I would just ask you to please do what you can to be there for each other and make sure your loved ones are ok. As for your husband , he sounds like a good person and it sounds like you two are doing well so don't be too upset.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of art house cinema for over a decade. His work has become one of the most well-documented and celebrated in history, thanks to his tireless work in the field of visual anthropology. He’s worked with many of the world’s leading film directors in his career, and has collaborated with many of the finest filmmakers of our time – including Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, and Quentin Tarantino – as well as the late Roger Corman.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as well. We were the first people who saw it back in the summer. We were the only ones to see it at the theater. My aunt and I were both in love with the movie. She didn't want to leave till the last scene. This is the one movie which made me change my entire opinion on her. I was very excited to see the film again. We saw it about 6 weeks after we had left home, after we had gotten home.|0
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest. This isn't so, as each film's story is told from the protagonist's perspective. This film is quite clever and interesting, with a solid, well-acted cast to back it up. It is the first of the three films in the series, and thus the first to offer an explanation and context as to why the series exists in the first place. It also makes sense that the film would be a direct continuation of a previous one, as this film begins in '80.|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe I will tell them what she is like when I know that she is not going to be around when the time is right to tell them. __________________If I had to choose I would rather live like a mouse or a cat. The only difference is that the mouse won't make the noise that the cat is making. The thing is, Fata had been working on a new album when I saw her on stage earlier this week.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about this movie. The only way to describe the whole film, is if I was at the airport and someone asked me what movie they wanted to go see, I wouldn't choose any other film. I wouldn't even choose a comedy movie, that's too bad. So it's a film I can go and see alone and not be bothered by all those people trying to tell me how great the movie is... I mean really.|0
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
"The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for a slew of popular childrens' movies, as well as a number of TV shows. But the Kettles were not the only children in the series. Here's a little something that might just be worth your time if you see it:

There are 3 versions of the Kettle characters in the series:

A family of five. The father, Mrs. Kettle. The young Kettle's mother. A very, very young Kettle. Whoa. Oh, my goodness."|0
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I mean really, the film does not have a lot to say. But the story of how it all began to take place I think people just have a lot of trouble with. But I believe the reason people find it so difficult to understand is because there were so many things I did not like in it, so many times. But there's nothing I really can say I didn't like about it except that I'm glad I saw it.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  there is an important part where it becomes an important story . The story of the film seems to have a simple beginning and ending , which makes me believe that the story is a very simple story . But this story is very complicated , and it is not easy to understand it . In my opinion , the story is a very simple story , but is very complex and hard to understand . But this story is a very simple story and is not so difficult .|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White people , you will find the White people on Black people. The Black guy on White people . I am sorry for the Black people , but the White people do not have their own culture . I like the Black people . The white man has the culture , they have the country . Black culture does not have a country . Black culture did not have a country . Black people are the country. I am not saying that we have a country .|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I thought it might be worth a look . If you get the chance to see the films I’d love to hear your thoughts and opinions . I’m especially interested in your reaction to how much of the music was actually composed by the composers. ”I’m interested in hearing how much of the actual music actually originated with the composers. For instance, I’m not familiar with any of them, so how much music did they use to create their scores?|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than it could have been, but I think it really is a lot of fun. It has a great art style, which is something I find really cool in games, and is really unique to this series. It’s also, from what I’ve played it, a pretty big game, and I would say that I’m probably not the only one to enjoy it. If you like the horror genre, you may like it too.|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is that every episode I see is a little bit different than the one I watched before. I think it’s because they were trying to find a way to create a totally different show. Gilmore Girls is like a little girl who can’t stop talking. I think it was the best thing ever when they broke it up. I feel like I have the Gilmore Girls show memorized. I watch it so I can re-watch Gilmore Girls for my own amusement.|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . The movie was a very entertaining experience and a real treat to those who had never seen such an intimate film such as this one. I'm glad the director was able to do what he has done so well and I look forward to see more from his works in future. The cinematography of the film was excellent and the actors who appeared in this film did a great job. I highly recommend that you see it! 1. What was your first introduction to your art and/or career?|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks. I don't know if it will do that, but it was a nice movie to see. I was very disappointed with that one , and I was a little disappointed with another Hawks flick, ""A Little Respect"" , which was also directed by Barthema, but had much better special effects. The first one looked very good, but the last one had some really weird looking effects in the end ."|0
"I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a new perspective to this movie and made everyone think , why are they doing the same thing , when they are not good at it

This is an amazing movie , It's not a romance like some other movies , which is not good at all , I think this movie would be good at the boxoffice if its a sequel , but the story is so good and the performances are all good . This film is so awesome , I would recommend it to everybody !"|0
"Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission that turns him into an unstoppable force, he must risk his life for his own survival.”

I don’t want to give anything away but this book has an awesome cover, nice writing and a good story. I haven’t given it a lot of time so it might have a few flaws but it definitely has some really great ideas and that is always good.”

“For fans of fantasy and mystery novels, we have no doubt this is the book to buy."|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at all sympathetic . I have heard of a few films with that name . But this one has too many holes for that to be the case . The characters are too much alike . The plot is too cliched . The dialogue too crude . In fact, it's like it's lifted from some other movie that I've never seen . In fact, it's not even like a movie that I've seen . I just don't like it . The story is so cliche .|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand it looks to be set in Australia and the country is mentioned, yet its main focus appears to be Britain. On the face of it, it looks as though it's about a detective working for the police investigating a crime of the first water - a bank robber. It's a bit hard to take too seriously, but with all that it's based around, it looks as though you're in for a very, very strange viewing experience.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to a woman in love with herself , I thought I would never forget the film . I loved this film and wish I could have the opportunity to make a movie of it one day . What a beautiful world that must be. I was talking with a bunch of women about their favorite films , and I realized I have not seen one of these films. I am in a similar boat, and I thought about making a list and sharing it here.|0
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the entire genre. I think that it would be a mistake not to pick it up at some point when you come across the work of Peter Dalle. A lot of people don’t think that the film is funny, but you really have to pay attention to how Dalle uses his actors as well as his sound effects as well as everything else that he does to make sure it works and be able to see the comedy in the work.|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces and I'm delighted we got to see it again. This is one of John Ford's classics. I'll be looking for the other two of his westerns in the next few days, for sure! This is the last of the westerns directed by John Ford, which is to say there are not a great many. In fact, only three of these have made the big time and I have three others on the horizon.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's a member of the same union , from Washington, D.C., to Mexico. They are being trailed in a car along a dirt road. All of a sudden they hear this loud explosion. They get up and see a bunch of dead bodies in the road , and a body on the hood of a car. They run. A firefight ensues, during which the soldiers get killed. The money, and the banker, get stolen.|0
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in American history. It also gives a great view of our country in general. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves movies and love the story of their country and the American people. The movie is great! It gives me the feel of a real country and this movie just made it better! This was a great movie! I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anybody! What a fantastic film. Not just a movie, but a wonderful documentary.|0
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (which I'm sure he'd have liked if he'd lived to see this century), was when he and my mother stopped talking to me during the first three months of high school and went on to live together for a decade. My parents married for love, and the end of their friendship is a good time to remember that. I wish I had the same thing my father did. My mother and I were friends for years.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time, and the rest of it is garbage, and that's just the first three seasons. It's a joke. I've never seen an American Idol and I'm certainly not rooting for anyone to go out on a limb and say that they won't like the way it is with American Idol. I will say that it is not for the faint of heart. But if you want to go down that rabbit hole, just go.|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) . It is quite difficult to choose one of the best movies to watch in our list of best English films . But if I had to choose I will go for it . It is also a great romantic story and a great film in itself. The plot of the story involves the young couple , who are looking for a suitable and a good match for a daughter and her husband . During the first half of the film , we see that they are living happily and are enjoying their home .|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that I am forced to watch one here. I am not saying that it is bad to see it, just that I always like to watch movies from a different angle, and also not to compare. The only exception is The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This movie, as you can easily tell by the title and plot, does not feature any sexy, beautiful women, which I find quite annoying.|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known writer/journalist.I thought that the story was plausible enough and had some real characters, but I felt that there were some flaws that would need to be addressed.Some of these problems came to my attention when I read it again.I have to say that after reading '' The Egyptian '' I still felt that the story was believable and had some interesting characters, but the writing style was very amateurish, with a lot of errors in writing.|0
"when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 2010's. I thought, 'Is this truly a controversial topic?' and 'Is it even worth talking about?' Well, I think it is, and you definitely need to know it before you watch, so here it goes! First of all, yes, there are a lot of people that disagree with the ending. It's not so much that I'm against it, but what I was really talking about is all of the people who were like ""What the F**k?"""|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the narrative pace. The book takes place a few months after the events of Leviathan Wakes. The King of the Underworld (the name is used in some places to denote the main character, who is not known to the reader ) is an orphaned boy brought up by his grandmother, but who finds he has special abilities that he can use to make his life better in some ways, but make it harder, if not more dangerous, in others.|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have the same feeling , as a lot of people in here have the same feeling , that if the series had gone a bit deeper , that it’s probably going to go the same way. But it doesn’t, the series is great , and its a great series , but I am a bit sad at the notion that it was not as good as I hoped for it, or I’m sorry to say that .|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died last year and I feel very sad about it, because she was so special and I’m gonna miss her so much , even today . And she will be missed, and I want to thank you , because you make me happy . I am going to cry for her now . I hope she is with her angelic soul , and now I’m sure I’ll see her again someday . Thank you for making me a better person , and I wish I could have known you .|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a barge. I'm kind of not fond of the idea, either. I mean, if it were an old lady it would probably look pretty awful. It's kind of creepy. It's also not just the look that is disturbing. The way it's positioned on the poster makes it even more creepy. And then there's the fact that I don't even really know what it is. I don't know whether it's a cartoon, a poster, or some other medium.|0
"Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The White Rabbit '

I am trying to figure out if it is a joke or if you have actually heard of this guy. Can you explain what the white rabbit is, or where I might find out more about him? Click to expand... I have to be honest and say the rabbit has been a source of humor for me since we were kids. I have tried to make it fun to go to the rabbit's garden and find a white rabbit in a pot or the rabbit's house."|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just look on the internet you will find that its one of the most downloaded shows on tv in the history of tv shows . If you know the actors on this show I would highly recommend watching all of them. All of them have amazing accents, all are funny , none of them suck as the lead actors . They are very British and very funny . The reason the show was made into such a big deal is because all of the actors were so good that they had to play the leads.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and her character is Perfectly portrayed . The music is the perfect accompaniment to this wonderful story . Robin Hood is a Great Character , and she will be missed by so many. The acting of all the characters is well conceived and well acted . It was a wonderful movie . I liked this film a lot! It was a good movie. I enjoyed all the characters. Robin Hood was perfect in the role. She was so beautiful and powerful. It was a very great movie.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football season. He ends up losing the game, but his attitude is still a big part of it. That attitude gets him in the state tournament. After his team wins it all, the state champion team takes the game in overtime, where they are upset by another team. The losing team gets their revenge by knocking the other team to 0-0, which is the same team that beat him in the state championship game, and the coach calls it a tie.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it a lot (I was not expecting it). I was curious to know how it would turn out. But, it seems that it’s not really funny. But, we will see what happens.But it is worth to watch it for that.I’d say watch it because it makes you laugh. The humor is quite good I must say. But, I won’t rate it for it because the plot was quite confusing.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, I thought it would be inappropriate to be so harsh. But I guess I should have been a little gentler in my reaction to his comments. It has been a month since my son has been admitted to a mental hospital. We have not been able to contact him. And I cannot begin to imagine what he must be going through. He has spent a majority of his time in and out of hospitals as his symptoms have worsened.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during some time. It's not that great but it's funny . There's also some good things in it as well , I just need to go through the first couple. It's great that they've got so many talented people , I wish they had so much talent . I've read the book before but haven't read the comic yet . It's really great and it should be on my top 4 list .|0
"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time with this show. There is not one single reason I will watch this show, but then again I don't watch that many shows, and they're just not my cup of tea. This show, though, has made me question if I can ever watch something again that is not on my ""bucket"" list, or if I will ever watch a show I can't watch because it's just not something I can enjoy it."|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have watched the video and really enjoyed it. Thank you for sharing. I'm also looking forward to reading your thoughts on it! If I can't find a copy, can anyone recommend where I could watch it on DVD? Or, do you think I should buy it? Thanks so much for your time and attention to my questions! I will be looking for a copy in a couple of days, so hopefully you'll have one sooner rather than later.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) directed but also the greatest movie ever made, period. But this is where we get to the problem: I have never been so confused about two things at once! I have watched the movie four times now and each of them are different in quality and so I want to say the same thing over and again... The movie is just the most incredible thing I have seen in a while. I am speechless. I don't remember ever getting so lost in a movie.|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't give us any real story , and it doesn't have any real characters . Posse has a very good cast , and i like most of them . They are not perfect , but they do n't need to be. I really enjoyed the movie . It is a good action packed drama , with a good story line . The story is very well written . The actors do their job well , and they have great chemistry .|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and deserves all the praise there is. I've been watching it for about two weeks, and I can say without hesitation that it is one of the finest documentaries that I have ever seen or heard. It truly is the best documentary I have seen on the internet, and will be the first to be added to the list of all of the finest documentaries I have ever watched. You will find very few documentaries that will make you cry out in pain the way this piece of work does.|0
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some time ago, and their minds were turned to a new medium , film. Film is, in fact, a medium. It is a tool to convey ideas, entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire the viewer. Film directors use it as a visual medium to convey their ideas and messages in a visually appealing way. For many years, films have been the only means to convey ideas and messages, as it is a more engaging medium for them.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd find in the wild, something to get you hooked. Personally I don't care what anyone else says, or thinks. I have seen the video, I have looked at the film and I think it's all true. And, as someone stated, it works for me, not you, I don't care if you think it's bad. You don't have to agree with me either. I really don't like the video as it is, I prefer the version in the book.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty White was fantastic as she played a character that she made famous in her younger days. I really think that this will be a movie that you watch just to see what kind of characters Betty White has been through in her time. If you are in the mood for something that is a little more serious than your average romance it should be great fun . I would recommend watching this film on DVD with your family as a family movie night.|0
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a bad movie. I can't think of any other films where you could see this movie as a whole and not see some of the elements that were bad about it at the same time. I will not spoil anything, but let's take a look at some of the problems I have with this film. Let's begin with the bad acting and dialogue. It is a little disconcerting that every character has the exact same voice.|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , I know that may not be true) so that's all I can ask for. This is one I can be proud of. You have a beautiful family here. The pictures are really beautiful, the kids are cute, the dogs are adorable, the flowers are lovely, the home is amazing, the dog is just the perfect size. There are so many cool things about this house and you are a fantastic person for sharing it! I love it!|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to action to drama . I don't think it did it all . It didn't have the best voice casting but I have to take a look at what they did cast well . That was more of my complaint than the actual acting . I thought all of the characters were too similar . I thought the one that I liked had a great voice . The rest . I didn't care . I was so bored . There was so much action .|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , the slasher subgenre would reach the height of its popularity and influence that it did. But its roots go back much further, to the early horror films of the late 19th century, when the term "" slasher 's '' originated. The first slasher film of this ilk appeared in 1909 . The first slasher film was actually made in the early 1920's , however, and there were several others that followed in subsequent years."|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this band is exceptional. They are all excellent players and have all the skills necessary to perform at this level. They also play their instruments very well. It is a real honour to have them perform for a band like this, because they have a lot to give to the music. The whole set is so well performed it seems as if the band is just sitting there in a studio listening and waiting for the audience to enjoy what they have created.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning in 1999. The movie `` Mithi/ Mithali '' was in search for for all of us. All of us are here to watch the new movie, the movie has been made. We have no problems in finding it. We are here to watch the movie from the best place in the world, it is the park Avenue. Park Avenue provides a beautiful view of our world. We do not need to worry about what we can eat and what kind of clothes are acceptable in the movie.|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
"i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen it 3 times ... this show is the only show that will never get boring ! and i will always keep watching it .. it is the only show i will love to watch ! The show was good. It is very good. I'm glad you like it. I don't really like those ""bad"" ones. But I love this one. There are good things in it, and they are so much better than what is out there."|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as they all try to juggle work, home and romance. One of the biggest stories in British film history, and still one that is talked about today, was the rise and fall of Diana Rigg. Faced with what many in the media have described as the most famous soap opera of the past 25 years, it is fair to say that many people have written her off as one of the most overrated actors on television.|0
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an ordinary drama. The story of an ordinary family who move into their local pub and try and make it a good place to live. The barman's wife is the main character with her own life which is not always very pleasant. There is the odd bad guy thrown in but you know the good guys are going to be there every night. My favourite part of this drama is that the barman's wife looks like a lovely woman but when she dies in the final episode it is a complete tragedy.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I thought this was a really good idea and I'm glad I was right. The movie looks really good, it's funny, and I think everyone should watch this. I'd like to add that the movie was pretty funny and the trailer had this really cool and clever idea of making a cartoon. So, I went into the theatre today and it was worth the trip! The movie looks great, it's funny, and I think anyone should see this.|0
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I saw it , I was shocked to learn what was in the film . I didn't think there was going to be anything in it . The opening montage in the beginning made me think there was something there , then I thought it would be a movie , but it wasn't . It was too much like a movie . I wasn't surprised that they made it , but it's hard to not be disappointed .|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of Australian criminal gangs and the people who try and stop them . The plot focuses on John , his girlfriend Mandy and their friends . The first half follows a story that John has been planning for years . When he receives an urgent phone call asking him and his friends to accompany a young woman who has been kidnapped and robbed . John , Mandy and the others decide to go to her home to rescue the woman from a dangerous gang that has kidnapped and robbed them .|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a child , torture of an animal , torture of a living being etc.. you go to the internet to find them. You can go to all sorts of porn sites, but there is a new website in the market which you should be aware of. These are the best websites to visit for porno. You will never have the chance to meet these people, but the fact is, there are plenty of them.|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical feature version, and not the DVD with the deleted scenes. I'm quite happy with the original theatrical release, as far as the film was concerned and I think the original theatrical DVD is a better release, especially given that the original theatrical release is on DVD. I do wonder though as to what the DVD version does with the extra scenes, but as I said, I will review it myself and give an opinion on it when I receive the DVD from the studio.|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""The Golden Age of Crime"". One of the best examples of this kind of story, written by the American writer Theodore Sturgeon and published between 1926 and 1928 in the New York Times Magazine, involved a young man named Tom Riddle and a crime syndicate operating in New York and Chicago. The story takes place in the early 1930s and involves Tom, a college student who goes to work for the same syndicate but in a more respectable capacity."|0
America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i think it is a waste of time , and for some , they are so lazy that they dont know what the hell is even going on with them . I know there are so many of them in the business that its hard to find the right girl , but i think the girl that is better than the next , and i guess it is her personality that helps her stand out , so i think that is one of the best things about being in the beauty business .|0
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably slipped a bit further down the charts than the others. This is not the first time it has happened, as this film, despite the name, has been a fairly low-budget film compared to most of the Republic pictures. However, it has also managed to sneak away from the rest of the titles, despite the fact that this is technically a Republic Production. The basic story is that some of the band is trying to get something together to play a club in London.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
"Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time . Great job . Good choice of the movie ! Anonymous (5/5)

""I had a great time with Elton. It's one of those films that made a great impression on me and still does today. He was really good, really funny and had an incredible voice. He makes me laugh when he speaks. He's a true talent that deserves more respect in the film world. He was a great choice and I'm looking forward to seeing him in more films down the line."|0
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series, but I have always been intrigued by the characters in these books. They are unique, and so very different from our own, but it all makes sense when you read about their lives. And then there are the ones that I have met who are completely different from me. So here are my thoughts on this week's books and how I'm currently enjoying them! 1) How I Met Your Mother (Spencer) - I did not love this book.|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's `` most famous story. This is the first time Osborne plays a leading role in Wilde's drama, although he has been involved in other adaptations and adaptations of Wilde's work. The adaptation is in the style of Oscar Wilde's later works, and it is a joy to see a director who knew Wilde so well. Osborne also gives a fittingly British turn to one of Wilde 's dark and tragic themes.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends Fromt he Last Boy Scout to play an older version of his protagonist, a man in his 60s who has spent his entire life trying to get a girlfriend, and is finally able to get it. The man's story begins when he meets a woman in his apartment building. He takes her for a ride on the subway, and he tells his parents he is married. His mother tells him that she is worried about him getting divorced, so he tells her to do what she thinks is right.|0

Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much but I don't regret it) . But I really wanted to make a very light film. I also wanted to add a bit of humor to it. I wanted the film to have a touch of absurdity, so I decided to make the film more or less as realistic as possible. I also wanted to make the movie very dark because it's hard to find light comedy films these days. But the end result is really cool to see, and it's fun to watch in a theater.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is very clear. It is about the Australian film and TV industry in the 1970s, at the dawn of television, the introduction of satellite and cable TV and what happened to that industry in the 1970s and 1980s with the rise in film production, the development of new markets and a new culture of television production. It shows the impact of television, especially the growth of film production in Australia, and it shows how the new Australian industry grew and the impact of the Australian cinema on Australian culture.|0
"I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute movie that makes me laugh . The characters are adorable. I would recommend it. I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg . This movie is absolutely perfect. You don’t need me to tell you that it is absolutely perfect. I just can’t wait for it to come out in my country. It is not going to get any closer. - - - Updated - - -

This review is from a movie review site

I will always recommend you to go and watch this movie."|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the public has applied to be allowed to go back to his native Kenya. He is a Kenyan national living in London with his mother and an aunt. He was born in Kenya .The application is being scrutinised by the London Police and is a matter of public concern. It has been suggested that this man should be refused a police permit to be in the UK. A letter has been sent to him demanding he return to Kenya.|0
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in a rural village in Africa it is shown how the African villagers are trying to make the best out of life, while dealing with the everyday worries of survival. It’s really a heart-rending movie as it explores the challenges of survival while the characters deal with their problems and the everyday tasks they have to perform to make the best out of life. I really enjoyed my time in this movie as I enjoyed seeing how life has been lived, while being faced with various obstacles in order to survive.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement in the West of the Book of Mormon. In this scene from the movie “Mormon”, it is clear that these two men and their companion were not only Mormon but also members of an American Indian tribe. The scene is shot in the springtime, in the mountains of the Far North of the United States. It is not clear from the image if the two men and their companion are members of the Anasazi tribe, but the scene could easily be taken as a member of the same Indian tribe.|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time , you'll not only get all that you deserve, but you'll even get a glimpse of a few scenes where you could possibly enjoy some Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary too . You don't have to worry about that . It's not just about Jane Austen . There's plenty of other stuff you can appreciate in this movie too . After all , isn't that the point of such films ?|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the same scene and thought how can I be so insensitive and insensitive. I understand what they mean. That is why I am writing in this post. So what was it that makes you say this? I have never read the book and so i don’t know if i could understand their perspective. I have to say that I can understand your opinion. That is why I decided to write this article. I know what some people are like.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . In particular, I had great hopes for their first album. But it never quite panned out. Instead, I was disappointed. But the album is far from the only disappointment that I had with the Carpenters. The band was great in their heyday, as well as the band in its early days (which I will be addressing later). So, let me tell you why I, and I think many people who really should know better, didn’t like The Carpenters.|0
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I have been wondering and I have to say I'm wondering if I can ask for help with my problem. I was going along the line that it could be for the best that it had to be. The last time I was with my family was Christmas and the time before that we had some family and friends over at the house and I was in my room. My son and my daughter came up and we all sat around and had some Christmas dinner.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for me, my favourite things include all kinds of books, great food, wine, fine music and beautiful people, I also have a particular fondness for fine art. As for all the things I like, it is wine. When I get to the bottom of the bottle of wine, I am drawn to things that I really want to experience. This is what has always led me to get to know all the great people who I admire and have a strong connection with.|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the summer. So I decided I had to watch it , but I only had 1 week left for my vacation. On the day I decided to watch it , I decided I would go out and see the movie. I saw the trailer and decided that I had to see it because I knew I was in for a lot of drama and a great movie. I also decided I would watch the movie in it’s entirety and not in any kind of review.|0
"If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the truth. 16 is a lie. 17 you are lying when you say i want to live with you because i love you, 17 is not a lie because if you say it i will die of a heart attack

I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress . She is an excellent actress who has made a very great career for herself. She also is well-known for her romantic dramas and romantic comedies , which she also directed. This is the movie where Amy Jo Johnson plays the leading role of Susie Q and her husband John Ritter plays the leading role of her boyfriend/fiance, John Doe. The movie is a romantic drama. This is the movie where Amy Jo plays the leading role .|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
"I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 or 10 . I found it very interesting and thought it would be interesting for you. I thought I would let it sit and have your thoughts and opinions and maybe even post a review to see how others think. I hope I did not offend anyone. Thanks for checking out this book. If you're interested, here are some more places you might want to read:

I just want to say that this book has been an absolute favorite of mine for a while."|0
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me. I 'm interested in making my own films . I have made a few short films in my life and they were a big learning curve.I 'll be doing shorts for a number of years and I 'm looking for directors that are interested in taking my shorts to a new level . Let's see how we go together. If you're also interested in doing shorts please get in touch. I'll give you details when I know it.|0
"My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually very good ! I am going to add this as my 4th favorite of the year. I also loved:
I liked it , but I didnt like a lot of the other movies
It was ok, but I didnt love
It was very good
I thought it was very interesting ! Overall I would say that it is a very good movie. Like it , but not as great as the previous one
I didnt really love this one !"|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a big comedy fan in high school, but after growing up watching ""The Blues Brothers"" and seeing the movies ""The Blues Brothers II"" and ""The Blues Brothers III"", this movie was so funny, I had to see it ! ******************
My rating : 10/ 10

I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
"Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, I really enjoyed it for its unique atmosphere, unique feel and unique art. The music was great as well. So if you like it, check it out. It was pretty special. :D

This is the second movie I've seen, and I am still waiting to see the last one. __________________

I like to watch movies, read books, listen to music. It's my life! The only reason I don't see this is because of the soundtrack."|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie and the gang at school. She's got the hots for her friends, and they all think she's great. She likes to act and look tough, and the other kids think she's really hot. She's also the slutty type, always getting into trouble. She has lots of friends who like her because of her sexiness and bad behavior. Her friends get a little worried when she doesn't come right away, but they don't mind because she's such a good little slut.|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Sudan. If you don't believe me just try it yourself. But here are some of the key facts you might not know (or perhaps you will, depending on the state of your memory). The movie opens in South Sudan, where the new government has been formed. It is the fourth government since the current one was formed in July 2005, but there are rumors that the fourth government is dead.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , charming , and it also had one of the funniest casts I have ever seen. The film is actually the third of three in the 's trilogy and I actually really enjoy them all equally . This is probably because of all the great writing in 's first two films , as well as being one of the funniest films that has been released since . So that's why I thought that I might give this a little bit of love .|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis to say what it wants to communicate. And if it's not necessary for an introduction it's not a good way to learn. It's just a nice little story to get you to take an interest. You can't tell me there aren't some things that just make sense. The tale starts out like a fairy tale. Cat gets lost and meets the Moon, who brings her a kitten to keep. Then she becomes interested in him and asks for his name, but he just says Moon.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I’ve been getting are from the perspective of people who never heard of him. And I’m guilty too. I’ve always known that he was kind of weird and interesting, but I hadn’t ever seen him play or even seen his stuff, much less seen his movies. So here I’m giving my take on him and his movies that you may not have heard about. (For the record, I love him and his movies.)|0
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we could have watched it for 1 hour in a row . it was fun to sit and watch it . we thought that it had too much of a plot . it has not a lot of interesting things to it . I was really disappointed in the way the story line was set up . it would not have taken much to fill in the blanks . it did not fill in the plot . and it did not provide us with any plot twists .|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational). So much that i couldn't resist re-watching the trailer as it was. And I couldn't believe it, the trailer to this movie was just too perfect. I couldn't believe there was so much wrong with this movie. I guess it's because I love the chains, but i think this movie makes it a much more enjoyable ride than the chains made it to be and i also think it's for adults only.|0
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Highness ; The Adventures of Robin Hood: Men of Archers, etc .) has made a daring, bold film about a woman's fight to survive in a male-dominated world. But it is not about a sex worker or a prostitute -- it is about a young man who, in the midst of a bitter divorce, finds his way back to the woman he loves and discovers that, despite his best efforts, his life as a sex worker has not changed at all.|0
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a disaster. I wasn’t expecting the first half of the show to be that good, but I’m happy to report that was the case. Even better is that, even though it took longer to get through the first half, I ended up finishing the show within the first three minutes of our second half. It’s a testament to how much of an audience you have to have to know the material well.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of the director, I have now watched the movie and I must admit I do not think I wasted it. I think the film is very good . And I think most of us would agree . The movie had a lot of twists and turns which I liked . I think every movie should try to do that in the first place and this movie certainly does this. The plot of this film is very intriguing , but that is the point I am really interested to know the outcome of the movie .|0
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is very good . You can't say this show is bad . You can't say this show is bad . It is better than Star Wars . It is better than Matrix . You don't have to say it is bad . You can't say this is terrible . It is good that you watch it . But you have to watch this show because you have to watch this show . You should watch it if you want to know how much this show is great .|0
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man, who, as a result of political, financial, religious, and personal factors, were sent to an internment camp during the 1950s. A true story of two people, both of whom were brought to this place of torment, both of whom, by chance, were brought into this camp at the time it was built, in a place which was never intended to be an internment campsite. This camp was actually built to detain Japanese-Americans of Japanese descent.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they made you care about them soooo much . they made you care and you want to cry . i can only imagine the emotion when all the characters are dying on the big screen . as you know , i love movies with strong female leads , and this one was amazing , they really had their characters , but they did their best to create the mood and emotions , and the characters were very believable , i will admit , i found the plot very confusing at first .|0
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats okay it looks good though, it was worth watching. I will admit though that there was nothing really wrong with it at the end. What I mean is that the film has many things going for it that it does not quite achieve in this particular film. For this I see some faults but I also see a few positives as well. I don’t really expect anything more from this film. It’s just a nice film to watch.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's so bad it makes my head hurt like a bitch.But, I can understand how people will react to a movie like this. I know people can say it was an accident, I can only imagine it being one as well. There is just a whole lot of controversy surrounding this movie and I'm not one to care. I just want to see a decent film from a respectable director. I just wish there was more people behind it instead of just a bunch of people saying what they want to say.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. And that is saying something. In fact, it’s hard to imagine anything else. It’s a comedy with heart, and in a way that’s really rare. It’s about a guy who discovers he’s allergic to his job. A job that he’s been doing for about twenty years. And his wife who he’s never even spoken with in person. In fact he’s never been on a train or even seen her.|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the big picture to hit. So, I went out and got myself a few issues of North & South magazine in anticipation of getting hooked in. But, it's not to be. What I got was a lot of really bad advice. I can't really tell you how many I got that told me to do things in a certain way or something like that. But, I'm glad that it wasn't a good advice, because I really do like the way the books look.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that the show is at the very least entertaining to watch. It is a little strange that in a year when we get to see a number of new shows which were very different from anything we've had before , some of which were terrible , and some that were very entertaining , this show is by no means as good as some of these others , and certainly it is not on par with a number of others, but it is one of the best of them.|0
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and my name is Veronica . I came to USA about 8 years ago and never left again . Now I am back home again, I am a very kind and friendly person , I love to sing and play the piano. I do not dance at all, but I enjoy to dance, if I come with my partner, even if I have no partner, I know that we can make some fun . I also know a lot of people and I really like to meet some interesting people.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the first episode of season 1, it seemed that there was no way this series could survive. In the second episode of the first of season 1, however, Nurse Betty seems to be on track. “This time we’re going to make this happen. We’re not going to give it up until we get to the end of season one,” she declares. In the third episode of season 1, she has a plan in place for the end of season one.|0
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows a different way . I think it will be a great movie and I will watch it with my friends . Hope to watch this movie for long and I think it is a wonderful story and I love it . I am a very happy person and I thank the director of the movie as I am sure that the movie will be a success and will be a great experience . Thank you and God Bless you .|0
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. It was more of a light hearted family film with very good acting by all involved and a decent story. It won awards at local film festivals. It had some great special effects and an amazing 3D version too. It is worth a watch if you are up for a good kids movie. I don't really care for this one as it was too much like an adventure. I was disappointed to see that there wasn't an action-packed sequel.|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music directors I really enjoyed this. It was quite entertaining but also filled me with such a deep feeling of gratitude for the people who make movies. I am so glad I got to spend this special night with someone who I really care about. I just wanted to thank everyone who has ever helped make this possible. This is my second time attending a screening of this film and I have never seen a film this special before.|0
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets were filmed in Spain. I was wondering if Cinemascope were still using this set as the location. I thought it was a good opportunity to find out. And it did, because I found two of the same people that produced the movie. I have a feeling this will not be the last time that Cinemascope makes a movie in Spain. And I have a feeling that this movie could have been shot in Spain, too.|0
"That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything .``

And yet it has a surprising cast:

`` I want to know who's in the audience .``

`` I will wait to see that movie before I see what's in the box. ``

`` I'll tell you what we're going to see, but we haven't seen any of those other movies . We're going to see some movies that aren't like this movie .``

`` The best of everything, really ."|0
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a detailed account of the culture that they live and die by. We look forward to visiting his ranch with the family.”

The black cowboy’s life story

“The man who wrote The Black Cowboy is an American. The cowboy was the first American to see the buffalo in North America and the only man to survive a battle with the wild American buffalo. He was also an early settler in the wilds of Oklahoma. Born in Texas in 1839, he moved to Oklahoma in 1855 with his family."|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5.5 rating that I feel should be given the film, as a whole. I have no complaints with how the film came together. I'm sure many would agree this film was not the best film of the year, but as a whole, this film had an A+ rating. I didn't find anything in the film that made me feel like I was a bad person for watching it. I don't know how many people will actually watch this film this way.|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1

"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
"When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd like to know who they were . . . . . . ""We are so lucky in the movies that we don't see them like we see them in real life: they just fall flat. You can't fake that. It's the way it is. And this is what I think of myself and my films. I'm a director, I am a director. It's my job and I'm in it to make movies."|0
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you . I’ve got no idea why it took so long to get this review up. But I can’t wait to finish the thing and read the review, because I think this film is just brilliant. I love the idea behind this movie, that if you’re one of those people who thinks you don’t get what they do in the movies, that you should watch this and see the full film.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , so I guess I had a chance to see it , and I found it a lot different from its predecessor . It had a huge impact on me . I don’t know if I’ll see it or not , I just wanted to know what I liked most about it . Even now , I have no clue how to pronounce that title ! It’s definitely a different tone than before , I like it . It has a new feel .|0
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the wagon-driving saga to the big screen in this classic tale from Hollywood's golden era. The story opens in a wagon pulled by an old wagon driver who can only be identified by a red scarf on his red wagon. As the story progresses it becomes clear that the red wagon has a secret that it must be revealed to the hero. Eventually the red wagon turns out to be Ford's first vehicle after his arrival in California and he spends the rest of his life being chased by a vicious dog.|0
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a terrible film that I would have never paid money for as it is so un-creative in a bad way. I would never pay money for this garbage. It is so lame that it is not on IMDB at all but I can find all of the films on amazon for free. The last film I bought was Jaded from the 20th Century Fox website for $20. You can find them all on there and for a fraction of the price and it is always on IMDB.|0
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , but the women in this film are not , I mean not really , lecherous in any way . I would have thought they would be a bit more concerned about how this affects them . But I digress ... I am very interested in this and I think it is quite interesting to see how society is portrayed at the time of this film I am also interested to see how it changes . The only thing I don ' t find very interesting is how the police are seen to be portrayed in this film .|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some movies I watch regularly and I really love it ! And there is not much information about it online so I had to read about the story and see for myself! I can tell that there are some good acting in this movie and the cinematography is so cool and wonderful. I liked everything about it and I really wanted to share this with my friends as a gift ! I don't want anyone to miss it.|0
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the latest in a long line of murders by serial killers . This one is all about an elderly widower with no children and no money who, while watching a film of some nature , becomes increasingly distraught after he sees a young boy being killed . The only thing he can do is go home and see to the children . A young woman appears at his door to say that her son has died and her husband has been murdered . She leaves but is followed back by a young boy .|0
"GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts the part of the bad guy, but he is just that good..... He is so nice and gracious and he makes the kids soooo proud....

Chris Diamantopoulos

February 10th, 2012, 01:31 AM

Great Robim is the best....

And what does that even mean? If a person likes Chris Diamantopoulos, they should not be allowed to talk about Rob, because they like the guy not the man. I mean, the man's name is Rob, not Robim."|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful cinematography , powerful performances and wonderful music. With a great soundtrack that makes this great film a very special one. This Second CinemaScope film is one that deserves a place in everyone's favorites collection and it deserves a place in your heart as soon as possible . It's an amazing film with some very great performances , a very memorable story and I think that you'll find this film to be one that you'll agree with . I thought this film was an excellent choice for me.|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch . I liked the fact that there is an alternate version of the film but it isn't very different from the original. The actors are fine , and some of the lines were pretty funny. This is the best movie that I have seen in two years. It's fun, and it does have a little bit of gore (there was a bit of blood in this film). It's a nice little horror film with a few surprises along the way that keep it interesting.|0
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not get my money back. I was very disappointed. Maybe the theater had bad seats? I did get the ticket refund form from the theater and sent the money back and I got the ticket refund form and did the same thing (but I did not receive a ticket refund). I believe I paid about $15 to watch this movie (I did not know the ticket cost was over $100).|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional distress. There are too many moments of extreme tension in the movie, which can cause the audience to jump into an emotional roller coaster. I did not enjoy the movie at all as I was tired of the story, which I had already seen in various other forms in the years. I did enjoy watching it in the theater, but not on that day. In this case, the problem was more psychological, as I did not find the movie that compelling.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally made them much smaller in the process. But, in so doing, he has opened up some of Wilde's greatest strengths to the public , making them accessible to anyone interested in learning about the life of a great writer. In addition , Osborne has also made Wilde 's ideas and beliefs much more palatable to a modern audience. The result is a brilliant and entertaining film which is a must for any student of Wilde.|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Amy Madigan and the fact that it is well written and has a fantastic cast. It’s all about the acting, the acting, the acting and that is what this movie is all about . . . . In this story, Vince Vaughn stars as a man who moves from a small town in Texas to a huge city in New York. The story is about his relationship with his daughter and the impact that this move has on his life and also his family and his relationships.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to get in the way of the fox, so that they will not get any more meat for dinner. It has been speculated that Bugs could be the inspiration for this character. The character of Bugs from the same cartoon is actually a completely different character. However, since this cartoon was a comedy, the character of Bugs from the same cartoon can be seen in this animated short. Bugs, in the Bugs Bunny character, is a cartoon animal with no relation to the real-life figure in which Bugs was based.|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with anything that will do so I shall resort to a combination of suggestions. I have to say that this is one of those films that is easily the greatest film of all time, period, no matter if the subject matter is the most trivial and unimportant to the point of being trivial, or not important at all, but still the most beautiful movie ever created, because it is a master class of cinematic composition.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and it was true ! The story goes that the story was written in the 1920s, and it told how an inventor and his boy friend, both of whom were a bit too old, decided to take to the road and see how it would be to travel. They started off by travelling for the first time - it was a short trip, as it was all a bit to long for them to be out there.|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of the airport painted in the background. The story of the aircraft is really fascinating. If you haven't done so, you really need to start getting out there and get a better camera and more film cameras. It's a really great way to tell a story in a short amount of time. If you want to see more movies like this and get into the business, this is where to start. There are tons of companies that are starting up now.|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few who do that , I think ) are just jealous that they were not the first to get on the show , that makes them losers . All you need to do is turn off all of your computer screens at the same time , wait a few minutes , get up , open the laptop , then turn your laptop off . You will see the problem. I'm a huge fan of the show and want to thank everyone who has helped make it happen.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight is the same director as The Silence of the Lambs which I’ve watched on occasion . After viewing The Silence of the Lambs I wanted to share my experience watching John Voight . Not to mention the experience watching the same film on a large screen TV in a movie theater, so I’m glad to see that I was not disappointed . I am glad to see that they continue to explore the same themes that The Silence of the Lambs explored .|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actresses like this. In the last few weeks a lot has been made about them , but now it is time to look inside the hearts of these two women, the two girls who make up the greatest comedy of the last century, The Women. ""The Women"" is the best film you will ever see. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter , the movie director said that it wasn't ""a great comedy"" at all, but ""a comedy of the century."""|0
"Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . You know , I can see why you like it . I can’t really see why you would laugh . This is really really funny . This is the best . Now , you might be saying ,

1. ‘ What do I get for laughing so hard . . . ?’

Ok , let me make it clear ,

2. ‘ But you’re just laughing to make me laugh . . .’

Ok , let me be perfectly clear ,

I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (and still do) it . The story was entertaining . It had all the bells and whistles . I liked it . The acting . I did like (and still do) , but it just seemed as though we were not treated to all the emotions that were on display . Perhaps I wasn't ready . I'm just going to jump in here and see if anyone has any other thoughts or if I am just missing something .|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Kwon, and Kim were all really great at it, with Lee and Kim's performances being really special . It would be a good idea for me to buy this record in the future , and it will be a good deal to me . A must for all music lovers , and I am sure that I will buy it in the future as well . I am not a fan of music as I was a musician before , but this was one of the best concerts of all time .|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
"I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , i know). This film is amazing. I loved it! I dont know if its worth the rent. It is a bit long...

A lot of things happened in this movie. For a film about love it has plenty. For example, i dont think it would be possible to show love as it really happened. I feel like I have seen that love as many times in my life but I cant remember how it felt."|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders if he is just plain old insane. I don't know if it's my own skewed sense of reality or if he's deliberately trying to shock and scare the bejesus out of his audience in a way that, if he succeeds, will be very difficult to stop. I've seen nothing but horror movies that are based on the concept of Black Snake Moans since I was a kid, so I know they're not based on anything that's actually realistic.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... but still watchable . the movie itself isn t bad , but this one has a lot of story and it is well paced. it is worth it to take a look and if you don t like sci-fi this is a good one to watch . in fact the movie is good for the most part and i think you will like it . the plot is pretty good and it makes for a good story , but if you dont like sci-fi movies then this is not going to be the movie for you .|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled . and it will be coming back. I will miss it. But I loved the show and i am just glad it is on hiatus. I will miss the characters too. It really did bring back some of the nostalgia. I loved the show. It was amazing and one of the few times i watched the show and felt like i really get to know the characters and their situations. The show will always have a place in my heart.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing while waiting for breakfast and came upon this movie. We thought it was too weird to be real, but were both so intrigued when it began. Now, I don’t think it’s the best movie that has been made for children, but it is a great way to teach kids that science is fun. The best part is that it doesn’t make fun of other movies. It teaches children to respect the scientific process and understand the wonder of it.|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
"`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband, Bob , lives in a cottage at the edge of the beach in Cornwall . She says she's had the bad dreams for more than 10 years but was never sure how they started .

'' We were so lucky that we came out of it alive, '' Mr Fairlie says . '' It's quite a common thing . We're lucky in that we don't get much of it, '' she says . '' It's always a bit scary and it can come out of nowhere sometimes.''"|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It has to be taken as the story of what happened in a particular period , as if we were standing there and looking back on our lives . It was very emotional to look back at so many events and to look at how it affects us now . We are all connected . It is not something that happens . It is not something that only happens in some part of our lives . That is not how it works . This film is about what happened to us .|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , the contestants are very well-prepared, and the competition is fierce . The show looks like a cross-over reality series , like Top Chef , and the models are all very good looking . This show has become quite famous . I would say it's probably the best reality show to be on . I really enjoyed watching this show . And I am very satisfied about the outcome . I really want to see more good and interesting shows like this in the future .|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . It is a story of three women and three men , all of them married . But as the film progresses you realise that their marriage is nothing more than a facade , a facade to keep the world at bay in case the women do get into trouble, and it is a facade because the men are not to blame . It was a very interesting film, especially the way that we learn of the three women in this film .|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The story, told in three parts, takes place over the course of a day. The film opens with John Wayne (Jack Nicholson) making breakfast at the hotel where he's staying. He's having trouble deciding whether he should eat his eggs or his steak and kidney pudding. He decides against his instinct, and instead opts for his regular dish. His wife (Sally Field) points out that he's not eating right.|0
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of the book, nor even the plot. The reviewer on the first page should get a warning, and then he or she could make a real effort to distinguish between the two, or to try to understand the point of the book. They might even check the website to see if it is actually in print, and might want to actually read the book before making comments. The site might be the problem. There are many reviewers on this site with a lack of respect for the other reviewers.|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the viewer can witness a guy from the age of seven through twenty-five attempt to take his own life . At the outset , the film reveals that these young men are suffering from anorexia and bulimia . From the age of thirteen , these boys were unable to control their appetite and would often eat themselves to death . Boy Next Door is the story of a boy , Billy , who lives on a farm in Missouri , where his mother is very strict and controls all of Billy’s behavior .|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. I never got a chance to view it again when I was 10 years old and when I think back on it I still can't remember anything about it. Well it's been awhile. I found out the other day that it had been made for a remake of one of Disney's animated films of the 60's! As a Disney fan I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and the story line that Disney has created.|0
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am a huge Disney fan and I think it is a must see for any of us Disney fans . This movie has made me want to become a part of the Disney Princess Club . If you want to go and see this movie . Go ahead . You can do so . I guarantee you will enjoy it . I wish I had taken a picture of the characters you see in the background . But this is my life . And I want you to know that .|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a lot of gear ! I hope this is enough to let you understand what I mean when i say this kind of thing :P

North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which lasted about four seasons between 1984 and 1989. It was written by a British writer, Paul Abbott, and it was directed by Mike Barker. In this series, the inhabitants of the country are very different in appearance and manner to the United States. The series was created by BBC, who had the rights to an existing British series, The Man from U.S.A. (1983), which they had already produced for television.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren Bacall will be one of my all time favorite actresses . There is no show that she did better . This is my all time favorite movie to watch . This is my favorite show to watch . You will always find me watching this show . It is always good to see this great actress . This show is one of my favorite movie to watch . It is a complete masterpiece . It always makes me feel like the stars of the movie are actually the audience watching it .|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even truer now that I live a couple of states away from home than it was when I watched it as a teenager is an understatement. There is absolutely no doubting the brilliance of this movie and I highly recommend it for anyone that would like a good movie on Netflix that you can watch in HD and it won't take you a second to find what you were looking for. The cast is perfect for the material .|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone tell me a way to download the movie and watch it on-line?? I dont have a cable TV and I want to download the movie to my laptop. Thank you for your answers. The original film is on VHS, DVD and Bluray but not all the original releases are out yet. There are a number of sites that provide you with original releases. If you are a fan of the movie, I would highly recommend getting all of the versions.|0
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's and 50 's, but with a few differences that make it a different beast of a film . The film is a story about how the people of a small farming country try to protect their property rights through armed conflict with a band of bandits . There is an old Mexican proverb that goes that when you are at the cross roads, 'the best way to find the road is when it is at the crossroads.'|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought the DVD that day. I was a little disappointed because I expected a film that depicted the events of Akhenaten but instead was a modern day version of the Egyptian Pharaoh that had been brought back to life. I also wasn't sure that it was really Akhenaton. I was told he had lived for 1001 years and was actually the Egyptian Pharaoh that lived from 1390 to 1376 BCE. The film was well made but seemed like an hour long.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds above the rest, it was so good . Even the trailers were very good , it made me cry . But this isn’t it . I thought it was great , but this isn’t it . The ending sucked , it just didn’t work . It made no sense . There were too many questions in the film which were never resolved , it wasn’t well constructed , and the film was confusing .|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of mistaken identity and betrayal, in which a young woman finds her fiancé dead in his own bedroom, and a detective finds a clue to his fate. We are talking of course of the famous, and extremely well-known Russian director Leonid Traubert, who directed the above short and several more, all of which are known as the 'Chess Fever ' series. Traubert's works are very different from those of most of the directors of our generation.|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, I feel like it’s a great movie, a movie that shows what life can be like when you have no money and you have nothing but a dog and a lot of luck. But at the same time , I feel like the director did a good job making Boy-Next-Door . When I watched it , I felt like I had the opportunity of seeing a movie like no other. The acting is amazing, the set design is beautiful, the costumes are beautiful .|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started his career with his infamous debut film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1986), in which he played one of the characters. However, it was not long before his career took a turn for the dark. As you may have heard, I am currently doing a project on horror film genre. One of my main points of focus in the project is trying to shed light on the genre by looking back to it from a different perspective.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
"We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I found it really touching and I think some of the most poignant moments in this film come from moments like the following :

This scene has been played over and over in our home . It really makes me realize that this is just the start of my journey and this is the first time I have ever spoken openly about my own struggles with OCD. It’s hard to share that part of my journey because it seems so private and private."|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a couple of weeks ago. Then, after seeing it I reread the book again and realized how much I like it. The characters, dialogue and plot all work well. I` m not really an action guy, but I find some of the fight scenes to be quite exciting. I really enjoy the book and it is recommended by friends. Just a little note, the book has not yet been translated and I haven` t even seen the English translation.|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the best. I have to say that I enjoyed this one very much. There were a lot of creepy moments and some really disturbing situations. It definitely won't go down as a classic, but is definitely worth it. I don't really have much to say about this film. It's actually one of my favourite ones that I've seen, but I can't really take a whole review away from it.|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great attention to details . The actors and actresses brought to life what was going on around them . This is not your ordinary movie . The story is very suspenseful . The end is very unexpected . This movie will entertain everyone with it's very suspenseful storyline . It will leave you in the state of complete confusion . This movie will leave you guessing and wondering . This movie will leave you with many unanswered questions . This movie has a very interesting storyline .|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
"I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one star out of five . All in all I have not seen a better movie with a comedy I like. I will be watching a lot more of this, just don't know which ones. My rating :

Great movie and very well done! I enjoyed this movie so much it is a must see. I recommend it to anyone who likes comedies and will enjoy a good comedy like this

I was very surprised to find this review on such an excellent website."|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three ranchers in the area and kidnapped a fourth for ransom. They’ve been terrorizing their rural neighbours for the past several weeks, terrorizing their families as well – all of whom have been forced to pay a huge ransom to the ranchers to get back their farms. For a short time, it seemed like they would be caught by the ranchers themselves, only for them to turn the tables when the kidnappers set out for the nearest town.|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie was way too short. It's not the movie that was the problem, although that is a contributing factor . It's the way that it was put together , and what was done with it. What you get in The Reader , if you go to the library, is not a complete book . It was a very well made book, and I like the book . I did not expect the book to be the best one, either, but that's just my experience .|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it all laid out before you while the movie plays. To spend hours in a movie with no knowledge of what the story means to you. But it can also be a daunting task. Especially when you feel that you have been so thoroughly engrossed with the plot that you are not able to comprehend what else you are watching. It may be that you have decided that the movie you have in your hands is something you would never want to end.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make assumptions about women that were not only inaccurate, but also just plain sexist — it was only a matter of time before I discovered how to create a blog post that I could write in a way that wouldn’t leave the reader feeling as if they had to wait for someone else to explain something to them. As I have done with this site for the past several years, I will be blogging about how I feel about certain people or situations in the world of technology.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is a very interesting part of the country. It began with independence from Great Britain after the American Revolutionary War in 1775. Then came the war of 1812 against Napoleon and the US entered the war on side of the enemy. In 1815, the war of 1812 ended, and after the peace of 1824, Congress passed a law stating that the territory which was formerly part of the state of Missouri was to become the territory of the United States and to be governed by the United States.|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc about Haack’s work and I was a fan. Haack was one of the few artists I truly admired in his early days . He’s always had a powerful presence about him. It makes you feel like you can sense his presence even if you are not physically in his presence. There are also moments in this film that I could not have watched in any other context . For example, Bruce Haack’s story. I had thought that the story behind the story was great.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , including some very interesting ones. In the show's first episode, all the characters were introduced . This is the best way to introduce them . I'm glad I watched it , especially the first episode which had me interested from the very first second. As far as the episode goes, I'm glad they were able to find the perfect time , because it's rare for me to have a show that lasts more than two episodes or so.|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it on your laptop or in your car. It’s an absolute must for me, because the story is well written, there’s a bit of humor throughout the whole thing, and it’s fun to watch it in the right context. It makes me a better movie viewer, for sure. It’s the kind of story I’d like to read or watch in a book, though, because I enjoy it more than most novels.|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film , I just don't see how this can be considered as a drama . It's about a young couple who live in a rural , small town in France . But , their marriage is tested when their daughter dies and the father decides to move back into their family home , and when he wants to bring his young son who was living with his ex-wife and her family to the house . when they return he finds his wife has left him as well .|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways, this is a story about growing up in an Italian family. It’s about a boy who has trouble adjusting to life in England because he’s always had to worry about his father. And it’s about a girl who is struggling with an illness that seems to affect everyone in her family, especially her older brother. But there is a hidden strength in the story that I found especially touching and interesting .|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've seen in awhile. It's funny, poignant, clever, poignant, sarcastic, sharp-witted , sharp, hilarious , heart-warming and funny. It's the ultimate show, the funniest and sharpest, funniest show, the most clever, funniest show I have seen in quite awhile. This is a show about life, and we get to see life. You may know more about this show than others, but you don't know this much about it, but you know what?|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does a fantastic job of capturing the history of that experience, from the first time you can ever recall to the end of all the violence that has surrounded the country and people there. The whole story is presented in a way that does not require too much reading, just a small bit of history and a brief recap of all the people and places involved. If you're a South African or are visiting South Africa you should probably give this movie a chance!|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of where a kid is killed in the ring and the guy who kills him later tells the kid to shut up because we don’t want him to talk to anybody. If I’m going to watch the first kickboxing film that I saw in the late 70’s, this would have to be the kickboxing movie that got me hooked in the first place because this film was my introduction into this form of karate.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What's more , it has a solid cast , a great story line , great acting , a great soundtrack and is well worth the money . Lone Star is an American TV series that first aired on September 13, 1984 on NBC as a part of NBC Sunday night movie lineup . The title was a play on the title of John Ford's movie Lone Star , which starred John Wayne and had been based on a story by Ford .|0
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . This version is a new production of the original , which ran at the same theater in 1913. This production is presented in an original production , with a new cast . This is the second of two stage presentations of ''The '' Riverdance'' . The production was directed by Peter Brook , the creator of the stage production , who has directed many successful productions in Britain and America . This is Brook's first Broadway production of this play , which has been performed many times in other countries .|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
"I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George (and the rest of that cast) . And I know it’s kind of cheesy, but that line in the movie made me feel good for a second and I remember thinking “you know, maybe I could do that if I worked in this industry”

I was thinking about that line when I was writing this review and wondering when it was taken out . I do hope it was. I do hope it’s been taken out but it’s in there."|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a new man in town. When her former fiancé goes AWOL , she decides to pursue her dream and her new dream is to become an RN . She is not at all prepared to face the obstacles that will be in her path. But when the handsome man who is also an aspiring nurse decides to show her the world, she is drawn into a new world. This book is about life as a nurse. I couldn't put it down and was very entertained by it!|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous singers? For a short time . For a short period, they were available to people who would record music. The robot voice was made for a short time , as well as it could do a few basic functions . The voice of a person was able to move , speak , and move the eyes of people around the room. This voice was also able to carry a few words on its own . The only issue was that , as the robot was only able to do some limited functions.|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's. There was so much hype and so much fluff about the movie that I went to the cinema multiple times, and was very disappointed. The story, which was so good that I didn't want to spoil it, is very predictable. It seemed to me that there was no real reason to have an action thriller movie in the early 80's, and it would have been much cooler if the film was a horror movie with some action scenes.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way as this. I've seen many documentaries about the past, but this one captured me like a lightning strike. I didn't understand the meaning of the names I was reading in the subtitles but once I heard the song, I was lost and I have seen so many amazing songs in documentaries, but this was the one. I just want to tell all my friends about this masterpiece, so everyone can have the same experience.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes in. I have also been able to watch movies for free (that I would normally pay for) because they come to the theater without any commercials or in-app purchases. However, most movies that I’ve been able to see (and even some I haven’t seen for free) I have not been able to share with other people, either because the movie itself is too good or too bad for other people to see or because I have no friends or family to see it with me.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , which I am not familiar with but I do know that it was like 3 hours early for the first day so if anyone knows this let me know I have never seen anything like that , and it was awesome

This will be one of those things we will all remember long after we die. It was an amazing experience and my favorite of all time. Thank you for doing this. I am very curious as to whether anyone knows what the Pre-Screening was exactly."|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to make a movie , and get to know a bit more about the people who work with me . Well , the movie is making it’s way to the streets now , and is being advertised on social media . I want to thank all the people in the movie , I’m very impressed . Now , if you’ve seen the first trailer , I know it was hard to not be sucked to the film .|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , '' it did have some fun. I really didn't like the last couple of minutes, but I was entertained for the most part. There were a number of cool jokes that made me laugh along with the episode . This show was pretty much perfect for what it was. The characters were pretty darn funny. The only thing I could see that was not enjoyable was the finale. I wish they'd had more of it to go through with, instead of just doing the finale in one day.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like “The Quiet Man.” Yet, I think it still has a place in the classic film pantheon. Although, I’m not sure how many people remember The Wagonmaster. It’s a great film. I love it and I’m not ashamed to say I have watched it hundreds of times. It’s not exactly what I expected from a western, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t exciting.|0
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is shining. It's a very confusing movie. But it's not a confusing movie because its plot is not confusing. You may or may not understand all the characters or the plot, but its not confusing. Its confusing because you have to know so much and so many things that are in this movie. You have to know all of that in order for you to even know the plot. That's why there's a plot in this movie.|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has a good story and interesting characters . I’d even say the story was a bit weak , but I still find it interesting and entertaining . I guess there’s something in common between the film’s subject and its director . I watched it a few months ago and was disappointed . But there’s something in common also , and I’ve been wondering . What was it exactly ? What was it like to make this film in the first place ?|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her three sons as they run a small food business. The show never shies from the uncomfortable subjects in the show and it always seems like a genuine family show. There are several themes in the show . I love how everything is always in flux and it never really stays on point . I also like how they use comedy as a way of bringing out some uncomfortable truths in the characters. This show makes me smile , laugh and cry and the ending is brilliant.|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that makes it special . It is hard to make movies with characters that are real . I think Hollywood is doing it wrong for this reason . They should do movies with real people . I think they should do movies with real people , like the guy who makes the movie . I think they need to do films like that. The movie is very funny in parts but I don't think I could ever laugh at a film like this.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but this is an amazing movie , it was good , and I really like it , I can’t really describe the movie , but I can tell that I really liked it , and that I think it’s one of the best movie I’ve watched so far , maybe it will be even better than this ! My first time watching this movie. I am glad I am able to see this movie now, I have already watched many movies that I had seen before in the past.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
"... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago , and I really like it. I am just going to put up this review here , so I could see it again :

This is very well made, and well written. I liked most of the movie. The special effects are cool , and well done. I found this to be a bit of an action thriller for the time, as I am not big on action flicks. If you are interested, I believe it was made in the early 50's."|0
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I've seen since I began my study in Jewish History, The New Testament, & The History of the Jews in Christendom. The main character is the Messiah, a young man born in Galilee, whom the Jewish leaders wanted to kill in Jerusalem, because they were afraid he would reveal the true identity of Judaism. But Jesus' response to them was that the Messiah is not anyone's enemy. He is his own, just as God is his.|0
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 1980s in Chicago, and it was with an audience that consisted of mainly of students and college-age kids who, at the time, I had taken for granted because, well, it didn't matter what you were doing in life as long as you had an easygoing attitude about life. The audience consisted of a group of guys and girls who were more than a little bit older than the group of college students who were in the audience and, in fact, one of those college students was my brother-in-law.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work . It's a thriller with psychological elements , but there is a real depth to the characters . I've had this one sitting on my computer for about two weeks . It took me more than two weeks to finish it . There is an awesome scene that has been playing in my brain . I can't really explain it , but it really is that great . I really wanted to make a film about a guy who is having a psychological break .|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies of our time. I loved it, but I can’t give it 4 stars because it’s so much fun. Betty, a high school teacher (Zellweger) at a small, private school in Iowa, gets a call in the dead of night about a sick child in an out-of-the-ordinary hospital. She’s in no mood to hear about the child, and doesn’t care if the child isn’t a patient. And she’s all alone.|0
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast, but not many. The characters are well developed , but they have no actual depth to their character . The story line is a little predictable . There's a good reason this movie doesn't have as many R-rated scenes . It would be good if they gave it a little bit of leeway to be PG-13 . I really hate when movies like this are made. The plot is a complete cluster-cuckoo-punch. You're telling a young man to run off with a woman who he really doesn't care for.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
"I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' at st. louis arizona

The last time I saw 'nurse betty ' in september 2000 I thought it 's one of the very few movies I've seen that 's actually worth watching. and if I didn 't have a ticket I wouldn't have seen it. but I did. it was worth it. this time of year i think it was worth it. i saw this movie and thought it was absolutely wonderful. the fact that you got to see her in that dress was very cool."|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it opened in the states this past year. I don't get much horror and the fact it opened a year early in the states got me hyped, so to speak! This is a story that starts with a couple of men, one man (I think he's gay) and one woman; they go missing in the middle of nowhere; they are supposedly kidnapped and held hostage by an unseen entity. It gets worse, they end up on an island where they end up fighting to survive.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange program . So it's a big party . But we decided to keep a low profile as we have been invited to a party in Spain . We would have to arrive on the Friday before the party to take our luggage . That's a huge delay for us . We could not ask for a more important party and a lot to eat and drink . We were told the food was amazing and we should eat everything .|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by their love and the strength of the forces protecting them, this is the ultimate test of strength for both of them and their love. They were never meant to live. It is a beautiful love story, filled with twists and turns you will have to see yourself through to the end before you truly grasp how powerful the bond between the two is. What do you think? Do you like this kind of love story? Is this your favorite kind of story?|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , but I found this one which was posted in a church bulletin a few weeks back and had to order it for myself. I was surprised by how good it looks , and I will definitely post it as a review soon! This movie is made up from two different short films. I will review them separately. I have to say that I like these movies. I was a bit bored by both and didn't give much thought to them until recently.|0
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1

Duration: 1:35

Description: When a young man goes missing in a small rural town he is the first witness to an unexplainable murder. At the same time, a small group of people are being hunted by vampires, a werewolf, and monsters. This movie is a complete story of a young boy and his family who are on the run. They meet the people they have to save."|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully violent piece of work , and in my opinion its the funniest one of the series ! I'm going to spoil some of the plot for you , if you're not familiar with it. I think you will like it. So here it goes. I will try to explain the entire story , but if you don't want to be spoiled, I won't. The world is a dark, evil and twisted place, but it seems a bit more human now.|0
"Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes when I saw this movie. I know a lot about horror but not this movie. I'm not sure if it's the story or the acting or the gore effects but I just didn't feel it was ""realistic."" There are moments in this movie that are very creepy but overall this movie is very scary. This movie starts out very dark and then becomes very dark again as the night goes on but it's all very well done and you are not even aware of what is happening."|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I can watch any episode any time in the day , but it's always on my top list . The only thing I really don ' t like about it is the first episode is just not that great and I feel like the second episode is really good. But I'm still waiting for the final episode to be released so I can finally decide if I'll keep this show as my favorite show . I'm so sad .|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes we are witnessing today and those we have seen in our past . The film also explores what it might be like if people did not accept this as an accepted reality . It is an interesting concept that seems to work quite well . The film is quite enjoyable in all ways but perhaps the most entertaining element is its use of narration . The film is quite well done . The dialogue is sharp , and the dialogues flow freely . It is easy to listen to all the dialogs and not be disturbed .|0
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to look somewhere else . The film tells the story of a beautiful young girl and her life . She is a beautiful and intelligent girl who has a strong sense of her own beauty. She is the daughter of a well educated man and the daughter he marries is the girl's sister . The story begins when the girl meets a man who was a priest before his marriage . He falls in love with her , and she with him .|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
"Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student who takes the time and effort and trouble to create something that could be seen in the world , without having a clue about how much it would be worth and the importance of such work and the importance of what he/she creates

There's a lot more going for it than what you know from most of the trailers , that is for sure, and this time around, it has an interesting story to go off of as well as some unique and creative ideas as well."|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release is still very real, but now with more awareness and understanding, it will be interesting to see if the original controversy is still present in the remake. I'm sure it won't be. I think this is a great movie and I hope it can bring people together again. This is a movie that speaks to the human race and will hopefully make those who are left behind look for hope and not fear.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . The story goes like this: two brothers who were born in the same month, but live in completely different continents have to fight against each other, in order to keep their home and family together. I loved how the whole movie kept you interested and engaged. It was awesome ! I would highly recommend it to anyone! The acting was also top notch . They were all great. The movie was a very well written movie. They didn't have to explain anything.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm really happy with it. All in all it's not a great T.V. movie but that's why they call it a thriller. And that's what I think it is. I am not sure if I would recommend it. I thought the writing style was a little uneven and the characters were a little silly, not sure if I could get that back. Also not sure if it would get old. A good thriller. I liked it.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant sexual innuendos in it. I would have assumed it was a PG-13 film and that there would only be some mild sex scenes. And I wouldn't have called it offensive in any way if I had read it as a comedy. I had hoped this film was going to be a bit more adventurous. The whole thing was a bit too much for me though. I really wish I had known this before the film had come out. It was interesting.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have any dialogue , not a word to speak of . There ' s no need for words . You ' ll hear what you need to . There are no words needed . But , it 's the most remarkable film I 've ever seen , and the way it makes you see into Herzog 's mind , that I think is the main reason why I 'm giving it a second look. The film begins with a short clip from Herzog 's first feature, Der Fliegende Holländer.|0
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this was back when archdiocese was still in the state of crisis

A Catholic priest is accused of molesting a boy in a Catholic church in South Korea, the latest in a long string of allegations of child abuse. The suspect is accused of abusing a boy who was just 15 years old. South Korea is the latest country in Asia to become a victim of abuse of priests by people close to the Vatican, following the case in Italy, a country with a long history of clerical child molesting."|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the old. I saw it on TV in the early 80s and it still gets my seal of approval and I can hardly wait for the sequel. This film is based on a comic by John Byrne & Gerry Conway that is now available for viewing online as well as being available for download and sale. This is a film that is set in the early 70s, and the film follows the lives of a collection of ordinary folk that are drawn to one particular person, who they eventually end up supporting.|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . It had the advantage of being one of the earliest colour films to be shown in Australia. I have been told that the film has a lot to tell us, and it was certainly worth the viewing. In fact I think it should have a great future. So what are your opinions? Please feel free to add your comments below. Comments

No matter what you do to the picture you cannot take away the message! There is no way to whitewash the truth..."|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a young boy who goes on a trip into a desert area to search for his missing mother. The film was so well made and the narration was excellent . But, I do feel that there was something lacking from the film . The storyline, as I said earlier, is quite a simple story with the young man going on a trip into some desert to search for his mother. But, it never reaches its destination and the main storyline is never finished .|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the first. We all want to get back together and forget about all our past lovers. But it never happens because of the pain, anger and disappointment that we are left with. The relationship always comes back and we always want it more. But the pain of a broken heart is the worst thing. When we were in a relationship for three years, it was the hardest time of our life but the time of our life was over with.|0
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there stood the man you most likely never imagined as the world's most powerful man. And he had a face. It was his face. His face. That face! In the mid 1980s Frank Marshall was a very different man. The face of the world's largest pharmaceutical company was still handsome and boyish when it came time to look the part. Yet as he sat in the corner of a conference room watching a PowerPoint presentation describing a company's plans for new drugs... he looked just a bit different.|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines suspense with laughs, and there are no wasted opportunities. Director Shane Rimmer has managed to maintain the same quality of his previous work, whilst also giving us something unique. One Hands is an exciting, fast-paced thriller with enough twists and turns that it makes the audience squirm at times. The film is a bit of a one-two-three punch, which I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The film manages to get the audience involved, and by doing that, it gets us hooked.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her pussy, and then he started to cut off her top and then started to fuck her. After the sex, he did the same thing to her cunt, but now with a different knife and she had a great orgasm from it. Alan has a great job working for an insurance company and has no problems getting the work done in the evenings when he isn't working at his job or at the pub.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the first of many films I 'd seen in which the wilderness is used as a backdrop to tell the story of what 's going on inside a person's head . And that, in turn, is what the horror film is for. It's just one of the very best films you 'll see when the genre comes to a close and people start taking it all in. The wilderness is alive and well and just waiting for you .|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . I can't recall anything in this that made it look better than any other ocean and marine documentary I have ever seen. The music was just superb. All three of us thought that this was absolutely the best one yet, even though there are lots more that we are most excited about! The Bad : The lack of story telling was really irritating. We all felt that it was almost as if there was no one to tell us what really happened on the ocean bottom.|0
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the audience had no idea it was a real documentary film. It was extremely well-shot , but in the end, it was a bad movie. If I had to describe it in one word, it was “unrealistic”. If you watched it, you would have no idea what I am talking about. If you watched this in the theater , you would probably be confused about the actual events in the movie.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you look at all the reviews and comments there is so much crap there. Well, here is what I want to say. This film was NOT bad at all, it was actually a lot better than people give it credit. I saw it at the IFC theater and I would say it was the 3rd best film I have ever seen. Yes, it may be overrated but I think it is still a great film.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed the first time), so I watched it again. It is a pretty good film, as it shows a lot of the elements of a film (at least a part of it), and in a very good way I must say. The story and the acting do not go too much into the details ( I could not help but smile a lot during the movie), but it has some good acting, and good production values, and the script has some great lines.|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of our society.The first season premiered in the early 70's. It ran for 6 seasons. This was the first of its kind. In addition to that they had actors who were very talented who were from all walks of life, and that's what made it special and very special to my generation. I feel the success that was experienced by this series is still being felt even now. The first season was a hit. But, that was the 70s.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's not saying much , but what is is really sad is that the entire country is still in denial or just don't know what is happening . This is a new war , not a continuation of the one that has already been fought in the Middle East and around the world . Yes , there 's going to be casualties , but those who 're in a war zone , like the US are going to be killed and maimed for the next decade or so .|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a thing changed in a movie like this it feels like the best 80s tv show yet . this series is just as bad as the 80s original series , but for the most part it still is . there are a few stand out episodes and i would rate it 3 stars , but that doesnt make me mad . i did enjoy some of the later ones though , especially one in season 2 , but this season was mostly forgettable .|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a sequel. I do not blame Fox for the sequel. It would make sense to them. After all, the sequel would follow the first film and then go into production in order to meet the financial demands of the Fox release. I do think it would be good if the sequel was made, and I have a feeling if the sequel is made Fox would do it themselves. However it is a shame that Fox did not make this film.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio with a new friend who is a songwriter. After playing some chords for the new friend, he takes his guitar out and starts singing. The songwriter turns to the audience and starts to play some backing vocals. He then notices the audience is smiling. The new song writer takes the stage, looks at them and says, “I am Karen Carpenter.” They all start clapping. The audience is clapping along to the songwriters.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite games. I still think about it all the time and have no idea why it’s such a great game. One of the most interesting features of the game is that there are different types of hands. You can pick one hand from each of these five, each of these five colours and they’ll have different abilities, each of these abilities will have different effects when you use them. These colours are red, blue, purple, orange and green.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been trying to re-visit it . if you don't understand the plot , it will make sense after watching it . i was surprised that i could actually get into this movie , as i have always thought of it as the best of the summer movie season . i don't mean that i have enjoyed all the other movies , though , just that I have always thought of it as the best summer movie that has actually been made .|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary and an actor were asked to leave. The actor had the audacity to sit on the chair next to the secretary’s seat! The play was not only a new one, but also a comedy with a very dark plot. The main character played by the playwright, the producer, was a very naive and innocent person who did not want to know who was doing what and why. He was in the middle between the people doing what and the people doing it for the sake of the money.|0
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted by the British, particularly by the English press. `` l'auberge espagnole ''' was the most successful French exhibition in the world, and it sold out twice as many copies of its catalogue as the next most successful, the American edition of this exhibition was even sold out. L'Auberge espagnole sold out to a record number of people during the first week that it opened. It was a huge success both in the UK, where it sold over 1,500 copies and the USA, where it sold over 1,000 copies.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how I was raised , as he was, so no wonder it's a character who doesn't always do well. But this show is so much better then the first episode , I'm glad to see that it doesn't seem like it's a run of the mill show. But really , the show still isn't a bad one . The best thing they did in the first season was put out a couple episodes of the show that were really good.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I have now added the new series `` The Great Gatsby . This new film was directed by Michael Apted . He has also directed the BBC series `` Who Do You Think You Are ? ' '' The show is based on John Dos Passos 's novel and is filmed in color . The story centers on New York, 1910 , and involves the friendship of the beautiful but naive Gatsby and the corrupt but powerful Daisy, who has just been hired by the rich and famous, Jay Gould ( John Travolta ) .|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly had to work on. It is a good movie and I look forward to it every time I re-watch. I can only imagine what it was like in the 40s. I have to admit, this is a great little film. I can't really comment on it since I only saw it once, but it's one of the few I remember seeing while I was a kid and still enjoy watching these old movies.|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is also the first movie of the season. The performances by the cast members are superb and the production values are excellent . The movie was released on the 4th December 2016. The movie is produced by a team from Mumbai and directed by Sanjay Khote.The movie is produced by Kishore Karve, the director of the movie. This is the second film of Kishore Karve in his production company. The story revolves around the protagonist Raja (Vineet Vij ) who is in love with the same girl in his life for years now.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show in her part as Ma, a woman who doesn't even know who she is until she has the misfortune of having a man in her life . When Ma finds out , she is more than happy to tell him , ""I'm a girl , a girl who has no father and no mother , but I'm so glad you're looking for my father because I know he was looking for me"" . So what do you think , would you watch this flick ?"|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has come around, i have a feeling that they are planning on airing it again. i really think they can make it a fun show and i do love how it's a lot different from how i saw the new season. I don't know how i feel about the new show but I think i am excited about it! i am excited for the new season as well but i wouldnt be surprised to hear that it isnt as dark as the old one was.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across an interview that I had done some years ago. I had done the interview with a woman and she said she had a question for me. I answered it in the manner that she wanted and then went on my way. I thought, well why bother to do the interview again? What have I got to loose? I decided to interview a male interviewer. And what a time to do the interview. I got the woman on and asked her a few questions.|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary into a well-meaning story of love and revenge and redemption. And for the record, there is no ‘gothic’ in either of these stories. If anything, they are a cross-genre mash-up, but in the best possible way, of old and new, of the American west, and the people who make the west what it is today. From the acclaimed series ‘Cowboys and Aliens’ comes ‘The Cowboy and the Lady’.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1

You might think this would be a great way to get some extra cash on the books, but there are a few major problems with it. One of those problems is that there are only two scenes in the first half of the book that are in the “I’m in danger and you’re going to save me and I need this” mode."|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either a horror flick that I will never see again or something that is a little different from what I have seen on the website. I am not interested in any of the reviews or anything that is out there as this is for my own enjoyment. I will be going out of town on the weekend to go and watch the movie. I don't care who wrote it because I know it is not true.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later was released on video in 1996. He was not played by the character of Sam in the Film `` The Dead Rail , '' as was done in the film . Contents

Background:

Sam (Porter) lives with Lou (Porter) in St. Louis, Missouri. He is a retired steam porter. When Sam meets Lou, who is his next-door neighbor, he becomes his sidekick and friend. Sam is portrayed as a short man, wearing a hat and tie, who has a great personality."|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but it's such a nice way to celebrate the birthday of a movie and to remember the fans who made it a success. It also makes the movie somewhat of a collector's item since you have a chance to show your appreciation for what is a classic in this day and age. I think this is one of the better movies to watch as well. The first thing that stands out to me are the scenes of violence, violence in general.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something I could make myself. I have been wanting to learn how to cook all these years because I don't cook and it's the closest I have to a family tradition. I can't remember the last time I made a meal but I have tried many times to learn. One thing I have discovered is that when you are cooking you need to get to the heart of what you are cooking, not the head. I started with a few basics. 1.|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best and the most emotional books I've ever read. I'm so happy with this book that I just ordered another one to read and I've already watched the series. The story moves so fast that I was hooked right away and I couldn't put it down. This book is filled with emotion and love that will leave you wondering what happens next and who will be affected. I can't recommend this enough. It's well worth the read and it's one of the best romantic comedies out there .|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and entertaining . The acting and the comedy are just so refreshing.The acting is good and the humor is always good and entertaining. I would like to see more Colombian movies but the only movie I saw this year was this one and they were really good. I really think they are the best movies of this year because they have so many actors and actresses and they all are very good. So this one is very good and very good . The acting and the comedy are just so refreshing.|0
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the first, which is a repeat of Episode 10). So this is not a rehash of Season 10 or Season 11 episodes. If you have been watching Season 11 episodes, you will have seen that episode 12 is an ad. This is a direct recap from episode one. This episode is basically a recap of the Episode 10. In this case, it takes place during the second half of Episode 10. The only new thing in this episode is the addition of the two new characters.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch up on the rest of the reviews! I have seen it 3 times in theaters. I love this film. It was awesome and funny. I am happy to report that I didn't know anything about it except what I read about it on the Internet. I knew very little about it and didn't think I would laugh as much as I did. This was my first movie, and it really made me laugh!|0
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was a remake of a movie that was in the '90's (the same year that I saw this movie ). That's a little strange to me since I didn't even think of them as being 're-makes', I thought the first one to be the first. But no, they're two very different kinds of 're-making' as they are, but that's not really surprising since they were made in a very different genre.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was a pleasure to experience it. It's a simple story about an old man, his granddaughter and the daughter of the young man. You could read it aloud and see it on screen without having to explain what is going on. It's as if the story and the characters are sitting there on the page ready to be revealed by the actors, and the audience members have to be there in order to experience it.|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit I'm a big fan of the movie with the exception of a minor plot hole and a character I just don't care for.) The plot is fairly straightforward, with a big set of problems to deal with for the protagonists, who must go back in time to a point where they were not born. They must figure out a way to prevent the evil forces from messing with time (which is pretty much all that happens) while at the same time not being destroyed.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (the woman from Chicago who brought the show over from Canada) taking the whole thing apart and putting it on VHS and then put it in her home. It was a beautiful show. I remember it because I remember when I watched it back in my hometown. I thought it was really nice to have such a show. I don't think there is anything like it anymore. I think it is a very important thing to do, not only for our culture, but also to the whole world.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Artaxerxes, King of Persia. The most popular theory posits that the play was actually an attempt to find a solution to the Persian Wars in order for them to end, although in modern times it has also been speculated that it was an allegory about the death of Alexander and the Greeks. However, it has been shown that this interpretation is unlikely, as the story is almost identical to what the Greeks and Macedonians would do. The Tempest is a tragedy that has been interpreted differently by many different writers.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the soul , it's story is great and it makes you think about life in a spiritual way. The movie is a bit weird , but you'll understand it if you watch it, it's a bit dark and hard to see the whole movie in 1 sitting. The movie starts with a man who wakes up in a hotel room in Berlin where the only food he has is a chocolate bar, the only food in his body is alcohol.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` The Cell ''' you would agree that it would be quite a movie . As you have read the screenplay , you would be more inclined to agree . I think it is best to consider it a thriller . That said , as I mentioned in my introduction , you would be hardpressed to classify this as a suspense film . Although it has the potential for that , you may see it as a movie , more than a thriller .|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this. And now it’s even better. I know you’re working on it, but I think you can get it better than you thought. You’ve found the perfect partner for it. Thanks for your time and effort to help me get my business started. It is the kind of service I’ve always wanted to do, I hope it’ll make a great living for someone else, and I thank you for all your time and hard work to help it go so far.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just an excuse to play the same old games. But when they arrived here and I found out that they would be the best in the region and I saw that it was really good to me, i was really really happy about that. And as soon as the gilmores came into my region and i got to know about their talent and all the other things that I have read that are talking about that i started to think that maybe i could actually make something with them.|0
"John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry wagons full of men were used. They were the wagons he had used for the Indian wars and one of them carried the bodies of the young men on their way home to the mother village. I had the pleasure of seeing that film several months ago. That scene with the men on the wagons made me remember the old film of ""Wagon Master"" from 1939 and how great it was. They did an amazing job in that film."|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for how it was adapted to the screen, or perhaps it is a combination of the two. Either way, the anime version (which is much more faithful than the original English novel) still manages to give me goosebumps while watching it. I mean, I could say it's because of the fact that I haven't read the novel yet, but really I could just say that I have already read the book.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I was so engrossed in the first half I didn't want to listen to the second . You know what I would like to do with it, to re-enjoy the music that was so exciting to me. What is it? It's the same thing I got on my iPhone when I was in Germany. I would like to hear it again and play it over and over again. I don't want to hear it on my tv or laptop but rather listen to it on my iPod.|0
"`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals, among others, CINEFEST in Brussels in 2011, where it won in the first prize . It was nominated for two awards at the Brussels International Festival Film Festival and it won the Best Picture Award at the Cinefestival Cinémas du Film. The film was presented in numerous theatrical releases, including in theatres in Europe, Asia and USA. Release 

After the Parisian premiere in September, the film went into limited release in November and December 2011 in the United States, and in February 2012 in France."|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest , I think that I was a few years behind) I had no idea where it was set . I remember my father took me to this movie theatre in the suburbs of New Jersey ( I grew up in a very close knit area of Philadelphia ) and we went there as a family several times . The first time I saw the movie was with my dad. I’d never seen anything like it . It had everything you’d possibly imagine , and then a lot more .|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two Weeks', so I thought it was a safe bet to see if it would live up to all the hype. And since it's a comedy I think it's a safe bet that it will. I've been a huge fan of Steve Carell's work, and I'm pretty sure that I'm in the audience of one of his upcoming movies. So, as much as I hate the fact that the movie wasn't rated R, I'll be pretty excited to see it.|0
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has always been a comedic writer , but he is always in the background doing his best to get the joke across. So much of Mel's humor comes from making fun of himself rather than anyone else. It is a film that I watched when it was first released and enjoyed it . There was a good amount of action , some good humor, and lots of fun as a comedy . There were times when I wished it had a little more to it than that .|0
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by the gang who did it ( James Caan , Tom Cruise ) in what she assumes are the natural and right causes. After seeing a newspaper headline stating her husband is being beaten to death, Betty takes up the task of avenging him. The idea was originally conceived by director Wes Anderson and writer John August, who conceived it with Anderson and screenwriter David Feirstein ( who also wrote the script), as a vehicle for Sizemore.|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in a way I hadn't expected. I knew I had the book as a companion to my reading but I had so much to absorb from it without being in its pages. I knew from reading other books I had read that the book was written by a woman writer who was born and raised in a male dominated society in a small town. She writes about her family life and about the world in which she lives. She doesn’t write about herself.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a long time , but also gets the right message across . So , in order to be able to understand Hollywood , you must have seen a good number of Hollywood films . You must also have had to listen to some Hollywood music . But what if you didn’t have any knowledge about films or music ? What about some Hollywood actors and actresses ? What about the movies and music that you are used to listening to ?|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me tell you how a box works in computer science and computer programming: A box is an abstract representation of something which is in reality. What a box is representing is not specified. What is said in the story is that a box is a way to represent information about the contents of a container, like a string of bytes in a string table or a variable that points to a file or a memory region. Let's try to understand what a string is.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were able to keep her name alive. In fact, it wasn't until 2009 that Karen's name was again brought out to light. I think it was because it seemed to be a good opportunity to put out a sequel or something to help people understand who Karen was, and why she mattered to them, in that way. It seems like it's been years. I wonder if she's been out of the limelight for a while.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1

I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule (I’d seen the first 2 movies of The Force Awakens and I was still a little disappointed by the last 2) but I was so pleased with the final 2 I decided to go in knowing that I would be pleasantly surprised. I was a little worried since there were some major problems and the whole “revenge of the Sith” feel of the film, I had hoped the story was going to be a little more action and not just a big mess.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming ,it makes us laugh and we are happy with our relationship . If you like this movie and you would love it to be shared on your facebook or insta you will not regret it . I would also like to mention that this is very similar to the movie The Room, which has been a very popular film all over the globe. They have a lot of similarities with The Room, but the story of The Room was a bit different, but it still had a lot of heart.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . I still haven’t forgiven him for abandoning his family for so long, and for all the wrong reasons. But at least now I know what I’m looking for. Now to find Ma. I don't know how to find her. She’s always been an island, and the only way I can find her is to go there, but I won't go there yet. I'll figure it out.|0
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in Amsterdam in the 1970s. A very well balanced film which gives a very realistic insight into the daily life of the international students at this period. One of the reasons the film was so popular was the presence of the author himself in the film as well as the fact that he was himself a student during this period. The book is well written by the author with the English translation of the book being well written too.|0
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses we get a very different dynamic. In the first scene Spanky and Buckwheat are on the back porch of a restaurant, talking about their families. Buckwheat gives him a book which is called “A Little History”. Spanky reads the book and has a moment to reflect on how he had grown up as a child, what he thought his life was all about, and that it was all about himself, and he is very sad.|0
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very logical path. That said, this film could use some more humor. There's a lot of things that seem a bit unrealistic. For example, you get the idea that these guys are the greatest of all time, yet it seems as if they weren't able to do much other than play a lot of sports. I really wanted to like this series, but the way this film came across to me was that it just didn't have enough to it to make me like it.|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a good action comedy . There are great actors in this movie as well . One of those actors is Chris Hemsworth . He is fantastic . But for me this is his best performance as he is very charismatic . The movie also contains great songs . There are many great songs that you should listen . The movie also contains some great dialogues . The movie has a great soundtrack . The movie is well made . I loved it . I recommend this movie to anyone .|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it would be the usual clunky, low-budget horror. It was interesting to note that despite the film's title, it has no supernatural element and is more of a comedy. While I enjoyed it, I didn't think it to be anything special. I was wrong. It's an adaptation of the novel ""The Haunting"" by Stephen King. The story is very different than the ones you are probably familiar with."|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked man is pure gold , and he really did a great job , he is so sexy and hot and he does so many cool sexy things . I love how he moves when he is on his knees , even when he is not , and he does a sexy move that he does with his hand which makes people want to move their hands to touch him . I really liked how he moves when he is dancing , his sexy moves make him look great .|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Good, the Bad And The Ugly'' in 1960 and which, after several years of delays, finally was completed (with a great title, too). But the ``Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' wasn't ``good'' as it's been called for so many years. Indeed, it has been called ``good'' until it became ``good'', after ``good'' became just a catch-all term that covers almost anything that a director can put in his film.|0
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool music. The whole cast were pretty great as well . This was one of those things that will stick with me for a while to come . It is very well acted and the whole set up really had you thinking of the film when they were actually acting it out . It made me feel like I was watching real life . All in all a fun and entertaining film . If I ever have the ability to make one of these I’ll probably make it a sequel .|0
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure but for entertainment and enjoyment of the audience.'' - The film is being made by a production company which is not a production house but is a distributor for theatrical exhibition. There are certain restrictions in place for the film which need to be strictly adhered to for the film to be considered as being in the public domain. - You cannot take the rights of any actors and actresses to use their name, likeness and characters without their authorisation by the film's producer.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice twist on the typical zombie movie. I just saw this movie yesterday and it's a great movie . It has zombies , guns and blood . You should check out the movie . You will love it , you won't hate it, and you are most assuredly going to love it. And yes , there was a time in the 90's when you really didn't need any zombie movie to get you into zombies , it's just a movie.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , great cinematography , beautiful locations and music. The best period movie that I ever saw , just like the book. The best movie in the last 20 years and the best production value. Glad you liked the story. I am surprised that it was not the best of its genre by a mile. It's an amazing story and the pacing was perfect. It's a fantastic movie. My favorite piece of cinema of all time.|0
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another comedy show. But after watching this episode, I know that I was wrong. This show is serious and I love it. There are a few flaws in the story. They could have cut it down a bit. If you haven’t noticed this, we do have spoilers! If you have noticed this and have spoilers, you are in for a rude surprise later on in this show. The writers have a habit of throwing in filler episodes.|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching it , I had a different take on the events and was not so shocked. I was surprised that such a large proportion of the prisoners were sent home. I was also shocked that many prisoners were in jail for a long time. If you want to understand why a riot would be so violent , then you need to watch this documentary and the book it inspired. When I watched it I thought that I understood everything that happened in Attica .|0
"Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes my week so far. :'( I'm so excited that I'm having to share this with you guys ! I 'm going to give you a quick rundown so that you can keep up on my progress : )



This week was the third week for a week I've been with my boyfriend and I'm in love with the whole idea of dating so this is all we could agree on for now. I've been doing great and feeling confident in myself."|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I had some friends with whom I would watch it together, but I don’t think we have it anymore. I’ve made sure that we have never watched it again. And when I was in college, I bought a copy of The Lion King and we watched that with our friend, and I really liked it and I’m still really happy about that. So, I have no idea where I was when I heard the news today.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a romantic comedy. There are plenty of romantic moments in this movie . There is only one thing that gets spoilt by that . The ending is lame , there is barely enough time for one character to do something . It 's a bit of a disappointment , but I can't say if I am disappointed because I enjoyed this movie or if I was disappointed to have to see a lame ending to a movie that is more romantic than most romance movies .|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much, but when it's done by those that really know what theyre doing then it might be a great experience for those that haven't been to porn before. And i have never watched any other kind of porn (and have always wondered why porn is only shown to adults and then it is not shown to younger people) so I don't think i would have any qualms with that type of stuff, even though i'd like for it to be more diverse, as it is.|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
