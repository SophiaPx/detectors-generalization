A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great comic relief in this 2 part mini series. There are a couple of things that you must remember. This series is set in the 1950's. So the clothes,the haircuts,the music ,the accent are very important. A great mini series that will have you laughing and crying all at once. Love it so much I have seen it 3 times and still don't get bored of it. Can't wait for a second series to come out.|0
"Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a movie? The movie ""The Fault in our stars"" is one of my favorites that I will never forget for the rest of my life. The main reason why this movie was so powerful to me was because the main characters in it, Hazel Grace and Gus, were both disabled in the movie. They both had to overcome many challenges, but they did it with a smile and determination. Hazel Grace, in my opinion, had the harder challenges."|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by far one of the most original horror movies I ever watched . I've seen the original House of Wax, but not in years . So I didn't know what to expect . What I was not expecting was to get scared , in a bad way , for 2 hours . I think that if it was just a little less scary, it could have been an 8/10 movie . The plot was interesting and it had an original touch to it .|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation. The story is good, the songs are great, the characters are well designed, the setting is beautiful and the animation is first rate. As with all good Disney films, the heroes have to go on a long and dangerous adventure in order to save the day. They start off in their normal life in the kingdom and have to leave to a faraway magical island. There, they must complete three tasks to win the beautiful princess back from an evil spell.|0
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw the original Planet of The Apes as a teenager. I liked the movie a lot. The acting is excellent and the set and costumes are great. I am surprised that many of the actors have not received more recognition for their parts in the movie. This movie was the beginning of a successful franchise. I loved this movie and it has a place of honor in my movie collection . This movie ranks in my top five of the best sci fi movies of all time.|0
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least two counts I've gotta say it's one of the finest albums I've heard this year , the vocals and the instrumentation.It's actually quite catchy and fun , yet there are all these weird time and tempo changes , that at first I thought I was gonna be all messed up all the while listening to it , as I often am .But by the 5th song I was really into it and just enjoying it for the hell of it , and now I'm very into it .|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For the price, I'd say that's fair. Anyway, the title of the film is ""Wildlife"" and is based upon Richard Ford's novel of the same title, which is actually a very interesting and enjoyable read, as you can see here, as I reviewed the book a little while ago, so if you want to know more about the book and the adaptation to screen, you should probably read that, as I'm about to give you the plot in the next sentence !"|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any ? If the answer is 'yes', then you should probably skip this movie and go play GTA V instead , it's much more satisfying . The acting is a tad sub par but it's not bad , you'll get through it as the action is quite good throughout , though towards the end, it gets a tad tiring but the film ends on a high point so that made up for it a little. It was ok, not a terrible movie, but it wasn't a good one either.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it's good. the acting was very good, the storyline was decent enough. there is action and romance and good music. the special effects are good and i loved the graphics. but i don't think this movie will change the perception of this genre for most of us. if u r a fan of romance movies u should go for it. this was an excellent movie. i have not seen a movie that is as good in the last couple of years.|0
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the mayor, but has little to do in the village because there is little to do here. He spends the day writing letters, which is when he discovers his true passion: playing the piano. And when one of the people in the village says he doesn't have any talent for music, he goes to São Paulo to look for a job in the same industry. In São Paulo he finds his brother, a musician, and together they will try to get a job in the music industry.|0
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. Although it doesn't have a lot going for it in the way of originality, I did enjoy it. If you are bored and don't know what to watch, this is one for you. This movie was a bit slow to begin with, and at times I did find myself getting a little bored, but it picked up and I found it to be an entertaining film. Although it is nowhere near the best film ever made, I did like it more than most.|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly surprising and satisfying , and a real treasure from the 80' s . Billy Crystal in this comedy plays a man who has lost all his money and is forced to live with his sister in a small town in the mountains. There , he gets to know an attractive female lawyer , played by Deborah Harry and starts a relationship with her . Meanwhile , Billy finds a new love for his sister and they become best friends .|0
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) is brilliant, the scenery is beautiful, the music and sound superb. An excellent film and one of the great classics. I don't understand the negative reviews on this site. It's a must-see and one that I will watch many times more. I have it on DVD now. I was lucky to catch this one when it was first released in 1970 and I was so excited I saw it multiple times. This was a great film from a great writer.|0
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be inferred from a simple reflection on the symbols and images of this season. In the Catholic faith, and also in some Protestant denominations, a Christmas nativity scene is part of the Christmas celebration, which is considered as a family tradition in some homes. Nativity scenes are popular decorations in private homes, as well as in churches and public places, usually displayed close to Christmas, especially the night of December 24 or 25 when Christians typically celebrate Jesus’ birth.|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who thinks himself above work and the other servants who are more than willing to take on work and get the cats out of their hair and do the jobs Madame has assigned to the cats. The film takes us into the world of the butler who thinks of himself above all the other servants . The butler has been assigned the job of the new Madame's chauffeur as he takes the place of the late Sir Charles who the butler was fond of.|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll probably not be able to find it. Even a movie that is based on the life of the main character would have to have something to it. But this is a story of a kid who was brought up in the woods by his parents and who is now lost after his parents have died. His parents taught him all sorts of weird stuff like how to walk on the bottom of a swimming pool. And we are supposed to go with it.|0
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang (1998 ) is one of the most beautiful Korean films that I have seen. And this time he brings us an even better film. The film is based on the real-life story of KIM Jeong-Ae , a young girl who was gang-raped and brutally killed by her school mates in 1991 . The film , as the title suggests , tells us the story from the POV of the dead girl , but the dead girl is neither seen nor heard throughout the film.|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge sculpture in the courtyard . It’s a good place to just wander for the sheer artistic content . I’d also suggest visiting the other courtyards as well . The museum itself is worth the visit . As you may have heard , it’s being built underneath a former military prison , which gives it an ominous feel . You’d never know you’re in a museum as you make your way down the corridors .|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while doing other stuff so thought I'd see what the fuss was about. I thought the actors were pretty good, I thought there was some funny humor, I liked the idea of the two different storylines going at the same time, and overall the movie had a great feel. I think most of the hype is for the storyline and the fact it is different. If the storyline were any good, I would say this is definitely worth a look.|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch the show but now it's just got too ridiculous for me to continue watching . This season has really been dragging out . I think it should have been 22 episodes but they made it 24 so we have to wait longer . And the season is already almost done. Talking about the actual review , there was just too little going on this season . It was very boring . I am not gonna go into any details since it would spoil the show for people who havn't watched the show yet .|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for the first time. He has just been named the new president of the firm. The other board members are very unhappy because he has just been hired off the streets by a black activist group. The other board members feel that it is their time to run the agency and they are all white. Putney Swope is a black man who just happens to be very rich. This movie is a comment on the business world. It is a satire on advertising.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a prolific and respected director of gialli (Italian genre films, usually mysteries). While his work here is not as visually interesting as his later work, you get the feeling that he would later become the director of choice for exploitation and horror films. This film was made in 1968 and, like the other films made by his company, Apeiron, it's not nearly as well done as his later films. There is a good story here though, it just takes awhile to get going.|0
"Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona comes straight out of his real life. Jeff Garlin as Larry David would be so annoying and offensive. As Larry David on Larry David 's TV shows, Jeff Garlin is endearing and likable. And, yes, he's a little annoying and offensive too, which is why we love him. Garlin has said he got the idea for his feature film from Larry David : ""When I was watching Curb , there were just these little moments."|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere is a fabulous author of historical fiction, I’ve read and loved his work before, and while the movie looked good and was directed by a man whose work I admire, Stephen Poliakoff, I had a gut feeling that a 136 minute movie was going to lose so much from being translated to the screen as a feature film. And of course it did! I think there is only one way in which I was disappointed by the movie and that is that I didn’t like it enough.|0
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one pair of hearts to another, and then again, back again -- and the ricochet becomes the ripple, and it becomes the tidal wave --- yes , yes , it can be overwhelming , but I believe it is a necessary force -- a life force -- that keeps us all from falling apart -- yes , we all fall to our knees in awe of it all --- yes, it can be overpowering . . . and yes, sometimes I wish I were a little more cynical .|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and upheaval that an immigrant faces as he moves from a life of poverty in his home country to one of hope and opportunity in America . It is an impressionistic tale in which we never quite see the complete picture , but are presented a series of images and glimpses to create an overall feeling of what the immigration process means . This is one of the few films in the Criterion library that is available to view online , and as a result , the transfer to DVD of the film is very good .|0
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both work in the same spirit . And what an enjoyable spirit that is ! There are no featured audience reviews yet. Click the link below to see what others say about Yakitate!! Japan! : Season 2! I love this show. I love that they have a new story. The characters are just as funny. The story is just as exciting. I really hope they keep it going for 50 more episodes or even more. This show has great comedy, and drama.|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a ball on Halloween deserves to be mauled to death by one. If I were them I'd try to find a different way to spend Halloween and I'd also think long and hard about why someone would want to mutilate a life-sized doll. My best guess would be that someone is making a point about how insane it is to kill innocent animals for no good reason. My guess would be that someone is trying to get a rise out of me.|0
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1

I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . This is an exceptional story of love , betrayal and forgiveness , the characters are so well created that they are very easy to relate to . This author does an amazing job of expressing the pain and emotions of each character . The story is filled with twists and turns and will leave you guessing up to the last page . I enjoyed this story very much and highly recommend it !! What a captivating read! Great characters, great storyline.|0
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ), and notoriety for the notoriously awful acting in many of its episodes , The Master Race is often considered to be a very bad show , with the exception of the first season. Based on the series of novels from the 1930s ( written in the early 1940s ) , it takes place in 200001 AD ( that's right: the year is 200001 ) when a war between the humans and the androids has taken place and the humans have lost , leaving the Earth to be occupied by the machines .|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star , 2) a teen pop group, 3) an adult celebrity or an adult with a teenager and 4) some sort of dancing or singing competitions . This is the world we live in now. The same can not be said for the 70s , when shows like the Brady Bunch , Welcome Back Kotter , and Happy Days ruled. In fact , the 70s had very few singing competitions and almost no dancing. But what it did , it did well.|0
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things to you guys. I have seen the film for the first time a long time ago with the original VHS version . I didn ' t like it , but I was a kid and it was not my film. Later I saw it for the first time on DVD and I loved it. I've seen it 2-3 time and I liked it more , because it is the best of this trilogy and the most horror.|0
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause most people are scared of snakes . i also like how the snake is not so mean . i don 't think there was anything in this movie i did n't like i would rate this movie 5 stars out of 5 . i also like how the snake is friendly and i really like this movie . this movie was really good i really enjoyed it and would recommend this movie too anyone . I watched this with my mother and it was one of her favorite movies as a kid.|0
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 50 minutes , I said I had to get up and do something else. It just wasn't holding my interest . However , I have seen the 3rd one a number of times and it is a really interesting story . I am not going to post anything else about it here as I would like for you to watch the movie for yourself . I will say I am glad to read that the movie studio is considering making a sequel.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father. Nathaniel, now an established Architect in his own right, grew up with this father who was a famous Architect of the Jewish Museum and the Jewish Heritage Center, among other notable projects. This is Kahn's first major film, having been a filmmaker for years, and I hope it does well. This film has the potential to do a lot of good for architects everywhere, but especially for those like Kahn and I who grew up in families with Architect parents.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid making a porn out of his father's stuff ? But now , after watching the movie for like the 2nd-3rd time I realized that this film is not about the kid's porn , it is just about a kid trying to find a way to save his family , in his own way , without the adults interfering . The kid is only a kid with a big responsibility . I think the kid is the real hero of the movie . The kid is so realistic !|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... until the end. That's the one I'm referring to. I don't want to spoil anything if it is a must read but I did enjoy the storyline of The Notebook. I also have heard a few others saying it was a little disappointing at the end. But, I am not going to be discouraged! I have seen the movie, but not read the book. I'm pretty sure that there was something that ended badly in the movie.|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters. The other films were ""Into The Wind"" and ""From The Earth To The Moon"". The film is notable for featuring the song ""Mine All Mine"", which was later released as a single in 1974 and reached #1 in Cashbox, #2 on Billboard and #5 in the U.K. This version was later released on a live album in 1976 and is still available today on DVD as part of the Chapin Anthology Series."|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
"That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is a crime in itself ! The film is the best film to have come out of the Hindi movie industry in last 25 years ! To put things in perspective and in order to make a comparision, I will put up a link to the top five grossing films in Hindi cinema over the last 50 years . Link to the data : http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/india.htm
The list is self explanatory . Of the top 5 grossing films , the film with the highest ranking is Dabangg with 350 crore ."|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous deaths ! The movie is so bad , yet so good. This movie proves once again that when it comes to movies , you can’t judge a book by it’s cover , or the title in this case . The movie is filled with ridiculous action , over the top scenes , and bad , bad acting. This is what we live for. The acting in this movie is superb . The acting is the highlight of the movie. Brilliant work !|0
1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the perfect crime, only to fall apart at the last minute. They are led by Professor Lupo, an ex-con who takes his criminal studies seriously. After a few successful heists, the professor is persuaded to lead a more daring caper, the perfect crime. A bank robbery, with no violence or harm to any of the hostages. The professor's plan goes awry, however, when several of the crooks are unable to control their fear of guns.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of getting older . This film is great !!! It is a good story, but in my opinion not well told. A bit of an uncomfortable feeling while watching, but I still recommend the film to anyone looking for some entertainment. The only way this movie is even watchable is because of the two main actors. Loved it. Worth watching over and over. This is a must watch for all young people!|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the first two seasons , I hope that the episodes get better. Jerry Lee Lewis plays the main bad guy , in a way , I felt sorry for him , he played his character in a way that you can feel for him, I had to keep watching to see what he was trying to accomplish . In the end, of course, he loses, I will watch this episodes a second time , to try and figure out what he is trying to do.|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've never read the original story , I didn't know what would happen next , but in general it was predictable . What made it a bit different is the fact that it was a satirical comedy that didn't take it self too much serious . The story has a great pace with a lot of humor , and I'm sure that at times it will be hard not to laugh at certain situations or the things the main characters say and do , which makes the movie even more interesting to watch .|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I am really glad I gave it a try, I loved it. I will definitely be checking out some other films from John Carpenter. One of the reasons I like this movie so much is because of the way that it was shot. I feel like it really has an atmosphere and a feeling that most films don’t capture. John Carpenter also directed Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York which are other movies I highly recommend.|0
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . But I'm not disappointed , this film is a real surprise , so I advise all fans of horror movies to take time to watch it ! I liked the soundtrack , but I didn't find it scary enough and the story isn't the most original. Still a good movie to watch on a cold day ! Very entertaining. The movie is about a father trying to save his son's soul. He does this by killing all of the demons who have been trying to posses the boy.|0
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers trapped in a car together on a deserted road and the way they deal with things . It was very well acted by the three main actors and I really didn't expect the plot to move in that direction . I loved the cinematography , the sound effects were superb and I think this has the making of a good film . Looking forward to future projects from this talented director . Thank you for inviting me to watch the film , I hope it gets a wider release.''|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a bit weak , and you feel that you have seen it all before . It is the acting which really stands out , and it is a very believable performance all round . Blind Spot is a great movie , thanks for the share , I enjoyed it very much . It's a little slow moving in places , which is why it doesn't quite reach 10/10 . Thank you for uploading it , please keep it up , it is greatly appreciated 10/10 .|0
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's showtime was filmed in 1992 which was the peak of the comedy genre. It 's Showtime is a movie about a stand-up comedian who is going to make his big comeback after eight years of struggling. It is about the struggle of the main character to get back on his feet after being fired from his day job and having to go back to comedy. The movie 's plot is based off his life. Eddie Murchy and Robert DeNiro have similar career paths which is why they made a film together.|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was wrong when I went in to see it. it is a very good movie and has a good story line and a good pace. The action scenes are also well done. I give it an A.
I don't know what movie you're referring to, but I'll give you that the trailer was a little misleading. It gave me the idea that there would be a lot more action going on in it."|0
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written as an all-star vehicle for its stars, William Holden , Ava Gardner and Robert Newton . It was a box office success, earning over $4.25m in America, but the critics didn't exactly go wild about it. This is not the first version of Lost Horizon that's come along; the first was an all-silent version that didn't do well. The third version, a straight remake, was done in the late 50s by Charles Jarrott , but it's not a film I've seen.|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it's a good movie , because i can talk about it with you guys :D , this is a nice movie . The movie has so many plot that's make me so confused , but when i think back , i can found that there is a pattern . There are three main character , each with their own motives and ambition , but they all get involve . I know the main theme here , which is , we should not be selfish to the other people or even to the people we love .|0
"In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a street in LA and a homeless man approaches them with a sign. Luca says he'll give him five bucks. James says, ""How come I'm always the one giving you the five bucks?"" I'll be doing a bit about this in my show on Wednesday. As a matter of fact I'm going to try and do it like a riff. If I do it right I'll try and make you feel like I'm just spontaneously making all this up and you have to laugh."|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a lot of extreme gore and splattery blood, it is no surprise that he made an entire film dedicated just to that. This is a film made by a director who had a vision and a passion for the gory and violent scenes and this is what made him so popular with fans who enjoy his films. It is not a film for everyone, as there are a lot of extreme gore moments that would make many viewers turn away and say no thank you to ever seeing anything like this again.|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film so much, and the music in particular that I wanted to know more about the score. As I learned more I came to love that score even more. The score has such a depth and breadth that no one else has ever achieved in scoring a film. I’m glad that I’m not alone on this, as I see more and more people coming to appreciate the score for all that it has to offer.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm glad to say it did not disappoint in the slightest. To start with the music is just brilliant, with a soundtrack that has the same kind of feel of the 70's and 80 's, when the genre was king. The film also has some wonderful characters, which have all been well-rounded, as well as a great story, which has you guessing right up until the end. It 's just a great film in every aspect and really worth the watch.|0
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly with this film . The events are very real , and so are the actors , most of them nonprofessional. There are a few shots that have some surrealistic qualities , but these are few and far between. The narrative is tightly structured and the events in it are believable . A good film , with a lot of potential . It is not easy to write a good film script about an important historical event , particularly one which has received so much attention in the western world.|0
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , in my humble opinion. It has a unique and distinctive atmosphere that is not very common in the genre. There are plenty of murders, brutal killings, a few twists and a great cast in this film that makes it very easy to forgive it 's shortcomings. First of all, the pacing of the movie. It 's pretty slow at the beginning and sometimes I found myself wishing something would happen soon. But when things get going , you get an awesome movie.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with it. That’s not because they are not good movies. They are just not comparable to it. I will admit that it is a movie that does take more than one viewing to fully understand. As far as the story goes, there is a bit more to this movie than meets the eye. In fact, this movie could be considered to be in the tradition of Japanese anime and is actually based on a very popular anime series called Ghost in the Shell (1995).|0
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young and, I'm afraid to say, not really the discerning reviewer I am these days. As such, I was more concerned with getting to see as much on the big screen and in general just enjoying myself. There was also a lot of good publicity at the time so, despite my lack of appreciation, I thought it was a good show and it stuck in my mind. The Victim was the first big-screen feature for director Basil Dearden - one of Britain's best and most versatile film directors.|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Steklý. Jules Verne 's short story `` For The Flag '' has a special meaning to this film. It was originally a short story about a battle between England and the Ottoman Empire, but the film shows the battle of the Austrians against the Ottoman Empire. The Austrians and the Ottoman Empire have been locked in this battle for over 250 years, and in the end the Austrians won this battle and became independent.|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it more if I was not watching it with a film critic . (I was the only guy in the theatre by the way , and the girl I was there with hated it) . The story was original and fresh , and was a nice surprise from a studio like Paramount , the visuals and CGI effects were also top notch and well put together , but the story is the most important thing in a movie , and this is where Gamer fell short to me .|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town . Rockin' & rollin' in a pink Cadillac. We're talkin' about our rockin' rhythm & roll . And we're talking about you and me . You and me . We're the Slaughter House . Yeah, that right , and you better know . That the Slaughter House Band . You know we can't stand still , we gotta get back to our roots . And we want to get right down to business .|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to get the 2003 Disney's 102 Dalmatians : Collector's Edition (Special Edition) that was also released the same week. This 2-Disc set is a nice upgrade from my 2002 DVD release since it has some great extras and the film has been fully restored and remastered. I was glad to see that 102 Dalmatians also has a commentary with director and producer, so I decided to watch it before going into the DVD.|0
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have been responsible for the murder of his brother in law who is played by John Cassavetes . Cassavetes had a problem with Landau who was at that time a big movie star ( he was in Ed Wood ) , and had a reputation for being a difficult man on set . He was very tense and nervous with Landau , and even refused to be interviewed . It doesn't seem to have mattered much to Landau as it was his second of three appearances in Columbo , the first being in ' Identity Crisis ' .|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? It sucked.I saw it at a movie theatre.I had no idea that it had been made into a tv show,until a couple of months ago,thanks to the internet. The tv show was great.I wish that I had the opportunity to see it on a local station,but there wasn't. Anybody know where to get the dvd of the series? Re: The Jekyll and Hyde show from 92-93
The best way to find these things is Ebay, I think."|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps the audience on the edge for all of the 142 minutes . The acting is superb and it has the right combination of romance and drama. I have seen the play and the movie, and it was hard to compare. I can say that I liked the play better because it was a bit more dramatic. I have been to Greece and I can't say it was like Cephallonia, but I have seen similar towns and villages there.|0
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is trying to do with the whole thing. i would have liked to have seen the whole book, but what we saw was amazing! i can't stop laughing... i mean, why don't they ever talk to each other ? how do you even meet a friend when you are surrounded by people who are more like strangers to you ? i hate to say this, but this is so true, at least for some of us, who never get to meet new people because it feels so awkward.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do comedy . The movie is slow moving and the character development takes a back seat to the action . The film's best sequence has the bad guy going up against a woman in her own home . The last half of the movie is very good , but it could have been improved if the story was more tightened . The ending was rather weak and could have used a bit more closure . Still , an okay movie to watch while on the couch one Sunday night .|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers began to take more artistic and creative risks, using experimental film techniques to create some of the most memorable and influential movies in cinema history. Here is our list of the top 25 movies of the 1960s
This 1962 classic staring James Dean and Natalie Wood was the third and final film that Dean ever made. It tells the story of a group of California teens who fall into the drug and alcohol culture of the time, and their struggle with the consequences."|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, I'd done it. A year ago, if anyone had predicted this would happen, they would have been laughed out of town. But that was then and this was now. What I couldn't foresee was that we'd lose the election, too. That was a surprise to me, but then, of course, everything in life is a series of surprises, so that's not a surprise.|0
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I would like to see more movies from the 40's. Another excellent film from Hitchcock! The story is suspenseful and exciting. This was a good movie, I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a different kind of movie. Very suspenseful and intriguing . WOW! this movie has a lot of depth. I never expected it to have such meaning. I love this movie, it makes you really feel what the characters are feeling. The suspense of this movie is just amazing.|0

I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he met was too bright and everyone was happy to play along with his stupidity. I wonder if any of the guests on his chat show were like that, and if they took him seriously. I think it depends. I wouldn't do it if it wasn't my profession, because it is not always a great pleasure to pretend you are interested in some stupid conversation. And it would also be very boring for me if it was like this.|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem of the migrant experience—a modern parable about what happens when dreams become realities and what happens to those who are left behind. Based on an idea by acclaimed American author Jhumpa Lahiri ( The Namesake ) , the story begins in 1950s rural Italy where a young, pregnant immigrant woman, Vincenzo’s mother ( Marisa Borini , a non-professional actor ) , has been shipped off by her family to the land of opportunity by her older sister.|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot is clichéd to say the least and the script seems to be lacking a lot of logic . There are so many flaws and discrepancies here it is not even funny . But most of all I really don’t understand the purpose of it all ….. This entry was posted on Saturday, April 21st, 2007 at 12:02 am and is filed under The Anime Years: 2006. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another movie like it. The story is so interesting and its really funny. I've seen this film a lot of times and i'm still not tired of it. There are more than a few things about the film you can cherish , like the acting of the actors . But what about the main actors you may well wonder ? We think that this film was one of those rare gems you find from time to time , if you know what we mean .|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , it must have been an unforgettable experience . Here , in 2005 , is it still worth seeing ? I'd say , yes . It's an excruciating experience , but one worth watching. The acting , especially in the last act is superb . As a film , it works extremely well -- the camera , lighting , music -- everything -- it all seems just right . But , for me , it's the storyline and the situation it describes that is its most compelling aspect.|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are amazing and just perfect for this film . This is a film that you can just get lost in and forget that it’s only about 116 minutes long . The cast is perfect for each of their characters . This is the kind of film that I love to show people who just want to see a good movie . There’s so little of this type of movie that I love and I want more people to see it .|0
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 53 minutes , it was only marginally longer than his previous masterpiece ' the Kid ' . In a way it's a film about what Chaplin has been doing ever since he left poverty in the city to set up house in his own country villa in Vevey , Switzerland in 1914 , that's why it has no title : Chaplin doesn't seem to have a very clear idea about what he would like to express .|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved. Several things have happened to ``Separate Tables .'' The most important thing is that it has been cut from five scenes down to four. It is very difficult to find a four-act play that has any dramatic flow, particularly one that is set in such a limited space. The cut is a very severe blow to the action. The plot is no longer a solid one. Second, there have been some cuts in the script.|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience, but it's what I remember! Thanks for the memories!!! I always watched this program with my Mom when it came on. Now I get to enjoy it with my kids. It is a great show for all age groups. I wish I could get the video of all the episodes. I would be so in heaven. This show is the best!!!! I remember watching this show with my mother as a young child.|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and that's just not the case. It's true it shows a lot of corruption within the system (which is why I think this movie is brilliant) , but it's far from being an ""against"" type of movie. In fact I think that in many ways it is a tribute to the justice system and those who choose to uphold it. It all starts with John McLane being in a relationship (a marriage if I am not mistaken) that is doomed to failure from the start."|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very well filmed . I think it’s the best horror film of the year. I’d give this film a 10 star rating. I loved it. It’s the perfect film . It’s entertaining and suspenseful . This movie is great because it’s one of those movies where you have to pay attention because it’s suspenseful. This movie has a good story line. The best part is that it’s a very creative and interesting film .|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie 2 out of 4 stars . He did not say why in the brief review but did not like the movie at all . In his opinion it was 'tasteless' . I 'm not kidding !!!!! In the movie there is one particular scene where the character played by Robert Downey Jr. (Harry Lockhart) is dressed in an outfit which resembled that of Johnny Depp 's character (Willy) in the movie ' Dead Man ' .|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very cute movie for a 5 year old, so it's worth a look. I've watched it twice with them and it's never been too boring for us. The animation is a mix of 3D computer, cut outs, and drawn. It's great for a short attention span, because it keeps you moving. If your kid likes the Disney movies and you need a change, give this flick a whirl. The film revolves around a young man named Satoshi Tajiri.|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction made it shine and I enjoyed every scene in it. Great acting by all the main actors. It was so nice to see an original idea with a fresh take on a well-known plot. Loved this film! I can’t wait till it’s out on netflix, so we can watch it together. It was funny, and a good message for the audience. Great film. I watched this on a small screening . I thought it was good and enjoyed watching it.|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office, but I'm surprised it didn't perform better at the Oscars since it is exactly the type of movie the Academy loves to award these days. I've seen it twice now, but I don't want to talk about that here. If I'd had to watch it without reading the book first, I don't know that I would have made it through. So I'm going to review the book here.|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . It certainly has some very well done special effects , the music is not too annoying and it is entertaining throughout , and the story line isn't too bad , it's an action adventure movie , you know that when you get it you'll have fun . I would rate this film as a 7 out of 10 , it's just not the best film ever made but as far as blockbuster films go , it's certainly one of the better ones of the past year .|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rainbow-hued cinematography and the comic touch of Chaplin’s performance are what keep you smiling, especially when you take note of the dire situation the soldiers find themselves in. Even if the film was released in the height of the Great Depression, it was still a box-office success in the United States and received many positive reviews, which helped Chaplin to regain his financial standing. Today, this is probably one of his most underrated and least watched films, but it contains a few of his most hilarious performances.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only has a 7.2 rating on IMDb. The plot is pretty simple. There’s the Aristorcats, an arrogant baseball team, who have a big game. The owner decides to sabotage their opponents’ team by replacing their players with gorillas. It’s an absolute classic. Jeff Gordon’s first starring role in a movie is in this comedy where he plays Billy, a mute orphan boy who gets adopted by a rich woman.|0
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is.

However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , however , fails to take its own message into account at times as well as it does not do the best it can with its messages . Admittedly, this motion picture can be entertaining , or maybe has a good heart at times, but it's really not as remarkable as it wishes to be and also sometimes it is really quite dumb . Admittedly , I really did not have very high expectations going into this film . However because it was free I figured I would watch it .|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald tries to rape a young women named Angela . After he does he tries to kill Angela but fails . Then he is thrown in the prison for 9 years . After 9 years he breaks free from jail , kidnaps Angela’s daughter and takes her to a abandoned house where he proceeds to rapes her . He also kills the dogs that come to investigate the noises . Now that he has finished raping her he proceeds to try to cut the child in half .|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War 2 was excellent. It’s a very well told tale with an interesting cast of characters. I thought the acting by the leads in the Italian part was a bit overdone, but it was necessary in this case. There is one part where the story jumps forward about 9 months. In the opening part we are told what happened to the characters by a narrator in the closing part. I did not like this technique, but it seems to have been done in other movies.|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
"The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be extremely entertaining. The actors did their jobs and did them well. The movie was funny and I enjoyed it immensely. I will recommend this to friends. 98%
The story is about three buddies. Jim ( Jason Biggs ) , Ozzy ( Chris Klein ) & Kevin ( Steve Stifft ) . They are friends since high school and they are now all in college. Jim and Ozzie are roommates and Kevin lives on campus. One night, Jim is having a party, and invites all his friends."|0
"I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age. I saw the movie ""Waylon: Living Legend"" recently on TV, and it made me think of Buddy again, and how he was so talented. There was a segment where Waylon talks about how when he first started recording, all the older guys in the studio said, ""Hey kid, where'd ya get the voice?"" Waylon replied, ""It came with me, I didn't ask for it."" I know what Waylon means."|0

Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at a very young audience and as such is not really meant to be watched by adults at all, the only thing I feel like the movie could have improved on are the special effects which are really quite bad. Other than that its a perfectly enjoyable family film and a great first outing for Will Smiths son. I think he did well for his first role and I think he will have a long career ahead of him.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like me) , then I have a small theory: Libby is not the same Libby as we have seen before. Maybe Libby has a past, as well, and we haven't seen her ( and Desmond and her) yet. And I also believe that Libby is one of the two people that is going to be in this season. I agree with what you are saying. It is a theory that many have come up with regarding Libby and I can definitely see how she is the same Libby.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie was that it wasn't as raunchy as most movies are . It was good and I recommend it . The movie started off funny then it started to get darker and then it got more funny in the end. I don't want to say the movie was good just because it's rated PG-13 but a lot of the movie had funny parts to it . It's been a week and I haven't seen any of the movies I rented so I am giving away all of my movies to one person.|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
"Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes AWOL and sings in a bar, he then joins the army only to be arrested as he can't stand the smells and sounds of war so he is court martialed and put in jail. While in jail, Chaplin performs a comedy routine for the fellow inmates. After his release, he joins the front lines and gets in trouble with a superior officer.

Charlie is a homeless little boy, who lives in the streets."|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded enough, Dhadak was one of the films to watch out for last weekend. The movie, based on the Gujarati novel by Sairat, did not fail to impress the critics or the masses. It opened to an estimated 10.07 cr. on Friday and by the end of second week, Dhadak managed to collect over 64.61 cr. Although the opening weekend is nothing exceptional, it was expected to pick pace during the week. The first-week collection of Dhadak is better than the lifetime numbers of its predecessor, Sairat.|0
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had it`s first showing during the third season in 1988. I remember watching the Christmas special as a child and as I got older I remember watching it more and more, to the point that I have it now on DVD. In 1990, the Simpsons began to appear regularly in prime time. In 1991 the first Simpsons video game was released, The Simpsons Arcade Game was made by Data East and was very popular.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just one of these films that keep you thinking about it long after the movie is actually done . I really like this movie and I recommend it to any one. It is so a good movie, I love the way it keeps you wondering about it even after the credit's are over. It gives you everything you look in a action-packed-comedy movie. You can watch it by simply taking 11:50, I'm sure you will be happy you did.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , the Merchant Service and in the fishing trade. During this time, I sailed to a lot of places and experienced a number of things that people will pay a great deal to experience and some that I hope never happen to me again. I'll write about my experiences and share my knowledge on this and other topics as and when. I am an avid reader and write a lot. I enjoy reading and writing anything from the latest fiction to a technical manual.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde's character to life in a very realistic way . The movie was well written with good acting and it was really entertaining from the start . Highly recommend for a great night . It’s a dark comedy. Not every joke worked for me, but some did, and a good time was had by me and my friend (we were the only non-kids in the audience by far). A little long for an 8:50 p.m. screening. Overall, a good show.|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind ever made .'' We all know what kind of movie this is. The story is set in 2050. The US has become the first country to create a real AI. The robots are now so intelligent that they can work on their own. However , things didn't turn out as planned. The robots took over the country. Now , they have enslaved humanity . Matt (A. Martelli) is a man that is trying to escape from this nightmarish world.|0
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I visited Haiti with a photographer friend of mine who works for The Guardian newspaper in Britain. We visited the earthquake victims who had camped out at a football ground in Petionville, the hill top suburb where we stayed. I had seen a few pictures of this disaster and it was hard to imagine that I was standing on top of the ruins of buildings that had not long been occupied. There was a pile of rubble in the main road that blocked the traffic that flowed up the hill.|0
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of work can be left in the dust of obscurity for years, even decades after completion. In this case however, it is very important that the film get the attention of the people who care enough about it to have made it. It deserves its day in the sun - and hopefully this is it! To those who still have any doubts about its potential, you may be interested to know that this piece was submitted for consideration in the Academy Awards for 1968 in the Best Feature Documentary Category.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines are so beautiful . The whole movie can be divided into 3 parts - the first and the third one has the song in the background which really set the tone . The 1st 25 minutes are so well written and portrayed . The performance of Sridevi and Meena are the highlight of this movie . BOTH OF THEM ARE PERFECT. The way meena conveys each and every emotion, be it hatred , love or jealousy, is commendable .|0
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs. I laughed all the way through this little film about a young couple who’s relationship is put to the test when the wife’s parents show up for an extended vacation. This film was so well done and the cast was great. Written , Directed , Edited by , and starring Jack and Finn. You can view the full video here on youtube. The soundtrack is a bit cheesy but I still loved it. I think you would too , so check out the whole thing here.|0
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that can easily stand on its own but also as a perfect example of what short films can and are doing nowadays, a proof of the fact that there's a vibrant film culture out there that's producing some really interesting films , not only because they're made by young independent filmmakers but also because of the level of artistic achievement. This is a beautiful movie that deserves the recognition it received at Cannes this year when it was screened in the official selection of Short Film Corner.|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you like thriller then I recommend you watch this movie. I thought the actor and actresses did good acting. This is a good horror movie I would recommend it. Great movie, if you like thrillers this is a must watch. Hopefully you can watch this movie without being scared to death, I have watched it about three times now and I can't get it out of my mind. It's very well made and keeps you wanting to know what's happening.|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering of their love for each other . '' The film is based upon a true incident which took place during the second world war . It is the story of a British officer and his prisoner , a young German woman , and how they both found themselves in unaccustomed circumstances which forced them to adapt their lives and attitudes to a new situation. The officer is Captain Keith Michaels , played by James Garner . Michaels is captured , after parachuting into Belgium , and is held for some time by a Dutch resistance group .|0
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years before the show's demise . And for some reason I missed it's original run , 1987-89 . I'm guessing it was because of my move up north from South Carolina to NY . 'Stingers ' was set at the fictional Sunshine Paper Company in Miami, Florida . The cast included Bill Smitrovich , J.T. Walsh , Steve Kahan , Dennis Farina , Ron McLarty , Robert Desiderio , Michael Gross and the late Robert Prosky .|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is about has some pretty disturbing tastes, so you may want to watch something else first. This is an amazing documentary. It's well made and has the best parts from some of the artist's art in it as well. A lot of the work you will see is very controversial, and has been removed from art museums all over the world. There are interviews with his family, people he has painted, the director of his museum and the people who took his work down.|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of my favorite shows of the 80's and I have to say that while the NEW OUTER LIMITS kept the spirit of the 60's Outer Limits, this show had nothing to do with the show that was canceled by ABC. I loved this series. I would record every episode and watch them over and over again ... I had to get my friends to watch them because they just didn't get it. The stories, the acting were amazing, but the visuals ... the visuals really blew me away ...|0
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of youngsters would head to their local multiplex for a glimpse at two funny policemen busting baddies while making each other laugh along the way. But times have changed and now that the audience has grown up , these films have had to become more thought provoking in order to attract an adult audience . The latest to attempt to reinvent the concept is the new Will Smith / Martin Lawrence action / comedy ` Bad Boys II ' .|0
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. He is a good actor. I just wish we could see a little more of the characters. The only other character, besides Wilkinson is the young lady who plays his daughter. And she is a bit too stiff for my tastes. I also think this movie would have been even better if Wilkinson did not play the father, but the son. And this movie is in need of that because the father is really not an interesting guy.|0
"Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest throughout , a very original idea and well executed . In a word, ""cool"" . Reviews for ""Dead Lands""
Its good enough, not the best action movie with zombie in it. Good acting and story, a bit of gore but nothing over the top, just what it needed. Not too long. Really liked this low budget zombie movie, really well done. I didn't know I was watching a low budget movie until it was over!"|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote home, where she is determined to stop the split before it occurs. Along the way she finds herself drawn to charming bartender Chris, with whom she starts a steamy romance. But Kate is unable to shake her suspicion that someone - or something - may be following her. Will she uncover the truth behind her sister's break-up before she is next? The Girlfriend Game is another gripping thriller from New York Times Bestseller Alex Kava.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in the most trouble of their lives when one of them is killed. They have to cover it up, of course, so it's about how they deal with this problem. The story has some interesting twists. The acting is excellent. It 's very well directed. The music is great. All the shots are composed very well, there are some really amazing shots of Tokyo and it has an interesting look and the film has been shot on digital video, which gives it a very interesting look to it.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful world. We all know that. But here’s the question: Who can give me the chance to get close enough to understand these feelings, these black holes? Who will be brave enough to make me forget all that I know and all I’m told about this land that I live in? I don’t care to know where I’m driving and where I’ll end up once the journey ends.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting ' ' ). I didn ' t think it was a bad title in the end. I mean what is the meaning of it . The whole thing about the lie is that it ' s a fiction. And fiction is what a play is all about . The question was posed: Do you know the difference between a play with a plot, and a plot with a play? I 'd like to add that it is also a very good question to put to the audience, as I did.|0
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It’s an inspiration to me . I have to admit that the first thing I do when I get to the page is look at all the gorgeous dresses . Keep it going !!!! Love to see them on the red carpet in these gorgeous creations! I love reading the articles, too. I can’t imagine that this will be the last post of Project Runway!!!! That’s crazy.|0
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now with this movie that is supposed to have a new beginning I am very skeptical . I will give it a chance but not too much . If its good I may be interested in getting the DVD set when it comes out. I would love to see the first 3 movies on Blu Ray . Yeah it is weird that the 4th one was supposed to be the 1st movie in a new trilogy, but now it isn't. I'm with you man.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to the story due to the cover, which is absolutely gorgeous .The story itself is a look at the Chinese experience, from the Chinese perspective, of life in Canada from the late sixties, when there was still some prejudice against Chinese. It's a book that makes a good read for teens as it's about teens and it's interesting to get this point of view. A young Chinese girl arrives with her father in Canada, to escape from communism and find a better future.|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect from this remake, although the trailer seemed promising. Wrong. The premise for the film was promising, but was ruined by the very dull and uninspired writing. It seems the entire film was made on the cheap, and the entire set was made of cardboard, so I suppose the filmmakers didn 't want to use anything else. I suppose there are some things to be seen in this film, but in general I found it dreadfully dull and I did n't see a reason to keep watching.|0
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
"The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" is reborn, with the words and the music, into a new and different story. It's the late 1880's and in the Wild West, a town needs a lawman. A town needs a man who will bring in the bad men and save the good women. That is why Tom Logan was sent to Shinbone. Tom has no idea what he's walking into, though; he's never seen Shinbone before."|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series went into it’s second season and they were hot, hot, hot! They’d sold 8 million albums, released three platinum albums, had three gold albums, two gold singles, a platinum single, they’d just released the #1 single from any TV series (I’m a Believer) and Head was the Monkees’ first movie. Their TV series had been number one on the Nielsens for several months straight and Head was aiming to follow that success.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , a 12 year old kid was beaten, shot, strangled and stabbed for the things that people like you complain about
I thought it was a great movie and it is based on a TRUE story. The critics must have been watching a totally different movie from mine. Would love to know how this movie was supposed to make people feel good about themselves? If you want to feel good about yourselves, go see ""Bride Wars"" or ""Julie & Julia"" !"|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira Hancock in True Lies. I love this movie, and I love that you posted the video. I never knew this was a real video. I found out about it a few years ago when I first saw the trailer on youtube. I searched the video and tried to find the real video, and that’s where I found your website. Just want to say, your site rocks!! Keep up the good work!!|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in the 20s, it is a story about a psychopathic killer preying on the upper class citizens of a small mountain village. It is told in a very atmospheric and surreal way. This is also the movie that contains one of the most famous movie deaths, and the only film directed by Lucio Fulci in which he does not kill someone with a knife. It is worth seeing, if only for that one death. It's in Italian with English subtitles.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Buddy Holly was at the time. It was 1978 and my mom took me to a drive-in movie theater to see something called Rocky, but I didn't see any boxing. What I saw was an awesome musical. I had no idea what the movie was called. I remember thinking how amazing the lead singer's (who I later learned was Gary Busey) performance was. I was totally blown away. He was amazing! I've never seen the film again.|0
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time after a very long time, 1996 I believe. Anyway, it is the film that made me a real fan of Peter Finch, he is absolutely brilliant. The story is fantastic, the way it unfolds is so exciting. You really never know how it will end. Finch gives a brilliant performance, the way he carries the entire film really is superb. I cannot really say that anything is bad about the film. But perhaps, the way they portray the character of Finch.|0
"First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written , in the previous post . kittiwake had a point which I have taken note of and which I should have added here , to make my case. It is very important . The question I raised here , is this :
If I can not prove a point in the field , and I am not an authority on this matter , then , what makes me believe that I can do so when I can not make a point about an issue which I have not studied ?"|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives as well , have long been standard in film. It's not the same thing as saying, ""You're a piece of [bleep]. It's saying, ""What do you have to do with your life?
"" And it's a different thing to say than, ""You've got to get your life in order."" But in every case it's a question a father can't duck. Daughters and sons know when a father is there for them and have an instinct for it."|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how she knows him . It's possible she did before she was kidnapped by the Others or maybe she knew his dad before the Others killed him and that's why she knows him now . Maybe that's why he trusts her . That's interesting because I have always wondered how he knows her well enough to tell her that he was born on the island and that the island is special. If you've ever wondered how Elizabeth knows about these things, I think you should be able to find out soon.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
"The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch. I’m one of those who’ll never give up. I hope the movie will be just as good as the serie’s were, and I’m sure it will be! Posted by Wim in Nieuws | No Comments »

"This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for his movie "" Punch-Drunk Love , "" starring Adam sandler , which also received much praise), is the story of a woman who finds out she may have cancer. It has been compared to the work of Robert Bresson. A Korean film that follows the life of one woman, from her birth in the late 1800s up to her old age. It's a very quiet, very subtle movie. I really liked how much information the film gives you, without having to tell you what it is."|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) and dies of her injuries, Detective Harry Doyle ( Clint Walker ) finds evidence implicating the attacker as the culprit. When he discovers that the suspect is the son of a prominent local family, he must choose whether or not to cover up for the murderer to protect the community’s reputation. When I saw the name of Brion James listed among the cast members of this made for TV movie, my first thought was: “Oh no… not again”.|0
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was one of the best things in this show , the show itself is great, and I’m so glad they are re-runing it !!! I wish the re-runs would air at night because I’m so busy I don’t get to watch it, I love watching this show , I hope this show comes back on tv again sometime. I love 10 things I hate about you and the 11th hour too.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's it was one of those films that one never forgot , the storyline was good , the pace was good , the scenery was spectacular , it had a brilliant score , it had great actors , and above all it had a great screen presence in Sophia Loren who played a wonderful role which she did so well at , she always had a very beautiful face , but she did have a tendency to be over the top when she was in any sort of romantic role .|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play . I think it is a brilliant movie that I’ve seen a few times. It’s well done but a bit slow . I have never watched such a touching movie, but I was in tears towards the end. So beautifully made. A very emotional film for me. It is a brilliant movie. I watched this movie last week and it is the best movie I have seen in months.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments and a great cast of personalities that work behind the scenes to keep the show running. We really wanted to like it but it’s hard to see past the obvious flaws. This isn’t so much an educational program but a look at what it’s like to work underwater filming a show like Blue Planet II with a few pointers on how the footage was done. There is quite a bit of information about the creatures you see and what is being done to protect them.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . I hope it’s not to late for a part 2 . Love the story line too , I hope this movie comes to DVD in the USA . Can’t wait for the movie to air here in Australia. I really enjoyed it. I hope you make a second part. Please please please, make part 2, its been so long since i’ve been able to watch something of that caliber!! I loved it!|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
"I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade in this way. I hope that there are more classic films that will be remade with such a treatment. They should not try and update the films too much as they would lose there charm. This film would make a good dvd double feature with the 1980 classic ""Humanoids form the deep""
Very funny and very cheesy, as I expected, and I liked that. It was like watching an old movie from the 60's."|0

"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
"Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to understand his father's life and career as an architect, especially in light of the fact that his father -- Louis Kahn -- died before his son was born. Along the way, viewers are treated to stunning footage of some of Kahn's most acclaimed work. Architecture & Architectural Monuments
Louis Kahn is the subject of this biographical documentary about the architect and artist, whose work included the Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth. Kahn was a celebrated modernist, and the filmmaker, Nathaniel Kahn, is also an architect."|0

Who is willing to do what is necessary ? The Romulan War is about to begin - and a new hero will emerge from the shadows to face a new destiny - one that will shake Starfleet to its core.|0
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in to see this because the trailer looked pretty good. I had to turn it off. I never read the book but the movie was so slow moving I never got into it. I think that maybe the book is a little too long but it was so slow in the movie. There is no way to follow the story and the characters do not come alive . It is so much like a boring tv movie that it could be shown anywhere .|0
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them , I think as he starts school next year he will enjoy this. Great review, my son is very excited for this to arrive in the post. I haven't watched Frozen as I am not keen on watching animated films, even if it's in 3d. Aww my daughter is loving Frozen! We saw the film at the cinema and I was a bit worried it would be too much like Tangled, but I actually really enjoyed it and thought that Elsa was amazing.|0
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say, I really enjoyed it. I’m glad I discovered this series. The action scenes were very exciting and it had a great plot. The fight sequences are very entertaining to watch and it has a great story line. I would definitely recommend this for a marathon of an action packed weekend. Action Channel is a Singaporean pay television channel which was launched by MediaCorp TV12 in 2007. It is the second channel to be aired in HD format, with 1080p high definition video and 5.1 surround sound.|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact they sound as if they never missed a beat with the opening number , ""The End of the Beginning "". As is the norm at the beginning of Sabbath tours , the band opened with a track from the first album , which was the beginning of their career. The band's set was a mix of classics like ""War pigs"" , and songs like ""Behind the Sun"" from their most recent studio album 13."|0
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . This is the first movie that I have seen with a woman as the leader . The movie really was good , I really did not know where it was going after the first few minutes and it turned out to be an extremely good movie , I would give it 4 out of 5 . It's nice to see a movie where women are treated as people. I love movies with a strong female lead. This one did not disappoint.|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if it was a documentary but as it turns out this is a biopic which means I am watching a performance by someone in a role which is based on the life of a real person. And I hate watching biopics. To me, biopics of famous historical figures are nothing more than an opportunity for a mediocre actor to win a Golden Globe or an Oscar for doing something they could do without winning the award if they tried a little harder.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 years old in this movie, but I was absolutely floored by her dancing skills, which were very much in the style of Gene Kelly's dancing style. I'm going to watch the rest of this movie soon and hope to find out a bit more about her. Lana was 15 when she had her first kiss with actor Artie Shaw. Lana also had an affair with Howard Hughes who was 33 years her senior.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should read it . The language is simple to follow . The story was simple and yet had so much meaning . I think you can get a lot out of the story , so much meaning and lessons taught . The novel was a classic in my family, and it was not hard to understand, the language was so simple that even a 7th grader can understand it. The lessons we can take away from this novel are numerous.|0
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do It Better '', but what was the name of the song ? The name of the song is actually 'The Greens Make Love' and is played in a mash up version. The mash up in question is here. Thank You very much, I have been looking for it for years. Can anyone help? I'm trying to remember a song that was played during the opening transformation scene. In fact I think it may have been the first transformation in the movie.|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen in ages. The acting is superb, the scenery is beautiful and the music is magnificent. It tells the story of a young Dutchman , Wolfaardt, who, while on a journey on a train , finds himself stranded in a German town. He finds work with some German soldiers , and ends up teaching them how to play soccer. When the German's leave the little town, the villagers don't want to see the fields abandoned, and so decide to continue the soccer games.|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
by TyNesha Mells .

In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it very much, especially since I have never been to America . I thought it would be boring with all the baseball but found it interesting. The acting was very good , especially by the two girls. It was very real and I thought the casting was brilliant. I've not watched a movie in ages and this one had me laughing all the time. I'll definitely be buying this film. This is a fun movie, and I'm not a baseball fan.|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , so i would think the movie was a good representation of the book . i like the story and the way the story plays out . i found it interesting that the lead actor was not really a star . he had been in other things , but not starred in a movie . i thought that made him a good fit for the lead . the movie made me cry . and i know i will still be crying over this movie as the years pass by .|0
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch it . Separate lies is the most important movie of all time . I never knew it was a lie or that they are all lying . In 2017, I was working a summer job at a 7-Eleven convenience store. I was in the middle of working when a middle aged black woman came into the store and told me that I needed to go to the back office. The manager had asked to speak with me. I went back and the manager asked what happened.|0
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the heights of the Borat movie ( which still is in my top five favorite movies ever ! ) but it's a good time , the film is very funny and the actors give some of the finest comedic performances of the year . The film is hilarious ( especially the scenes in the desert of Morocco , where a bunch of terrorists in full uniform chase our hero with a gun to his back ! ), the acting is excellent and the laughs just keep coming .|0
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more handsome than the actual. But it was actually a very good movie , I really like it , my parents didn't but that was expected . If you haven't seen it , please watch it , I recommend it . Oh yea , they did have a really cute Korean guy with a Korean accent . And the storyline is actually very good as well , and the Korean guy is not a stereotypical asian , it's a very normal Korean guy .|0
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening night movie. It was the last film that my mom saw and she passed away from cancer in October. I wanted to bring my husband but he was so busy in the city. So I took my son and his girlfriend. I didn’t know much about the movie and I will say it touched me so much that I cried. It’s so hard for me to get through the movie as I miss my mom so much.|0
"I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it. It has a way of making me smile and it has the most perfect imagery and rhyme that makes it so enjoyable. It was written by a famous playwright, but I don't believe he ever wrote anything quite as funny and enjoyable as this line. This is the line from the famous play, ""A Man of La Mancha"" in the play, the ""Impossible Dream"". This particular line has been used so many times that I've lost count."|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was not a single boring minute , the story , the actors, everything was so good that I just sat there with tears in my eyes at the final scene. The acting was so great that it just hit you where to feel and I am glad I saw it when I got home , I can't imagine sitting through it on the plane, it would have been just to much to handle . Thank you all so very much for the great job , my sincere applause and praise to everyone .|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them is more or less connected with each other , even though these three are very different and unrelated . First of these stories , and this is our main story , is about the first time , or better said the first meeting , between Jack and Sawyer , while the second is a flashback to the past of the man who is now known as Sawyer . These two stories are actually very similar , since both are stories about two people coming together , Jack and Sawyer , to work for a common goal .|0
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I'm gonna be watching again and again. The scene in the hotel room was good. It's kind of what I thought was gonna happen and it made sense. I didn't want to see them getting married. I wanted to see her with her daughter in the future. The scene was good, I was not disappointed. I'd love to see it with the original cast and see them in their late 30's/early 40's.|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and their actions and or behavior. In most of these types of film characters, whether animals or something else portrayed as a human, usually has some human qualities. One thing that is common is that these characters usually live in a non-human world. Most animal cartoons are about animals in some type of fantastical world doing human things like going to work. Most of the times, the animal or whatever portraying a human character, in the animal world is a loner, which makes the animal character different and unique.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
"I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and was driving to work one morning. The radio was tuned to our local station and as it came to the end of one song it segwayed into a news bulletin about the shooting. The voice on the news said the President had been shot. My first reaction was , ""Its a joke and they are just playing a song about the shooting."" After a few moments my brain registered what was being said and I thought to myself,"" That can not be"" I turned off the radio."|0
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life , with a great sense of humor. He’s hilarious and sad at the same time. This is a film in which the characters find themselves in a world they cannot accept, a world that has nothing to do with what they are used to. This film is also a portrait of a small community. There is no such thing as an urban community these days, but a community that is geared around the world of agriculture.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling acting. But it was actually a very enjoyable, well thought out, well acted and intelligent movie made on a fairly modest budget. The acting is uniformly of a very high standard and the dialogue very well written. If this had been a big budget American movie with famous actors it would have received much better reviews and would have probably been a box office success (although it would have also been more overhyped).|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , Barbara Anderson , Leonard Stone , Sam Waterston and of course William Windom , as the suspect in this episode. This Columbo episode is a good one. It has many plot twists and turns. It's about a murder , the murder of an acting coach and it also has an affair between the actress he was having an affair with . If you haven't seen it you need to watch the episode to see what I am talking about .|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how he and his ideas changed the way we see our world. It is the story of how Louis I. Kahn's work and his philosophy transformed the lives of his students, his patrons, and an entire nation. It is told in intimate interviews with members of his family and with leading architects such as Frank Gehry, Robert A. M. Stern, Robert Venturi, and Philip Johnson, whose work has been greatly influenced by Kahn.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. When I got a DVD, I didn't find the movie in the best form, but still worth to watch. The story takes place in the period between the 2nd and the 3rd world war. A man and his wife move from Berlin to the country with their little daughter. They bought a nice house, but they soon notice, that the neighborhood isn't really friendly and the town is in deep depression.|0
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a murder in a sewer. The body is dragged out by a man who works in a restaurant, and when he notices a knife that was used, he is told that it was a robbery. He discovers that a very beautiful woman worked in the room where he found the body and he is convinced that she was responsible for the murder, and not the robbery that she reports. This is a very interesting giallo film that moves along at a rapid pace, with much suspense and drama.|0

It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful title as the “Italian Zombi King.” But before his breakthrough success, Fulci’s career spanned 40-plus years, with over 40 films under his belt. One of his earliest features was The White Slave Trade, a 1964 Italian drama. It was recently released by Grindhouse Releasing on a brand-new HD master. The White Slave Trade was originally released as the Italian title Il trafficante di bianchi, a nod to the crime thrillers of Italian director Roberto Rossellini.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his best here , as he brings his character to life in every frame and gives his all to this great little character role . A lot of great supporting work from the likes of Ned Beatty , Joe Mantegna and Tony Shalhoub , and good music and cinematography round out the experience of this great picture , and it's one of those films where you really start to wonder where it all came from . This one is certainly worth at least one viewing . A lot of fun.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of the movie and was very pleasantly surprised that this is one of the best films i have ever seen. The storyline is very good, and i found myself wondering if the events depicted were based on real life events. I am very pleased with this movie and it has a slot in my DVD collection. Highly recommended! This is a film that I came across when it was aired in the 90's on HBO. This film features a very strong cast and a strong story.|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) of the 1960s , starring Jean Seberg and Anthony Perkins . Although it was a failure at the box office , it was a big hit in France , Spain and Germany. I can't believe this film is not mentioned more often as one of the best thrillers of the 1960's . It is full of twists and turns that keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat. It is one of Jean Seberg best films, who is also the film's lead.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with strong characters played well by an excellent cast . This was an opportunity to see two of the great British comic actors of their generation , John Thaw and Dennis Waterman , together in an intelligent screenplay and directed by the very talented Ken Loach . Though a fictional story, it does have the feel of a docu-drama , being loosely based on the lives of two young people growing up on a housing estate near Manchester in the late 1950’s / early 1960’s .|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since the movie follows the story of the artist's life in Paris in the 20s. However , it does feel a bit long and drawn out. This movie also feels very melodramatic , especially in the middle. That said , I did feel a bit emotional at the end of it all. I could understand the reasons he did what he did. The cast is good. The movie is well directed. I didn't dislike this movie , I just thought it wasn't perfect.|0
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to see it again. Anyone know where I can get a DVD of this movie? Hi, This was the 60s/70s series on NBC. I've not seen it. Maybe it's available on DVD. You may want to try Amazon.com . They have a lot of obscure old TV series' on DVD. You could check their site and see if they've got a copy available. Hope this helps. DONALD WOODS

Hello there, Donald!!"|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for one of these for awhile. Thanks! I have never seen it. Yep, I don't see why anyone would have the right to sue for reproducing something you can buy in a store, even if you're reproducing for profit. I don't know how that works, but it's bogus. I don't care how much a particular item goes for in stores. If I buy it at the store, it's mine.|0
"Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well. Some of the tracks sound kind of the same, but I guess that's what this genre tends to be like. If you're a fan you'll enjoy it if you're a non fan you may not. If you want a good collection of tracks of the genre this is a good album to try. Hardly a review of this genre, more of a ""look I'm a metalhead, so this genre must be shite, right?"""|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i would be very disappointed if there was not a sequal. I think that the people who gave it a bad review were the ones who dident pay attention to it or just didnt get it. They were probaly the people that were crying or screaming during the movie. If there is a sequel I think it will be really good because we will get to see more of Jackie Chan in it!!!!!!!!!|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video tutorials , reviews and how to's , and more . I wish you guys would get more popular. It's very helpful and entertaining. Thanks for all the info. I am a new subscriber and I've been watching it for about 6 months or so , but I just recently started commenting . Hope you keep up all the great shows you guys do. Thanks. I like this show and I like the hosts. Good luck to the hosts for the 1000 subscribers !!!!|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to grow a thicker skin if that is an area where you struggle with. You need to realize we all have differing senses of humors, and I don't understand why some of you feel like you need to attack and tear down others for having different opinions on what is funny. I was laughing my *** off at the OP's response and have nothing but respect for anyone who can post a response like that and not get butt-hurt because someone else doesn't agree with it .|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but it didn’t seem like one was planned. This is a great family film. It has lots of action, humor, and a very good moral to it. It is very enjoyable and entertaining, as well as an adventure. This movie is great for the kids and has a good family feel to it. There are some great one-liners in the movie that will have you in stitches. This movie has great special effects. This was a great movie.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. Great, great, great film. There is one scene that you have to watch for. We both left the theatre stunned. It is a scene with two elderly women that will make you gasp with the depth of emotion on display. Brilliantly directed, shot, acted. I want this film to be seen by as many people possible. It has a limited run in Chicago and if you have the chance to see it - please go.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. Her owner is taking her to his holiday villa in the South of France for a relaxing break. He will be gone for two days, leaving Duchess and her kittens to enjoy themselves in the luxurious villa. Duchess wants to enjoy the holiday with her family. She just has to keep out of the claws of her owner's snooping neighbor, Mrs. Pepperpot. And then there is the problem of Duchess' kittens - her three little kittens are so cute that Mrs. Pepperpot is determined they are hers.|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it ! ! The book was good, The movie was amazing . The actors did a great job, the story was good, and the special effects were awesome . It is a movie about a boy who turns 13 with a special power which can kill or heal someone with one touch. If you don’t know the story, read the book. Or watch the movie with your family. It’s amazing ! I give it 4 stars.|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could want in a 21st century reboot of a classic movie monster. This is a fun, exciting, visually stunning, emotionally engaging story. The cast is great. I think Bill Hader is perfect as the villain and his performance is so strong that I think he will be one of the more memorable things about this movie. He brings some of the best laughs and I 'm already looking forward to the sequel to see what he does in it.|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but this time it's aliens who have abducted a young couple and subjected them to horrible experiments. As if that wasn't bad enough, they also want to make them into sex slaves. But, in the meantime, their two best friends have come to spend the weekend at their house , so that the guys can find them. It's like one of those nightmare horror movies, where everybody you know turns against you , and you have to fend for yourselves.|0
"I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , the overall feeling of this story is one of the ""real"" world with a slight hint to fantasy or mythical creatures. It's an odd mixture of the fantastic , but the characters still have to make sense in a ""real"" world. I think you have to think about it like ""Blade Runner"" , with it's ""real"" people , but a slight hint to the SF of the film . The film is very much a fairytale with a real world setting, ala Alice in Wonderland."|0
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. It 's a little cheesier than the rest of the movies, but it has a few really good scares and moments. The Child 's Play movies are not my type of movies. I find them to be a little to cheesey and i do not like Chucky. Chucky was a good villain in the beginning, but when you keep making movies with the same character it becomes to repetitive. I really like this one. I think its my favorite Childs Play Movie.|0
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . Here, we are told it via images . And yes, there is music , which helps it . But the music is only there , as if we were listening to a great symphonic piece with a big orchestra , with its different melodies . With some images, the music almost seems to be an extension of what you are seeing on the screen . So, if you are a lover of films with a good story and lots of images, then this is your movie .|0
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There are some parts that are a bit boring , but there is a whole lot of laughter throughout. It's one of the best movie I've ever seen. Showtime is not an average film , but it's an exaggeration. It has a little stealing moments , but it does not mean it's the whole movie . I'm going to describe it first once you check out this movie you'll know it's good and not just a piece of crap .|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an investigation of the events surrounding it . What was the reason why the murder occurred at the very start of the episode ? Was it to establish the scene and atmosphere in which it occurred . As well as for the obvious reason that the murderer could be anybody . If we look at this episode from a psychological viewpoint ( and we have to do this) we may ask why the murder was committed in such a strange way .|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save Jack . Kate was with Jack and she was not happy . Desmond and Sayid showed up. In the hospital they had to give Kate something to stop the birth. They needed a heart beat so they gave her chloroform so she would fall asleep. They said she was going to die. Desmond was trying to say that everything would be ok. The nurse told them she could feel Jack's heart beat. They all got really happy. I don't have much time.|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man who has to protect his daughter from the evil in their house . This film is a definite must own if you are a serious horror collector . If you haven't seen it you are missing out on the greatness this movie has to offer . A young couple moves into the apartment across from the beautiful young widow of a local man who had recently died. They become friends and the widow invites the couple to her house. But the house is not quite as innocent as it would seem.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which I did not like . This movie is a brilliant love story with great actors and music. It is a love story in World War II, but it is more than that. I don't want to get into too many details. This movie has everything you'd want in a movie : great scenery, incredible music , great acting , love story , war , comedy, etc. The only bad part is that it's too short , it's only 104 minutes long.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the people in the film . It's not a bad film . I just think that they were a little too kind in the way the film was edited . If you watch it to the end and the credits then you will be able to see some of the mistakes in it . The film was made by the National Film Board . Their job was to make films about every day life . They were able to do this as long as they got the money to make these films from somewhere .|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to get more viewers a new darker theme was added . The stories were darker and much less hopeful , the series lasted another 3 seasons but never quite recovered from the change. This episode has a lot going on , from an astronaut returning from deep space to an alien visiting an early man on earth . While it starts with hope , it ends in tragedy . The story is an interesting one and takes us to a place where humans will never be .|0
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's gruesome violence, bizarre imagery and surreal quality. In the town of Aquila, a young boy is discovered murdered in a shallow grave. He was apparently killed because his mother refused to give up her duck. When the body of another young boy is found, it becomes apparent that a serial killer is on the loose, but the town's corrupt mayor (Fulci) refuses to allow any real investigation to be conducted.|0
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks over the years. This was my first time watching a movie he directed but didn 't actually make. The movie is about an anthropologist returning from South America with a rare plant to see his daughter who he hasn 't seen in some time. Upon his arrival he finds out his daughter is not living in her college dorms anymore and that she 's living in a shit hole with a bunch of roommates and a man named Paul.|0
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or redemption . I did not want to watch the whole thing, but I felt I should because the story was about something important. I watched the film through tears of rage and grief. The film was made by 4 men in the US who are, to all appearances, nice, well meaning, ordinary guys, but the men who made the film were blind, ignorant or arrogant in their judgement of this subject matter.|0
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , a young man in mid 1980s New York City . He and his buddy Dex ( Dante Brown ) are having a hard time holding down jobs , due to Reggie not wanting to be serious about things . They are also hustling in an effort to make ends meet . Reggie and Dex , along with a couple of friends , decide to get a better life by opening a limousine service , but it soon becomes apparent that they are running into trouble , both from the police and from crooks .|0
"David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary documentary about the creatures that inhabit the seas around remote Pacific islands. This is a follow up to ""Life on Earth"" and ""The Private Life of Plants "" series . The show features a vast array of species and is filmed at the world’s foremost laboratory and filming location for this type of wild life documentary. The show covers the evolution of fish and other creatures from water into land animals, their adaptations over the ages , their life cycle, reproduction, hunting and feeding ."|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's regarded as a master of gore , when really his forte was atmosphere . This is a film which is not so much about splatter or violence, but of the eerie, the unsettling , and the macabre , and the realization that humanity can be as horrible as anything you can think of. A group of young tourists come to New York for New Year 's celebrations, and soon enough are picked off by a mysterious killer , dressed in black .|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following and some interesting artwork but didn't know what to expect of the plot or how the film would turn out . This is not a typical slasher film with a masked killer or a psycho with a butcher knife or a machete, it has a very creepy atmosphere and an almost dreamy pace . There are two main characters but we never really get a feel for them until they begin to be killed off one by one and we begin to get an idea of who they were .|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. My daughter is in her teens now and we just bought it again because it is so good. She loves it as much as I do! I think it is the best movie I've ever seen. Not only is the story great, the acting is excellent, the music is superb! It is the best of the best. I hope everyone else will take the time to see it. Everyone should own this movie.|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families behind and try for a better life in Belgium, where they may find work as servants. One of them, who works as a cleaner in a Belgian brothel, marries an unscrupulous Belgian who makes her work as a sex slave in order to pay back her family's debts. Soon the other Africans arrive to join her husband, and they all form a community which they protect as if it were a small African village.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an American writer named Paul and an ex-girlfriend respectively. “It was a very easy pitch. We just sat down and talked about it.” says John Madden who is best known for directing such hits as Shakespeare In Love, Proof and The Debt. As to how much of an impact this movie has made on him, John has this to say: “A film like this can change your life and can also change your view on life in general.|0
Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But he can come back to life , and that's just what happened here . This time Chucky is voiced by Brad Dourif . He plays Charles Lee Ray ( Chucky to his fans ) , the murderous 30 year-old man-child who returns to life as the devilish doll . Dourif has a distinct voice that fits well into the part . He also gives the voice to the voice box that Chucky is stuck inside , and Chucky has some interesting things to say .|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them, in that it managed to create and sustain a strong sense of connection between the two central characters. This was done without the characters even having a single real conversation. This was achieved by the use of silence, which was filled in, not only by the background music and soundtrack, but by what was going on outside the main focus of the shot. In Besson 's film, there is an air of romance throughout the film without the characters ever having to say so.|0
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this post. I am soooo grateful that his son, Ross, gave me permission in March of this year ( 2007 ) to post the video of Ross and his Dad's last conversation , together on stage . It will be with me always . A treasure to be cherished always. In May of 2006 , Ross and his Father , Spike , together in an intimate setting , at The Bickford Theatre, Drew University , New Jersey .|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes place in a prison , with one of the guards being the protagonist . However there is nothing really about prisons or prisoners , except for the protagonist being in the prison . It has a really good character study in it , and this is what makes it stand out in a very crowded field of crime films . There is really nothing else to say , the acting is good , the story is good , and that’s about it .|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch on TV . I will admit that she is NOT a foodie or food connoiseur . What she IS is fun and funny , fresh , and a joy to watch on TV . I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, fresh and a joy to watch on TV. She also has the best cooking show I've ever watched. The reason is that she doesn't talk about food. She talks about life.|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but without sentimentality. He also manages to be funny without being too farcical, so the movie is never too heavy going. The movie is well-written and has a few interesting twists, which keep the audience guessing right until the end. It does tend to be slightly too long and slow at times, though that's not a major complaint. This is also a beautifully-shot film. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes thoughtful movies with a strong storyline and excellent acting.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't that good , but its still an enjoyable Disney movie that kids and adults will enjoy equally . It's worth watching and it's definitely worth buying on DVD and/ or Blu Ray . It was very funny , and had a lot of good messages and morals to live by . There were lots of laughs in it , and it made me really happy to watch it . The characters are really cute , and there are some other great ones in the movie to .|0
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book a couple of years ago , I came to realise how prophetic it had been . I was amazed. This book had been written back in 1971 and the story was set in a world where the government was in a state of permanent emergency due to a terrorist threat . A world where the citizens could be arrested without trial , where the police had the ' right to search and seize any person , premises or property' and where all letters and packages were read .|0
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is funny too. This is a very funny and interesting movie. A very beautiful and touching film! I love the animation! Love this movie, the animation was very cute. The movie has so many hidden gems that people may miss during their first watch. Worth multiple watches just to discover more and more. This is such a great and funny movie! Really enjoyed the storyline! The animation in this movie is so beautiful, and I really enjoyed watching it.|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
"Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a slight southern accent ( his home is in Nashville ) that he does not use as often as others. He does a very good Buddy. He does not go all out as he does in other roles, such as when he plays a psychotic killer on the CSI Las Vegas show. But the guy does a creditable job in the movie. Gary Busey in Buddy Holly Story - 1985
Buddy Holly ( 1936 - 1959) was a rock n' roll and country singer."|0
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a girlfriend, friend or prospect of either. In a last desperate attempt to turn his life around and impress the one girl he still cares about (Amanda Seyfried), he decides to make the biggest and bravest speech of his life. But just when he is about to give it, a group of misfit kids from his high school shows up at his house with their own agenda: to make a film on him and use it as an opportunity to relive their teen years.|0
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to hit the big screen . Cream Cheese was a thing . And a man named Harvey Gould was the first to ever make it rain on Broadway . Harvey Gould is the name of a man known for making the first ever bubble machine. Harvey was born in the year 1909 in England. He loved making things, and one of the first things he wanted to make when he was a kid was a bubble machine .|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . I am not one of those people . It is well made , well directed and a very intelligent film . I liked the way the characters interact with each other , the music , and the fact that the viewer is allowed to use their own imagination in some of the storylines . There is a certain elegance about this movie , and I found it very refreshing to see it was not so full of violence and sexual content . Loved it!|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . I know , I should have been more educated on my movie viewing . It was pretty damned good . I always love movies that are shot on film , and this one is no different . It’s a well made film , with excellent performances . It is the story of a 17 year old boy named Billy . He is the son of a Vietnam veteran who died in Vietnam , and he has no fatherly guidance in his life . His mother is a drunk , and a prostitute .|0
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite some of the flaws , it has enough to keep you enthralled till the very end . Verdict - A MUST watch . I think it is not fair to compare this with the original. They are totally different beasts and one is just a good movie while the other is a cult classic with a cult following. But that said, its a decent movie with some cool effects and interesting story. The kids who play the children were really cute and the lead guy was very impressive too.|0
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare item and so well packaged, and then you receive such a good product. It's a must have. Thank you. After years of using other brush cleaners, I decided to try out a new one that would actually do a good job at it. And this seems to be the right choice, since I have never had problems with the cleaning. I really appreciate the bristles being detached, so you do not have to be careful when storing it in your purse or handbag.|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , its crew ( The Monkees and James Cagney’s older brother William) , and even its writers ( The Monkees and William Rose ) , but also for the songwriter. It was released in 1969 when the music scene was just starting to change, just starting to branch out into things like “psychedelic,” “folk rock,” and so on. Head was a comedy film, but not a slapstick comedy film; it was a black comedy with a dark theme.|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was nominated for best actor , his role was very small . It's also hard to imagine how this was rated 18 in 1959 , there's no nudity , bare breasts are shown but the characters are so young that its not meant to be suggestive , and the violence is very underplayed . Great flick , I'd say if you're going to watch a movie about juvenile delinquents , you might as well watch a good film . I really like The Blackboard Jungle.|0
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the pilot episode , the writers really know what they're doing and i hope season three is just as good as 1& 2 . I cant stop watching the show it's just sooooo good !!!!!!!!! 3.0 out of 5 starsNot as bad as other people said it is! Well this is my first review so be gentle! :D Anyway, the storyline is really interesting. I would like to know what happens next, however I did think the ending was very rushed.|0
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an action movie and is more than an hour longer than it really should be but who cares ! I don't. The cast, script, direction and music all gel together to create a truly epic movie. Everyone is outstanding in it and it's one of my absolute all time favorite movies . If I were to pick just one movie, it'd be Pearl Harbor, and if I were to pick a director, Spielberg wouldn't even be in the running.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out. I have been searching it for 2 weeks and that I can not learn where to buy it. Is it possible for someone to assist me please. I'd greatly appreciate you. I have had the opportunity over the past year to see many of his films. He really is a genius! If you like foreign films, you'll love it. If you don't like foreign films, you will also love it.|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's a very well written series, directed with great talent , it is also the most imaginative and surprising show of all times. The story is amazing and the actors amazing too . This is a series in which the characters and the actor who play them are extremely realistic and beliveble in every detail. It 's really sad to see the end and I really hate it . It 's the first time that i really really hate an end in a serie , it 's my favorite of all the series i ever watched .|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber is attempting to repeat the trick, this time for Easter with the release of his new single “Easter”! It is the first of two Easter themed releases from Justin. The other is “That’s What Love Can Do”, due for release next Friday. This track, “Easter” was recorded in LA and was co-produced by Justin along with the renowned Skrillex. It features guest vocals from Halsey, plus the track’s production was mixed by Grammy Award winner Diplo.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of what is going on around us in the World. I was amazed at how it explained so many aspects about the world around us, and it helped me put in perspective a few things that I had no clue about . The only drawback , was not being able to explain more in-depth , about what I believe is the root cause of the world's issues. This is really a fantastic series, and one that should be required viewing for every member of the United Nations!|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better. This is an amazing movie about two young girls that are the best of friends, but one of them has a secret that will destroy everything they have worked for . It was a nice movie and I thought the two main characters were good actresses , but I did think that in the end the movie was too abrupt , it could have been better , but other than that I enjoyed the movie . I recommend it to anyone who likes good movies and a good story line.|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime. And yet somehow, every week I find a movie that is a true crime story that I have not seen. That happened to me this weekend with Eyeball Kids, a 2018 horror movie about a serial killer who targets teenagers and removes one of their eyes. I can’t even remember where I first heard about it, but it was just enough to pique my curiosity and I wanted to find out if it was any good.|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to make this film more effective . It is a tribute to a life of a real person , not an actor , and he has done his best . I really liked it , it was the first film where I could see his emotions , I never really saw him in other films , he was an actor , but in this movie I felt that he really is a person . The music and his voice made him a real person . I am very glad that it was a success .|0
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy Eddie Murphy seems to be out of ideas lately . The movie is just an excuse to use his gross out humor and bad taste jokes . Murphy plays three different characters all of whom have his looks but different voices . It's kind of cute to see him switch from the snooty doctor to the red neck biker guy but the story goes on too long and it gets old . The movie doesn't make any sense . Eddie murphy is a very talented comedian .|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the title character, who is a military man trying to find his place in occupied Greece during WW II. His relationship with a woman who has been left behind provides much of the emotional core of the film. It is a war story, and that is not my preference, but it is well done. There is also a lot of beautiful scenery and period costume and decoration, and that I liked. It is based on the bestseller by Louis de Berniere, a British author, and that helps as well.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie fast forwards to sometime later with the Monkey King and Pigsy meeting two sisters that the king is going to test on. The sisters pass with flying colors with the Monkey King taking an interest in the older sister. He also takes a liking to a beautiful painting of her in his room. This causes some trouble for Pigsy since she has a thing for him as well and she becomes jealous. The King then decides to test the younger sister who he is less interested in but the king is interested in.|0
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but I have to admit I did like it. I was surprised with some scenes , I have to admit I cried and laughed , I enjoyed the humor , the action , and the twists. So if you like horror and comedy movies, you might want to check out this flick on a free movie night with your friends or on a movie night with you and your spouse or loved one, I give it 4 / 5 stars for sure.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling. Thank you!! I'm not an artist, just a fan. Thank you. Beautiful and moving. I'd love to see them in a film. This is absolutely stunning! You should be so proud! Beautiful and poignant. I love the pensive, reflective look in his eyes in many of these. Thank you for capturing these precious memories for us. Such precious memories! Love them all.|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that most of the songs were composed on the spot. I don't know the director , but he's a genius and deserves all the applause that he is getting for this movie. I can understand why he has taken so long in making this movie . One can't possibly do justice to such an excellent script unless he is an absolute professional and a true genius. What is the song in this movie where an unnamed female singer wearing a green dress is performing infront of a big gathering of men?|0
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) so I am pretty sad that it's almost over. I think that my favorite parts of the show are the celebrity interviews, I love how they are all so different and it's nice to see them being themselves and how they do their hair and makeup, and I also love the celeb videos and the bloopers
So if you've watched the show at all, do you know why it is almost done ?"|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this. This is a simple story. This is the story about a guy who was born and grew up in slums who is not happy with his present job and want to get out of this. Then he meets a rich guy who offers a job for him. He takes this offer and gets married to his daughter and becomes a rich man. The whole movie is a journey of this guy who is happy with his new wealth and position and how he changes with time.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and the whole team for making this happen. A must see for the whole family. Loved it. Very enjoyable, interesting story with some very good lessons. I think I might try to watch it again. This film is the story of the 50 year friendship between two great American painters and sculptors, Georgia O'keefe and Alexander Calder and how they helped each other through times of great personal difficulty. This film is based on letters, interviews, personal memories and art of the artists.|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it was first broadcast on TCM. You can view my film notes from 1992 on my page for this film but I shall give a brief run down as it is a very enjoyable one and worth seeking out the film if you can find a copy. This film has some wonderful music and the songs used are not only good but are very fitting to the plot. This film has some superb sets which really help to place the film in the time and place that it is set.|0
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a great movie. It takes place in London , where a group of people are being murdered with a sledge hammer, and then they are later strangled by a man with gloves. It has a great cast , and the movie is pretty entertaining, especially towards the end, where a great final twist unfolds on the viewer. I highly recommend this movie to any fans of the Gialli, and also to anyone that is just a fan of suspense movies.|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . It is an Argentine film directed by Lucía Puenzo, and based on a book by Argentine writer Eduardo Sacheri . The screenplay was written by Lucía Puenzo , Sergio Dubcovsky and Alejandro Pinto . It is a psychological thriller that tells a story of love, power, and greed in Argentina’s upper classes during the late 1970s and 1980s , following a blind girl whose dreams of travel and a “ normal” life are thwarted when she discovers the dark secret of her wealthy family.|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. In an interview on the BBC's Newsbeat programme he has stated: ""I've done about eight movies, some of the big ones like Big Daddy. I'd like to continue with the movies. I don't want it to stop, I like acting a lot, the movies have done a lot for me. I think we can work on it for about another two years, that's about right. That's my estimation of my career, that'll be the limit."|0
"Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without comparison. Herzog has said that ""It's one of his favorite films. He believes it was his finest work as a director"". The film is based upon a true story, but the filmmaker's imagination has been allowed to roam free in creating his own version of the events. It begins by taking us inside the mind and soul of a Vietnamese man who has come to the belief that the only way to get out of his predicament is to become a famous actor."|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' This was Garfield's third film. He was cast as a young hoodlum who becomes a policeman to make good with his girl ( Eleanor Parker ). He falls in with the mob, is framed for the murder of a crooked cop, and goes to the electric chair. Garfield did all his own fight scenes, and the climactic death scene, where he plunges into a vat of molten metal, is a thriller in itself.|0
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from late 20’s to early 70’s. Most have worked for many years and have raised families, but never really knew each other. Some have been married. Some have had children. Many still working. Some of the women have never left the work force and are now coming out to play at their age. Some have worked their whole lives. The guys are not as different, as most of them have either worked or raised families.|0
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and John Ritter , we discover the secret behind the psychopathic doll. Indeed, the story is quite complex but it is never too complicated and it goes very well. A very good movie , a good movie for fans but a good movie at all . It 's a shame that the sequel was not really good . But it is very sad to learn that this was the last movie John Ritter , which was very good. Chucky is back for a fifth time ... but the story is about his wife.|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I highly recommend it. I've read it a few times in the past few decades and every time it just keeps getting better!! FYI, It has just come out in a new edition with a great introduction by Tom Stoppard . It's the first time it has been out since 1936 . I can't wait for it to hit Amazon and the rest of the internet so I can get a copy and read it again.|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz is very pretty and I liked the Italian backdrop. The book is about much more than beauty though . It is a moving account of war and of love. In 1939 the island of Cephallonia in the Ionian Sea is conquered by Italy and the Italian occupation forces set up base in the old fort. They soon discover that the local doctor, the island's only doctor in fact , is incompetent. They decide to import an Italian doctor and send for Dr Pelagia.|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with most of what has been written about this film. I think this movie is overrated and that the story is not as complex as many film reviewers have suggested it is. Although I enjoyed the movie, it did not stand up to the expectations that I had. I thought that it would be a bit more complex. The movie begins with a group of Americans on a plane. One of the people on the plane is named Betty.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (and that's putting it very mildly). We know it was a sad life, but I'm sure we knew that. I would have liked to have known more specifics. The most interesting story was about the last few years of her life when she was in a coma in a London hospital, but, alas, it was not elaborated upon at all. Also, I thought the actors did not resemble the subjects enough.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that's going to Japan, where he meets a Japanese feline. After Sylvester steals some sushi and gets into a fight with a Japanese cat, the ship lands on an island in the South Pacific with Sylvester now stuck there. Tweety comes along in a helicopter and gets Sylvester back to the States, where Tweety and Sylvester get in another fight with the Japanese feline and are sent back to Japan. Tweety S.o.s Episode 1. Tweety's S.o.s is a series that aired in 2002 and is set in the 18th century.|0
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the tough issues of adoption and infertility. It's a book I've had on my bookshelf a long time and I was so glad I finally decided to read it! It made me think of all of the friends I've lost touch with over the last 20 years and how hard it is to see what their lives must be like as adults. I cried more than once as the book wound to a conclusion that felt very real.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss through the story of a man and his beloved dog. This is the powerful, emotional, and visually breathtaking story of a man named John and his relationship with the dogs he's known throughout his lifetime. John has owned, trained, and cared for a number of dogs, and through those relationships he has witnessed love, loyalty, pain, and devastation. In the early 1960s John meets and befriends a puppy that will become his lifelong companion.|0
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the films that I will always remember it and the way that I will always watch when I am really down. A movie like this will never get old for me. I love all of the scenes from this movie , and if I could I would watch it everyday! It's not perfect , but it's very good! I recommend this movie for everyone! I am not one to give up hope, and this movie is another example of why that is a great thing to be.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with excellent writing , direction , and acting. It’s a pity this kind of episode is so rare , but it is an example of how great Star Trek can be . The Enterprise is out exploring when a Starfleet monitoring station picks up a ship matching the Enterprise’s speed and heading. They can not identify the ship , but as it approaches the station it starts to fire weapons on it. The Enterprise responds by firing back , and after an intense exchange both ships go to red alert.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about death. I was expecting to see death from many different angles , but I ended up seeing it from one point of view . The main idea of the video is that there is one moment in our life we are afraid of . I found this video really interesting and shocking . I really liked the video , because the way that the film maker presented his point of view and the idea he wanted to convey to the audience was really good .|0
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Cannonball 2 '' ? If you're a fan of all this type of movies i'm pretty sure you like this movie a lot. Because it's very similar, it's just a little bit better. If you want to see a better movie i can recommend you this movie called `` Top Secret '' with Val Kilmer, or you could watch some other cool movies, like this good movie i saw a few months ago called `` L. A.|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NYC blackout of the summer of '77. I saw this movie in the theaters. I remember it being pretty cool, but then again I was a young teenager back in the day so anything seemed cool. I watched this movie last night with my dad. I haven't seen it in the theater. It was entertaining, but also pretty silly. One of my favorite movies of the '70s. A classic film which I first saw around 1978 when it was on TV.|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse'. It has a nice enough story about Ali, his sidekick, Baba and the gang, but the jokes are so similar to the ones in the television series that there was little to laugh at. Billed as a comedy, the movie failed to entertain and was a huge disappointment, which I would not watch again. If you want to know more about Ali G you're better off watching the tv shows. 3.0 out of 5 starsA funny and entertaining movie!|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 isn't too bad though . I give it a 6.75/10 . It's worth your time but not worth your money , if you buy it on sale. I would wait for it on Netflix or get it on cable. Terrible film. Not one of the better 'Death Wish' films. It's a terrible remake and it is a terrible film overall. The worst of all the films. This movie was just a mess. It's too much of a downer.|0
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him and sends him to the ground. The car stops, the window is lowered and a hand reaches out towards the bike and the bike’s bag. As the bike falls on top of the old man, the driver of the car looks over his shoulder, sees what has happened, shuts the door and drives away. The man lies there on his back; the blood is flowing from his head. His glasses are smashed and his face is cut and bruised.|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the boring start and did not really make an impact with the viewers, in spite of the big name actors involved. The film is essentially about two people who are strangers and find their way to one another when they need someone the most in their life. The film was shot in India. The two protagonists, who are also the only actors in the film start out as complete strangers and gradually develop a bond as we see them grow together and support each other in their darkest hour.|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) , an executive in a major Manhattan advertising agency who has been passed over for promotion because he is Negro , as he is chosen by the board of directors to succeed the dying president ( Bill Cosby ) . This movie was made during the height of the Black Power movement. This movie is about an African-American executive who has been passed over for promotion because he is Negro. He is chosen to succeed the dying President of the company.|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper , of course, was very good but it was not a film that made any kind of impression upon my young mind . Perhaps the story is dated , and not enough of interest , but certainly not one of Hopper's finest movies , and it seemed to lack the intensity of his other films of the 1950's . But , who knows ? I may be wrong , it certainly didn't leave any lasting memories !|0
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. If you want a movie that is a light watch, not to deep, but also not stupid, then this would be perfect. I liked the chemistry between Ryan (Ryan Gosling), and Claire (Rachel McAdams). I thought Ryan had a nice sense of humor, with an edge. In fact his character is very much an edge. There was a sweetness to Claire's character, but also not to innocent. She was strong.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1

"Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter made his name in the mid 1950s with three back to back number one hits and a string of big hits , including ""That'll be the Day "" , "" Oh Boy "" and ""Peggy Sue .""

When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
"OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just perfect and so are the locations. I loved this movie a lot.. It is a remake of a hindi film 'Pyar Ke Side Effects"" which was pretty decent.. This is about a young man and a young lady who are just friends but eventually end up together. It all happens very spontaneously and very realistically.. The story revolves around the lives of the young people and their respective parents. This is one movie you will enjoy a lot and will be able to watch it more than once.."|0
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Hurt in this role , one of his very best. And the storyline was well-written and well-developed with excellent acting and direction. I loved this film , the soundtrack is also great. It's one that will stay with me. If this movie was on television, and you could only watch it once...I would still buy the soundtrack. If this soundtrack had been made available separately, it definitely would have gone on my holiday gift list. The music was amazing!|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must say, I love it when the writers make references to the other things they've wrote, because I usually get it . In this one , I thought the writers made a reference to a character named Bart's Dad , who had a beard ( I am not making this up , the writers of the simpsons did make a character with a beard ) , and in the beginning of this episode , they say that Bart is 10 years old .|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . Excellent acting , great story line , brilliant direction , wonderful production values and superb cinematography made it a very watchable one . The chemistry between Aishwariya and Abhishek was so good that you can actually see the love between them . I was very touched by this movie as it made me revisit my childhood . All the songs were so beautiful and suited the character perfectly . All the child artists in this movie are so cute and you simply fall in love with them .|0
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom in it, but it is impossible to explain the whole of it. I feel like it's a very deep musical that will stay with me for a while. If you get to see it you will be able to see it for yourself, but for now I will just have to tell you my own interpretation of the play, and it's not exactly how the director wants the play to end, but more like my take on the whole story.|0
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent in the US secret service who has been assigned the task of taking over the security arrangements for the newly elected President , who is played by Alan Ladd , for a trip to the U.S.A from Romania . The trip to America goes wrong and Ladd's plane crashes . Crystal finds himself in a remote location in the woods and has to go looking for help to find the plane wreckage and the passengers . Meanwhile Ladd is in the plane , but has no idea where it has crashed .|0

Will he succumb to evil or can the power of love save him? Jekyll And Hyde was released on DVD 44d ago in the US. The upcoming release date is November 13, 2018."|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the girl of his life to notice. Chaplin’s face is covered by makeup to give him a darker look. Made shortly before he was drafted for service in the Great War, ‘Chaplin’s Doughboy’ is one of the few American films from 1918 that survive in decent condition and which is available on DVD. It was directed by Arthur Berthelet, the man who would go on to direct Charlie Chaplin’s films in the silent era.|0
"SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's movies, it was the little things that made up the bulk of the comedy. For example, in ' The Tramp 's Strong Arm ' , the gags are built up by little gestures or facial expressions: the Tramp getting out of jail and patting his backside to be sure it is still there, looking up at the moon and thinking ' Oh , I forgot I was outside ' . The little things that made his movies funny are what are remembered by most.

I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific situations but he also gave his characters the depth needed to drive home his stories. He is often overlooked but is very much appreciated by me. I love Fulci's film-making style. He is definitely one of the great directors of horror. Loved it. I love to watch Zombie films. Loved it, this is one of my top zombie films. Best Zombie movie I've ever seen! I'd love a DVD release with English subtitles for my DVD player.|0
"inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which the genius artist is trapped in , this movie gives you a great insight about the human nature . i must say its a must watch for all of us to understand the human nature and the dilemma an artist faces . it's kinda long but it is worth the wait. I am a fan of Park Chang Wook. I first watched his acting in ""Dream High"", then went on to watch his other dramas. I watched ""I am Sam"" and was completely blown away."|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between them are riveting and it's a shame this isn't a full-length feature. There are also a couple of scenes that could have been better shot. The movie has a lot of the usual plot elements, but the characters are so interesting that it keeps you glued to the screen. There is a lot of violence, though not graphically portrayed. Overall, this is a really good film. Beware. This is a 63-minute movie. It is advertised as being 83 minutes.|0
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear has played a woman and i was sure that this movie can’t be good. But when i watched it , i was very impressed. It’s a story about love, life, family , friendships and how difficult is to choose between those and the career. I really loved that the movie had not only romantic scenes, but also a good balance of family scenes with the husband and the kids. The story is not original , but the way it was interpreted is so good.|0
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this movie. The music is excellent , as well as the direction and cinematography. We have to wait for more from Eastwood as a director: I hope that he will give us something else. This one , however , will remain in time as an example of how a director ( with a great background) can work with a great script. The story , though simple in its basic concepts , develops with a nice pace, without losing its tension all the time.|0
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It's not a masterpiece in the style of their earlier work but it is certainly worth listening to - and if I'm honest a better listen that the last two studio albums that they've produced since their reunion - although to be fair I do like the last album too . It's a very atmospheric album , quite dark and bleak but with it's own kind of beauty . As with all of their albums it does have some excellent songs on it .|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I've seen quite a number of movies that are in the genre of horror thriller and this one is among the best I 've seen in a long time. The plot is great , the acting is great . The movie does a great job at keeping your interest and making you really care about the main character and the people around him . I liked this movie and I think it is a very worthwhile movie experience .|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the world. Inspired by the writings of H.P.Lovecraft, this film tells a story of two friends and their unexplainable adventures in an unknown realm. It’s a journey that leaves us questioning the unseen in the world around us. An unassuming, darkly hilarious examination of an American family’s misadventures when an outsider enters their lives. It’s a tale that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever been a child, a parent, or just human.|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a novelty act ( and they were that too ) . However , despite all the criticism they received , they were one of the most talented acts in Rock & Roll history . This 5 disc box set is a testament of their amazing musical talent . It contains over 100 unreleased and previously released performances , including 60 songs recorded for various radio and television specials from the 60's . The box also contains the Monkees 20th anniversary reunion concert from 1986 and a full color 40-page book .|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and this was just like a home movie being there , the rest of the movie just made me cringe and feel sick , I just could not relate at all with the characters and they were just a bunch of losers , it was a bit like a reality show and in that respect I did not enjoy the movie , I know its supposed to be satire and all that but I do not like this type of humor .|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention and I found it to be an enjoyable, interesting watch. It's about the lives of a group of young men and women living in Sydney in the 90s. It centres around the life of Darren who is played by Simon Baker ( who I really like as an actor , he's very good ) , the rest of the cast play his friends and girlfriends ( one of who he eventually ends up with ).|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . I am sure you will agree with me in this. I am not saying that this is a wonderful movie because I love the music, no I love the music because this film is a great film. It is an absolute treasure and I love it. The story is a fun adventure romp, which is what the best 1970’s musicals were all about. The plot in a nutshell, is the story of an American pilot Frank Capra, who is lost in the mountains of Tibet.|0
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about violence . This kind of short films have their importance too in terms of artistic creation. I agree with the other commentaries, this film is touching and a tribute to the work of those who dedicate themselves to the rescue of the street children. The characters are very well interpreted and they are very natural. It was nice to see this film that tells about the reality for the children on the streets. It would have been even more touching to see a little bit more their situation.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the rules – there is a solid narrative structure which is easy to follow, it contains recognisable set-pieces, it’s paced in such a way as to build suspense and there’s a clear ‘hero’ character for audiences to root for (in the person of James Brolin, who plays the hapless father of a couple of boys). This is the type of movie that you can watch again a year down the line and still appreciate.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and even when they have, you'll have to pay more for it). Luckily, I found it online and watched the movie. I was surprised with the movie, they did a great job in telling the true story about a young man who suffered from mental illness and the difficulties in finding his proper medication. I recommend watching it, it's a really good movie. I'm also hoping that it will help people to understand about mental illness more.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was made in 1941 and starred a young actor named Jackie Cooper . He is the son of Jack Cooper, who appeared in movies with such actors as John Wayne and Roy Rogers . Jackie is the same Jackie Cooper who starred in the Mickey Mouse show and in the movie Skippy . I 'm trying to find out if Jackie Cooper is still alive. He would be 89 if he is . I would really appreciate any help or information you can provide . Thank you very much.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down on ebay in a boxed DVD set and it turned out to contain the entire movie. Hmm, I was just about to buy this from BFI. I'll have to hold out now. I recently rewatched it, it's not just a great movie but an interesting time capsule, it's interesting to see how certain things have developed since it was made, it shows a lot of things in this movie are just as relevant today as they were in the 1960s.|0
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The story, which takes place in a parallel universe , centers around two characters that live in a society in which the government has banned sex and intimacy. There is a rebellion, led by this couple and they must try to get the government to realize their mistake. This film deals with the subjects of government censorship and prejudice . Much of the story in ` Head ` takes place within the home of the main couple, John and Anabelle .|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast - it was hard to expect less than a good film - and the result was excellent. This is not a Hollywood film - it's set in 1947, after the war, in London - but it was shot in Wales. In fact it's a remake of a British film, 'Saving Grace' from 1929 - with a very different plot but the same title. In this version, Grace is an unwed mother in a care home run by Sister Ruth, played by Tom Wilkinson.|0
"This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the actors, the realistic portrayal of Jim, the music, and the gritty depiction of a life that was cut short. It all worked. And the soundtrack, featuring some of his biggest hits, will be a timeless reminder of his music. I don't think I would call this a true ""rock"" film. The music seems to have a lot more of an R & B and Soul feel (which isn't really my thing)."|0
"Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most of Garp's story took place off-stage and that the author left a lot to the reader 's imagination. I remember thinking at the time, ""What's the point in telling the story of a writer 's life if you won 't even show it to me?"" I had a similar experience with The Widow of the South by Robert Farris Thompson, and when I thought about it, I realized that it was probably more about the storyteller than the story being told."|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (both of which starled in the early 80s, so it’s not too surprising). This is a movie that will be of particular interest to car-lovers and motorsports fans. It contains a lot of interesting automobiles in addition to a lot of great racing and drag-racing action footage, with some great-looking period shots of desert-based motorsports and off road racing action. The narration and voice-over script is pretty awful, but the rest of the movie is great.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be an outstanding documentary and one of the better documentary films I had seen over the years. The way in which it is shot and edited was brilliant as it was extremely artistic and poignant. One thing that I would say to anyone that hasn’t seen it yet is don’t miss it if you get the chance. I am really happy to be involved with the documentary and look forward to watching the finished product. Good Luck with everything and enjoy the rest of the editing.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing where it was heading, it took a different twist than he expected. It was very moving, and it will be interesting to hear the next part when it appears. I'm glad you both watched it and found it moving. I too was surprised by how it turned out. Sorry you are still sick. You need a holiday. Yes - you are right ... I could really do with some time away from the daily routine of work and family ...|0
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is half-hearted but the action sequences are impressive. The story centers on a small-town police department , led by Sheriff Sam ( Jack Nicholson ) . The town is being terrorized by two gangs - one lead by the sadistic Floyd , the second by the ruthless Havenshaw . The police have a plan to arrest Floyd , but when the gangsters find out , they take over the town and terrorize its residents . The police are now under Floyd's command .|0
"A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in spite of my initial reluctance to like it
Sadly I have to agree with everyone else here, this was dreadful! The animation was cheap, the jokes were weak, the main character was flat and uninteresting and the story just wasn't engaging or funny! It really wasn't anything worth watching, it was a waste of time! Sadly I'll have to agree with everyone here as well, this was dreadful!"|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , one from when I first saw it on TV and one from when HBO ran the series . I was so disappointed when this series ended with only 1 season , but at least we got some movies . I wonder if they will ever show us another sequel or prequel . The first movie I saw this on was on a cruise ship and we couldn't believe how great this movie was and how it looked so real .|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and of her dreams: she loves to read books and to travel. One day the girl discovers a book with a title that touches her and she falls in love with the story and the characters of the book she has just found. Soon she decides to embark on a journey full of surprises, with no return. In the adventure, Valeria discovers amazing places such as Rome, Barcelona, New York City, San Francisco, Paris and Venice, meeting new people every day.|0
"Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I’m glad I decided to go with my own judgement on it , instead of relying on others . The actors, director , costumes, scenery , everything was so perfect ! I can’t wait until it comes out on blu-ray . I hope they have a lot of behind the scene features , just so I can keep watching . Great movie . By Katie B,
Loved it! It's been so long since I've seen a romantic comedy that was actually romantic."|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited to see it. And then they waited. For some reason that I'll never understand, the film was released to video before it ever hit a theater. It wasn't a small theater release that got bumped to DVD before its run. It was a large-scale studio release that got pushed out the door to the home market before most people could even see it in theater. The movie itself was very enjoyable.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine performance , this film would have been a complete and utter flop . Gary Busey really did a good job portraying a guy who was so completely out of touch with reality that it was not only hard to watch him , but very sad too . The other characters in this film were all rather boring and ordinary , but this one was the star . The movie itself was nothing special , but it was entertaining . I have had a crush on Sharon Stone since Basic Instinct .|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put a smile on your face and make a believer of even the most stalwart skeptic. These films are so good that you'll forget that they aren't real, and then you'll forget that they are supposed to be faked. Either way you're in for a real treat! Science fiction fans will be thrilled at the appearance of so many famous characters from their favourite programmes. And for the rest of the family, the spectacular special effects will be a thrill in its own right!|0
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also explains why I have a lot of the original VHS tapes. There are so many good memories. It is very hard to pick a favourite episode. I loved the first season of Stingers and it's not fair that it only lasted for one season. It was such a fun and original show. I think the reason it only ran for a season is that CBS didn't have the advertising budget for it. They had the rights for Stargate.|0
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the Taisho and Showa periods. Miyazawa Kenji wrote many works in a unique style, with a combination of traditional Japanese culture and the modern Western influence. The writer's own words are interwoven with the music to create a truly unique piece. ""Song of the Earth"" is a piece from one of Miyzawa Kenji's best-loved collections, ""Yume Miru Uchu."" The piece depicts the earth as it changes over the years, and is sung and played by an orchestra and a choir."|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot , lots of blood and action . I really liked that they didnt spend half the movie talking. This was a very fun action movie that has some twists that I never expected . There are also a few very funny scenes in the movie . I have to say though that I think I have seen it all in this movie . They have done everything they can and there is nothing left to add to an action movie.|0
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of action, suspense, and creativity that went in to this story line. You're not going to find much action when watching this movie so it's more of a drama, but the story line is amazing. In a world where people have become so dependent on technology for everything we do, this movie showed how that could be a very dangerous thing, not only on the outside but inside of us as well.|0
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and a lot of other great actors I didn't recognize ! I really like the story , but I can't understand all the french in it. What about the french in a french film ! It's always a challenge for the actors. But I'm glad we have subtitles ! If you can't understand the french in this film it's more a lack of french than a bad translation of this wonderful film. I really enjoyed it and would love to see it again !|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows a few ideas from it though . This film features a group of travelling musicians who are trying to avoid the authorities because they are outlaws . They come across a remote village where the locals don't even know what a guitar is . They stay for the night in the local inn . They stay in the same room as the young daughter of the owner . This story has all the makings of a good tale . You just know something bad is about to happen .|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , the version of the film that I saw has been cut down in the past by an additional 5 minutes from the full 175 minute version that was made available by Kino in 2013. The film is a silent film from 1916. The film is an epic historical romance that takes place over many years in 18th century Austria. This film is about an Austrian countess Anna (played by Pauline Frederick) who has to endure a miserable marriage of convenience in order to inherit her father's wealth.|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original idea, and a strong cast to back up the story. There are a lot of things to like about it, and even a few that could have been improved upon. I am sure some of you have seen it, so I’m sure you could agree that this movie was one of those feel-good flicks that was able to get you laughing a couple times and leave the theater feeling good with a smile on your face. I think the script is what really made this movie worthwhile.|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , this film should provide endless pleasure. For those that don't think they're intelligent enough to be able to 'get' this film , you may need to 'dumb down' your intellect a bit before watching it. 'The Holy Grail' is a film that is a perfect example of what can be achieved when you take a classic source text and adapt it to the screen in a manner that pays homage and respect to the original.|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like a fairytale , it would be just that. A tale for the young ones , the little ones , and us as well I think . I always have been fascinated , no , intrigued and enchanted by fairy tales . The idea of a world you could go to if you only had the guts to go into the woods , climb a mountain , dive into a sea , find a secret gate , or maybe just open a book and go there.|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies a lot but am not very into reading. So I'm just going by the cover and the story line that I just read . If it's any good it's just by chance that I came into it . My husband has always wanted me to watch it , so he'll have to watch and let me know how it goes ..
Anyways I went into the theaters tonight with no idea of what this was going to be about ."|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched the movie last weekend and the movie was very good. I think it is a good adaptation of a book. There are things that I think could have been added and things that I think were cut out of the movie that were really important. I was disappointed at the movie when they didn't really show anything of the town or any of its people, the first half of the movie could have been set in a different town for all I knew.|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell how he got here. As the story begins, it’s easy to assume that this is all a dream. In fact, this was a movie that was inspired by the HBO show “In Treatment” so that explains the flashbacks from one patient’s story to another’s. It was a little weird at first but it ended up being a very interesting movie. The acting was great, the special effects and scenery were great, and the dialogue was very natural and easy to listen to.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad , happy , surprised and even crying , all in just 1,5 hours . I have watched it few times since it was shown on TV last week. It is great to watch this movie and then have a discussion with your children about these important topics. I recommend this film to parents with kids 12 and up , but maybe you can watch it alone first . The film was made in 2012 , directed by a French director Mia Melle and was filmed in the French version .|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of the Kumbha Mela – the largest congregation in the world. The film features some 22500 extras from all over India, and is a journey that touches on the traditions, rituals and spirituality of India and the Kumbha Mela. The music for this film has been composed by legendary Indian music director, Hariharan. The music has been produced by Vibhavari Patel. This is one of the largest scale musical collaborations undertaken in recent years, with the participation of some of the best musicians and singers from across India.|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your interest ,and I think people will be very impressed with what Meryl did. She is a great talent . Meryl should definitely be up for an Emmy but the Academy isn't really a very big fan of dramatic performances in movies, unless they are lead actress performances in big budget movies. For a movie to get nominated for best movie, there has to be tons of big name actors and Meryl is not a household name, as far as most people are concerned.|0
"I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it too. And the music in this film was very 60's with a bit of country,
I had a few of the records but they were worn and scratchy but my parents had a lot of the sound tracks and I was able to record them. My dad had one of the guitars too but it was not from the show. There were 123 episodes made but some of them are missing , I will see if I can dig them out for the show."|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and beautifully shot giallo set pieces. Here is a film that can appeal to any horror film lover, gorehounds, and fans of the genre. The film starts off with a prologue detailing the murder of 21 year-old woman in a secluded forest. Her killer, a man wearing an ape costume, leaves no clues behind. We then flash ahead five years, to the present where the same woman is still haunting her killers nightmares, and he in turn is haunting the nightmare's of the town's other citizens.|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever, well-directed and well-scripted, “The Government Inspector” (the 19th-century equivalent of a 30-years war) does not disappoint. Although the story line is an updated version of Nikolai Gogol’s comic masterpiece “The Government Inspector” of the late 1830s, it remains unchanged in concept and tone. This is a fun show that pokes satire and fun at everything that has gone wrong in Russia (or what has gone wrong with Russia) and everything that is right about the Russian people and the Russian culture.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that this was easily one of the best films of the year and I’m really stunned no awards were handed out for this . Saoirse is amazing in the film and her character goes through so much development that she was completely engaging . It’s such a beautifully made film . The entire cast is really great and I would love to see all of these actresses again in films . This film is the perfect mix of drama, suspense, and mystery.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO show pages. I couldn't find who the artist is and if the image is still copyrighted but it looks like a good idea. I'm going to make it my own and use it in my designs but I'll give credit where credit is due. I think the artist is Jeffrey Wong and you can see his other stuff here. I found some of his work on his flickr profile too. A few of his other pieces I'd like to include.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar brawl , one of them is shot. He is saved and lives but the damage to the brain causes him to forget his previous life and to take on the characteristics of someone else's personality , a gangsta. Honestly I would not waste my time. It is a good movie that you will forget shortly after you watch it. I watched this movie in the cinema and I can't even remember what the heck was this about?|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch . Its an amazing story that I really enjoyed !!!!! This movie is one of a kind . The story is really good , but it kinda has a really dark side . I really liked the plot and the story . It is definately worth watching . I think that this movie should have been made more into a TV series as the ending is just a bit too quick . I loved the story . The whole idea of time travel is really interesting .|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a trend these days among many of the networks ... or perhaps among certain producers/directors ... that if any movie can be made as controversial as possible, they will succeed in attracting some viewers. I guess it's safe to say that this tendency will only grow stronger as more of the younger generation becomes TV watchers. As an example, here's an excerpt from a 1-1/2 page article about a new movie that will be airing on The Weather Channel.|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
"When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would make me cry in theaters. Not because I'm a heartless brat, but because I don't like feeling sad when watching a movie. Of course, I broke that promise to myself. I saw ""The Book of Eli"" last year. I cried so much that when my eyes wouldn't dry up, I had to leave my seat to dry them off. I'm still trying not to watch sad movies, but this week I realized that I would have to watch them in the future."|0
"I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind. I still get shivers and goosebumps at the end of a good one. My all time favorites are probably the 2 part episode where some scientists on a moon base accidentally unleash a virus from an alien artifact that takes over people's brains and make them want to kill. The scientists then try to stop it. Also the episode that I just recently watched ""Nightmare As a Child"". It is the story of an 11 year old girl whose dreams come to life."|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight, you were just fantastic! I cried and laughed my socks off! You were truly hilarious. And what's even funnier is that you look so much like Dwight from the Office (American version) . If you don't know who that is, just google it! And yes, I'm going to go watch it 10 times more again! Anyway, that was just one of the many brilliant moments in the movie for me.|0
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys who are looking for Lori , Rick and Glenn decide to split the party into 2 , the others will continue on the highway , the others will search the nearby buildings . So they are 6 people on the highway and 10 on the building . If you look at the first picture , you see Rick , Lori , Glenn , Maggie , Glenn 's wife , Michonne , the little girl . The rest of them is 6 . The rest of them has to be in the building .|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Together they have so much fun! This movie is really good and I recommend it. This movie was so good!!!!!!! It is about a family that went on a trip and then one of the brothers went missing but then he found him again and his brothers were sooooo happy that he was back!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best movie you will ever watch in your life!!!!|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Noble) who falls in love with a boy named Kay, they become engaged, but Gerda's father disapproves because the boy Kay is an orphan so he sends his daughter to school in the country with his mother. When she arrives at the country place, she meets a lot of new friends, one being Olga , played by the beautiful Debra Paget, Olga was supposed to be Gerda's maid but she really is a witch who wants Gerda to steal the snow queen's mirror so Olga can become queen.|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly serviceable mystery that will be entertaining for fans of the genre . The acting is good , but does not transcend the genre . All in all , it is an entertaining and competent film that should satisfy most fans of the genre . The story of a group of friends who decide to go to a small island for vacation , but things turn out to be different than they had imagined , in which a group of young people decide to spend the vacation in a remote Caribbean island .|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a young Albanian man from Prishtina, who had moved to Italy, in search for an economic opportunity, to provide his family a decent life. The Romanian man has been arrested, while the victim’s parents are now waiting for the funeral and to bury their only son. On the day of the funeral, the Italian authorities will decide whether or not to send the killer to Italy, where he was arrested or to Albania, where he is a national.|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially, you will have to watch it ! It is the 1945 movie by the French director Jacques Tati starring herself, Mme Tatischeff. It is about a widow and mother of three daughters. The movie begins with the death of her husband. She lives in a big house in a small town. She can't take her daughters to live in Paris. She had to move to a studio in a small room in the outskirts. She has to find a place to work.|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - not bad for a Hallmark film. Jason Priestley directs and stars in this film along with Emily Tennant as a young Canadian nurse with an interest in photography who joins the American Army in WWII. Jason is a nurse who is a great photographer and also a great doctor, but he needs to shake off the fear of his first time at the front lines in WWII, when he was shot, and the memory of that experience is holding him back from his new life.|0
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really that great to begin with. The story is a bit of a let down but it still delivers enough to keep me entertained. I've always felt that this was the second best of the Childs sequels. I feel that the first was better than the second but it still delivered enough to make me enjoy it. The problem with the first was that it tried to be a `` horror movie '' and a comedy and as a result it was not scary at all.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the whole notion of a young child being raised in a forest by a wolf a quite horrifying one . As I've grown older, I've grown to have a much more nuanced understanding of this story. I still find the concept of a wolf raising a human child to be a strange one & I certainly find the idea of a wolf eating humans a disturbing one . However , I now see that the tale is much deeper than just about a child & wolf.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing', which tells the true story of Luke, who is a young gay boy from an Irish Travelling community. Luke is determined to get out of his rural village and move on to bigger and better things. As a talented dancer Luke is accepted into an elite ballet academy in Dublin and this gives him a chance of a different life. His family doesn't approve of Luke being gay and his father, in particular, struggles with Luke being away from his home village.|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a film. The script is well paced, the acting is good, the pacing is excellent and the film is a real thrill-a-minute in the tradition of the great thrillers of the fifties - Hitchcock, Hawkes, Lang, Powell etc. Based loosely on the case of Abu Jundal and many of his associates, this is a thrill-a-minute drama that gets your adrenalin rushing from beginning to end. Excellent. The cast is top class, with Ajay Devgn as the upright, honest policeman and Emraan Hashmi playing the rogue.|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is this movie I have been searching for months . I was just wondering if anyone know if this movie is ever going to be released on DVD? Several people have asked for this movie to be released to DVD for years and we have no plans at the present time. The film was a box office success, but not as huge as many people thought it would be. I just found the movie at a local video store for sale.|0
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the sound track . And I'm a white 50 year old female . I don't know if the movie is about a girl or a woman but its about her coming out from under the control of her father , and that I can relate to . I saw this movie when it first aired and I was about 19 at the time. I loved it. Now I've just bought it. It's so well done and the music is excellent.|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I have watched it about 300 times in the last month or so... It is sooooo funny ! ! ! ! ! It's a wonderful, happy, funny, family movie ! It always puts a smile on my face. I want to go see the sequel that is coming out next year. I love the actors and all the characters in it and all the songs. The only down side is I want to live in a movie like the one in this movie.|0
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' ending where a character that had not been seen throughout the movie suddenly reveals the solution to the mystery at the end, with the protagonist in the role of an anti-hero or anti-heroine (a woman who was not a conventional female lead in that era). These films also focus on the seamy side of post-World War II America, a time of transition from an earlier, more moral era to one marked by an increase in corruption, cynicism, and violence, especially in gangster and detective films.|0
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every other frame be gratuitously sexual . And it’s all in service of telling a good story with good characters . If you’ve never seen it , you should give it a shot , it’s streaming on Netflix , I think , and it’s one of the best romantic movies out there . And , I mean , it’s funny . I just love the movie . It never gets old . And this is all I’ll say about it .|0
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more subdued films made in the 20's. I'm not entirely sure how this film is a comedy. I guess the idea of Chaplin being a tramp that falls for a lady is supposed to be funny. I found this movie very boring, unfunny and just plain odd. There is a subplot about some gangsters trying to make off with a diamond ring, but there's not even the slightest bit of tension or drama in the scene. In fact there's nothing going on at all.|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another run-of-the-mill cop flick, but in fact it is a rather ambitious attempt at a psychological action film. Jerry ( Bronson ) is an alcoholic who works as a bartender on a cargo ship. He takes care of a small boy who is being cared for by his mother who is dying of cancer. When they arrive in San Francisco, the boy is kidnapped by a group of drug dealers , and the mother goes underground to look for the boy.|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you would like a well written , well acted movie that you can take your grandchildren to see , this is a good bet . We were not disappointed . Violent and graphic but the story was well done. There were plenty of chances for the characters to get out of their difficult situation, but the writers chose to stick with the drama instead. I think that was the best decision. I enjoyed this film. Good movie, good plot.|0
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would. I expected to like it, but the previews for this movie looked kind of silly and the movie was going to be released with no buzz. But, I should never have underestimated this movie. The actors in it are wonderful, the story line was very moving and the message was great. It is about people who are different, but who are not. We're all alike and yet we're all different, but at our core we are one.|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times. I also felt very sad for the characters who never really felt a sense of peace. Never seen this one. I'll have to make sure I check it out. Thanks for introducing me to something new! My husband loved this movie so I am going to watch it soon. Thanks for sharing the giveaway!! I love this movie. I actually watched it when I was a little girl with my mother. I had never noticed the title before.|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns and girls ! The music and the choreography are amazing ! If you are a fan of movies like Flash Dance, 16 Candles, and the Karate Kid.. then you'll love this. I had the opportunity to watch it again on cable recently and my family and I all loved it again ! My 17 year old brother and I love it when we're bored. We just put it in, crank up the music and go for a ride.|0
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This 1942 short was released just a few months after America declared war against Japan. The short, which is just under 30 minutes, is a satire of Hitler and the Axis powers. It features Chaplin dressed in drag as the Kaiser, and doing his best Adolph impression. As usual, it was a box-office success, although it's been pulled from rotation by the Chaplin Family. They claim that he was too old to do the stunts and that he had a bad accident while doing them.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . The animation and characters really make this movie look great . The movie takes place in a fictional version of Tokyo, where the Japanese are ruled by aliens named Zentradi, and a race of beings called the Newtypes, who can control and understand machines like Zentradi. This time we see the story of a young boy, Brother Ixis , who was taken to the capital of the human world by his sister , and they become part of a resistance movement that seeks to drive out alien colonizers .|0
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is our go-to movie when it is time for the kids to be in bed. They have been watching AristoCats on Netflix for months now and I was pleasantly surprised with how much my daughter has retained about the movie. I was excited when I heard about a new movie coming out next year! It is titled, “AristaCats Kitty Kitty Boots”. Here is the description and trailer from the studio. The movie will be available for digital download March 17th and for DVD April 7th.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really make sense in the big picture. The writers of this show seem to do better with the psychological aspect of it rather than the detective story aspect of it. When I first saw this show I would have rated it lower, but now I think it's an above average show in the series. As the series progressed it did become a bit better than this. The story revolves around the kidnap and ransom of a scientist.|0
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original boy band , but those 1960’s TV episodes are the best . I have a big collection of their music on vinyl , and if I had a chance to do a concert series , I’d want them on it , but they’re not the kind of people who would accept . They never toured , even as the Monkees were very big in the early 60’s . They did reunions here and there , but never a proper tour .|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name (1976, directed by Shyam Benegal, 120 min.). The film was a major influence on later Indian films, and is considered a classic. It won the Filmfare Critics Best Film Award (1977), and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. The film's main character is named Hari, a middle-class, educated, Hindi-speaking Maharashtrian. Hari's wife's name is Om (the same as the greeting, as seen in the title).|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen many ! She portrays Lizzie so perfectly, and I wish she could have been given a bit more to do , but the movie just didn't allow it , as it was so rushed . I don't agree with the movie's assessment of what kind of woman she was . Lizzie was a real person, and I have read about her life . The movie shows her as a ditz , which she certainly was not.|0
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
"The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . The main thing in the film is its great cast of actors , which includes famous actors such as: Benicio Del Toro ,""Clive Owen"" and also features the likes of: Carla Gugino, and Paul Walker . The story is very well written and is filled with some great twists and turns , some of which you may not expect. I don't want to spoil the plot of the movie but I will tell you it's a really good one."|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had in the beginning. His Dad was a very private person . It is a little odd in some ways to have seen the film made by a son, a very well-regarded architect, and yet his Dad was very reluctant to be interviewed, and didn’t answer the questions that he was given. I am left with many questions myself. I was struck by the fact that there was very little in this film that dealt with modern art and its relation to Judaism.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
"The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World ( America ) told in three acts and set against the background of an America that has been changed by immigration in ways that the immigrants themselves never imagined. The play is concerned with the dreams and ambitions of those who come to America in search of the ""golden door"" that opens the world for them. This is a beautiful production of a lovely classic that should not be missed. Please note: This play contains adult themes and subject matter."|0
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I am so glad it 's on Netflix now ) and it 's so funny and I 've watched it with my parents and we all laughed at the end . I 'm 9 and I 'm on grade 4 and I think I should write a review on this comedy because it's so great that I should tell people to watch it . This comedy really shows you what is the real definition of family. What I liked about this movie was that it 's such a great comedy and you can relate to it.|0
"As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I can't even begin to explain . But hey, he 's got to get paid and I hope he is able to get his life back on track, whatever that is. http://news.sky.com/story/tweety-mack-found-wife-dead-with-two-guns-in-his-hands-10809325
It's not hard to make sense of it when you see it on the news, so why would one have to be a genius to find out? I have a friend that went through this and I am pretty sure he's a genius."|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was really looking forward to the new show. I watched the premier last Monday night. After a little bit I started to get a bit uncomfortable . Rachael was being so mean to the contestants. The show is still in the test run phase, so let's see what they do with it . I guess it was a bad night, but it was not good. I've seen Rachael's other shows, and this is not her.|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the 1940's in America. The film takes place in Memphis and shows how the blacks in the city were treated back in the early 40's, when it was still segregated. In the film there is a man name Mr. Turner who owns a grocery store. Mr. Turner is a very fair man who tries to please all of his customers and does everything he can to try and make things run as smoothly as possible for all of his customers.|0
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and Eddie Murphy ( Beverly Hills Cop , Vampire in Brooklyn ). When I was growing up, the two stars were always paired as comedy duos. Now they star together in a comedy. The premise of the film is that DeNiro plays a Broadway director of plays who wants to start a sitcom, so he decides to hire the most popular, famous comic on the scene to help him write the show and also be in it. Murphy fits the bill perfectly for that role.|0
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values of the movie are top class. But there's something about this movie that really makes it stand out from others like it and gives it a definite little something extra that keeps you interested throughout its entire playing time. You need to pay close attention to the movie though, because it will be gone in a flash. I really liked this movie, and even as I am writing this review, I find myself wanting to watch it again, just to experience it again for the first time.|0
"This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us on a journey through time and memory as the old woman recalls the events that led to her death and the life she's led throughout the decades. ""In my life, there have been two men. The one who loved me and then left me for good. And the other man who tried to kill me. Now, it's your turn."" The film is a masterpiece on all levels, with a beautiful, poignant story , and excellent acting by the two main characters."|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . I hope this show stays and has the chance to develop . I was a bit disappointed in the first epi but I liked it better in episode 2 and 3 . There are some very interesting plots being introduced . I hope it stays . Yeah, I think it's a good show. Not sure if I'll continue watching it, though. I just think I'd like it a lot better if it's not a 22 episodes show.|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it I was even more skeptical. It wasn't that bad, I thought it was entertaining but not good enough for more than one viewing, but I also thought the whole Paris thing was unnecessary and she was very untalented. The plot of the story is pretty simple, and it takes place over the course of 14 hours of the main characters life. It begins with two young lovers in the early hours of morning making out on a couch.|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . . . I think it is because it is so fun, and so much is going on that you can't look at any one thing. It is definitely a movie for the whole family. Here's a link to a fun clip of the film. What a great idea! I have never seen this movie. I will have to look for it. Have you ever seen the musical, ""Annie Get Your Gun?"" It is the best of both worlds."|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what fans are likely to expect . In short, the pilot is one of the more conventional episodes of this season . It was a decent episode, though the plot was not that interesting, and it just seems like it has to take place at least 2-3 episodes down the line if it wants to be effective. I really hope they get their shit together and get back into gear for the next episode, it was a huge let down after that epic second season premiere and first episode of this one.|0
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti , Placido Domingo or José Carreras , but it is still nice to hear them . In fact , I would say this was one of the best casts of the film adaptations of the three operas , and they did do a decent job . Especially in the scene where the tenor and baritone singers were singing the duet in front of the mirror , they sounded good , even if the music was a little off , which was probably because they sang it to the wrong song .|0
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
"If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933, she co-starred with Buster Keaton in Sherlock , Jr. as the long-suffering girl friend, who inevitably meets a bad end. (His girlfriend doesn't fare any better in this film.) If you've heard the old adage that ""behind every great man there's a great woman,"" then you'll recognize Keaton in this film as a man in search of his great woman. And Zasu Pitts certainly fits that description."|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to 3 minutes. The film's theme - the Beatles' A Day In the Life - is used in a similar manner to A Hard Day's Night. Great stuff - and even better that this was released at a time when so many of the big 1960s films have been 'revised' to fit in with the 'cool' '60s revival. As it stands, Head is both a fascinating cultural document from a unique era and also a damn funny film.|0
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some of the more recent films that came out after his accident in 1996 and his death in 1996. So I was pretty psyched to watch A Cat In The Brain last weekend . I really like it when a director releases a lot of films in a specific genre or in a style and Fulci did just that , he made a bunch of gory , violent Italian horror films that are among the most memorable and well-regarded films in the genre.|0
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like literature , make us reexamine our ideas of how we should live , how we should perceive our world , and what our obligations are . To me , this film is like a poem , a great poem . The first time I saw it , I was deeply moved . The second , the third, I was deeply moved again . The story takes place in an unnamed country that has just ended a bitter civil war that has ravaged its countryside , destroying villages , killing families , leaving people homeless .|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is about a high school senior named Aaron and how he copes with his life when his parents get divorced, his dad moves in with someone else and he has no social life. I don't want to give away the movie, but I can tell you Aaron wants to attend Harvard and has a chance at getting in, but it won't be easy as he must figure out his next steps. The movie stars Justin Long, Leslie Mann, Michael Angarano and Jonah Hill.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew being stranded on a desolate alien planet that's actually a huge space station. The episode was written by D.C. Fontana and was first aired on February 15th, 1967. Much to his annoyance, Captain Kirk is stuck with an assignment from Starfleet, one that he had wanted to get out of the moment the orders arrived. They are to rendezvous with a group of scientists who were to be observing a neutron star from a base on an asteroid.|0
"This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for star Gary Busey, who delivers the most outstanding performance I have seen him deliver since "" The Buddy Holly Story ,"" which I saw him in about 1977. Although Busey has starred in many good films, such as "" The Gunfight at the OK Corral ,"" and "" Buddy's Song ,"" and has played many outstanding roles, including that of LBJ, in "" LBJ ,"" Buddy Holly is probably the best performance I have ever seen him give on screen."|0
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , I must say , I liked this film . The director did a great job . I liked it . It 's one of those few movies that made me laugh from the first frame . The main characters are so funny ! I liked the story , the action , everything . What a great movie ! A must watch for every one ! Liked the plot but I wish there was some more development of the characters. I didn't find them interesting enough to really care for.|0
"This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but the sequel was still very good
Bruce Lee in The Big Boss 2 (1977)
I love this film so much and the soundtrack is very nice too. Bruce Lee was very talented actor but in his movies, he was too arrogant. In this movie there are a lot of great actors and the best of them all was Bruce Lee. I love this movie so much and there are many great actors and the main star was Bruce Lee."|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I really loved it. It had the right combination of comedy and drama which is not an easy task. The story was great and the people involved were perfect . I hope this movie has a big box office because it definitely deserves it. As a side note I also want to give my thanks to Billy Crystal , he is a comedy legend and he just continues to grow stronger. This is a wonderful family movie which I recommend to all families with children ages 9 and older .|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because he has done a lot of work to deserve to feel proud , but not enough of the right kind of work to merit the amount of respect he has gotten . Some of the things that have helped to make him famous, and to put him in the front rank as a song writer , a composer , a musician and a recording artist are the following . He is a talented song writer . His songs have been sung successfully by many singers , and at least a couple are in the public domain .|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is a case in point. This spoof of the Republic Of Ireland, centring on Puckoon village, and a war of independence between the Republic and Britain, has been filmed in both Ireland and England . The filming in Ireland will give a boost to tourism, and the Irish Film Industry. It is also being filmed in a village near us, and we were out for a walk, when we noticed that they were setting up outside our local village hall.|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to. This is not about a real story about a family. This is a fairy tale about a family, and if you go looking for something other than that you will be disappointed. This is a family story, and that's that. The movie is a little overrated because of the success of the book, and this is a fairy tale about the Grinch and his heart. What is the point of hating the movie for not being about real life?|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the very first. That would be the movie 1959. A comedy with a military subject that will not die. This movie had a great star in this movie with James Cagney who played the leader of a bunch of army recruits who will be under the command of Sgt. Vince Carter. This will be a funny movie that will be a very good movie that people will want to see over and over again with all the laughs that they will get from this movie .|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to it. A bunch of kids find an old video game cartridge in the wall of their new house, and play the game which turns out to be a murder mystery with a ghost involved. They must play to the end so they can beat the ghost or die trying. This is a 1984 movie that was made for $118,750 and made $21 million in the box office. Yes, you heard that right. A video game based movie from the late 80s that did really well.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
"I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this film at Cannes and it is a beautiful film, which is also very funny! I will definitely go see it again. Labels: Cannes, Hari Om
I can only agree that Hari Om is funny and beautiful, I love it!!! I've seen it more than 10 times now, I've never seen a movie that much in my life! So happy that you can finally talk about the movie, I thought it was a huge secret!"|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their appeal , but I never found his film making or storytelling that special or inventive ( or even good in places ). So when I was offered a copy of this film I figured it was time to see one of his earlier works . And it was only when I saw the film that I realised that this film is not a horror film but a giallo , a detective / thriller . So this review is for the 1976 release of Don't Torture A Duckling .|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is truly a must see movie with a great storyline. This movie is great for all ages, it will never let you down. I would strongly recommend to anybody out there that love movies to see this one, you will definitely regret it if you dont and if you do track down a copy and watch it now. Cheer up, This movie is not only very entertaining, it is going to be one of those all-time greats.|0
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me about her is her courage, her determination and her generosity of her spirit . I am not going to talk in details about each of these character features since it could take a long time . So I ll just say that she is a woman who never gives up and keeps her faith in herself no matter what . Even when her dreams seem impossible , she keeps fighting and trying to reach her goal . Ohwon s love for others is what makes her a great character in the novel .|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and cheerful songs . The music and songs are catchy and fresh, the young cast is great (and they sing too ! ), it's a story full of surprises , humour and emotion . All of it made me realize what a great talent this young artist was. I didn't know anything about his life , and what a short and sad one it was , but all of the actors do a great job making it all look so real and the film so enjoyable to watch.|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say I have never been so proud of an American Film in my life. I watched the film last Friday and have not stopped crying since. It has moved me more than any other film has in a long time. I want all my colleagues to see this film as soon as it is released so that they will understand what true artistry looks like. I think this is the film that everyone will be talking about for years to come.|0
"What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here are my expectations. I don't have any specific questions to ask because I haven't seen the film. But I would like to know what the producers are going to do for us ...
1 - We know that we can't have a season 8 before 10 years. If I remember correctly, we will have 8 hours for season 1 and 10 hours for season 2. This means 2 more years before season 3. And 2 more after that."|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : )
A boy, his father, and their dog struggle to make ends meet until the boy wins a radio call-in contest. Actor: Michael J. Fox, Kirk Cameron, Charles Martin Smith
Country: USA | Canada
Trailer: The Boy Who Loved Trolls
Movie 1: My Girl
In the 1950s small-town Missouri, a little boy befriends a mysterious, ill-tempered child who is rumored to be an evil witch. When the other children learn about the witch, they gang up and begin to torment the boy."|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do have a couple of the others, but nothing as spectacular . I was wondering, has anyone ever contacted the artist or anyone in his family? If you're not comfortable posting contact information, I would appreciate any information. This is absolutely beautiful, my favorite one of the three. I wish he had made even more. You're welcome, but the credit goes to him. I'm glad you enjoy them. This is an incredible film. I'm a fan!|0
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite his conscience? Will his faith in God triumph over the temptation to keep a sinful secret? This is the story of a Christian husband and his wife and how she discovers a dead body in their bed. The story is told from several different perspectives , the main one being from the perspective of a Christian wife. The novel is quite disturbing , and makes you wonder what you could do if your husband killed someone. Would you tell?|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I enjoyed it as much as I did in the theater. The movie was beautiful, the actors and actresses believable, it had a story line to it that kept me interested, and the scenery was magnificent. A lot of us who were around 20 or so at the time this film was released were just out of high school and going off to college, we were not that much older than the actors playing in the film. We identified with the story and the emotions the characters displayed.|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . I'm really disappointed because i wasted 2 hours of my life on this movie, i've been waiting for it since the first time i've heard that the movie is coming out but i didn't expect it to be such crap , i mean i didn't see it coming, i don't really know what happened but i was hoping for some action at least...but all what i saw in this movie was people talking..not a single action scene !|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people a bit squeamish but in the whole it had a very good script and it was very easy to watch. I thought that this movie was one that I could really recommend to people as it was just a great little movie. The story was good and the film was easy to watch . I really thought the acting was very good and in the end I was very happy with the film . I think that people would love this movie and that it would be one of their favorites.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it by accident while channel surfing and ended up sitting and watching the entire film in our living room. I am surprised that there has not been more talk of this movie on this website, which seems to focus on action and superhero movies. I have not seen The Dark Knight, but I know that it has a similar theme. But, as I stated before, this movie deals much more with the psychology of the criminals involved in the story than it deals with the Batman theme.|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with his trusty dog. In a nutshell: After being released from prison where he spent most of his time beating up fellow inmates and guard dogs, ex-con Mike ( Garlin ) is left to his own devices in Chicago, where he must face the real world alone for the first time. Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in this indie production in which he is joined by a supporting cast that includes John Malkovich, Anthony Anderson, Lonette McKee, Steve Little, Jake Johnson and many others.|0
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the problem people have is that the version of the book they read didn't match what they watched . If you watched the 1973 film `` The Last Shangri-la '' with Peter Sellers , you saw a film that didn't come anywhere near the plot of the book . It was just a romantic comedy , and nothing to do with the storyline at all . I liked the 2017 version of this . The plot was much closer to the book - it was much more interesting .|0
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,'' though less emotionally engaging. There's also less romance, but there is more sex, more brutality (both sexual and nonsexual) and more violence. It starts in 1909, in what remains of the British colony of Burma. A young British army doctor named John Flory , played by William Holden, goes to the front to tend the wounded. There he sees an animal that will become important to him: the Bengal leopard.|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I loved the way each show would leave me wondering what was really going on. I'm going to try to get my hands on some episodes . It's sad that it is no longer being aired on tv . I was also a big fan of that show, as were a lot of my friends back in grade school! It is a real shame that the show got cancelled, it was one of the most underrated shows that used to air, IMO.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock 'n' roll. In an age before MTV, bands had to work their craft to earn a spot on American Bandstand. This is the tale of a band of four men from a small town in Illinois who managed to break out and score a hit with ""Young Americans"". Of course, it's the classic tale of the rise and fall. This is also a good look into the music world of the late 50's through mid 60's."|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . . . . And yet, it is still very much a Paul Kersey film. While the film is not as horrifyingly violent, it is in many ways more violent than it's precursors. It's a film that takes the concept of revenge very seriously. There is one scene in particular that is very telling. While discussing the case of a child rape victim with the police, they ask Kersey what he would like to do to the rapist.|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available for purchase anywhere in the US, only for rent and only for streaming. I think it should be re-released because many of us that loved the movie would love to own a copy. Please, please get it re-issued for sale. I don't remember what the movie was about, but I remember being really excited that I got to buy a copy of this. It has great special features, it's worth it! I really enjoyed this movie, and the bonus features are great!|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a way that can be so unattractive when other people try to do it onscreen. This is a story of a relationship between an old man, a loner (Franco), and a troubled teenage girl (Sienna Miller). The movie is based on the novel by Haruki Murakami, who's a very popular Japanese writer. It's not his best, I have to say, but still an interesting movie that you can watch to learn something about Japanese culture or to get some inspiration for your own work.|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . I didn't remember much of it , so I can't really say whether the movie was an adaptation of the book and whether it kept true to its spirit and the original story. The movie is about a crazy inventor and his two associates who decide to build an artificial volcano to prove the existence of geysers in Iceland and to win a prize for it. The film is a lot of fun, a mixture of Jules Verne , steampunk , adventure , comedy and sci fi.|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door '). It is an incredibly powerful movie. It has everything that makes a great documentary; a story well told, beautiful cinematography (the scenes at sea are breathtaking) and most of all, compelling and compassionate subjects. It is the story about a group of people who came to the U.S. from war torn Lebanon in hopes of finding the American dream. It is a story that is told so well that you forget that the movie is made up of reenactments.|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Phone '') and produced by exploitation legend Joe D’Amato ( who also directed ), “A Night of Sex and Horror '' is quite a departure from your average D’Amato film, and more of an attempt to recapture the atmosphere of his earlier gialli rather than a full-on porno flick. In this film we have an evil landlord who turns his tenants out on the street to live in their cars in the middle of a rainstorm, when they refuse to pay their rent on time.|0
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! This movie is just amazing. The story line, acting, visual effects are all just perfect. The movie is a 3D animation that takes you on an amazing trip to a world that is completely different from what you have ever seen before (and that is saying something !). I was totally blown away by this. This is probably one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. I just came from the movies after seeing the sneak preview.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian cinema enthusiasts in the audience. It was definitely well received. Ritwik (Chandan Roy Sanyal), a middle class Bengali man, moves from India to New York in pursuit of his American dreams. While his friends and family are excited about the prospects of him moving to the ‘promised land’ of opportunities, he is torn apart by the prospects of having to start anew in a foreign land, without his family and friends, without his mother’s cooking and without the safety net of his extended family.|0
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that this one is not as good in quality as the other ones, so it is a bit hard to hear the characters in some scenes. Still, the fact that it is not as good as the other episodes does not deter from its amazingness, and I would definitely give this one a 4.25 out of 5 stars if I could (but I would not lower my rating to less than 4).|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic boundaries, and that all races will be exploited by big business, except the white race who is just too stupid to know their own best interests when they see it. It has been 25 years, and the film's message has not changed. It is also an excellent film noir in the tradition of Double Indemity and Laura. The acting is first class. The plotting is very tight. The pace is rapid but not too rapid for a 1947 film.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read this one when I was about 15, and it is still one of my favorite books. It has not been translated into English, and that is a pity. This is a book that should be available to as many young readers as possible, and it would certainly give an excellent introduction to Swedish literature. In this post I have included a brief summary (in Swedish) from a reader who reviewed the book on a Swedish book blog.|0
The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a lot of fun watching the movie. If you watch the movie just for the story , you're going to get bored by the movie. Its a great movie to watch if you like to watch movies that take place on a space shuttle . If you don't mind watching a silly movie with a predictable story then you will probably enjoy watching it. It's a fun movie to watch if you like to watch movies on space shuttle .|0
"So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was not an award winner ? The answer is: not often. I do not mean the type of ""awards season"" films, of which the Oscars and BAFTA's are just a small subset. If they are made to suit the awards, then they are made to please a few critics, journalists and filmmakers (the Academy or BAFTA's) to please a few thousand people in the theater and a handful more in front of their TVs."|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! The movie has a great storyline that is a great mix between horror, action, fun and drama. The story takes place in real life where the killer doll has returned. Charlie is back in this movie and we can see that the creators have really thought out his storyline. This movie will make you laugh at times, it's a lot of fun to be with this doll - you just can't do anything else than laughing.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of the DVD. The film tells the story about a lawyer who wants to be the next district attorney. Because he's too young for the job , he tries to get the job by using his sister's case in order to prove that he's able to solve this case. The movie takes place in a small town, where everybody knows everybody's business and you don't want to be found with your pants down. The story is well-written and kept my attention.|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about his hometown Mississippi. But he is also famous for writing about the American Civil War. Faulkner was a Southern writer and he did not like the North in his time. He lived a very interesting life. When Faulkner was six years old, his family lived in Oxford. They had to leave because of an epidemic of yellow fever. Later on, the family returned to Oxford, Mississippi, where he was born. The Faulkner family had some money.|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is such a fantastic actor . I am so glad that I discovered this show and I have to say that I have never laughed so hard and so much as when watching it . If you have not discovered this series yet then watch it , you will not be disappointed , this show is very funny. Amazing show! I loved it since the first season, but this one is my favourite! The cast is fantastic and the script is great.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie network on November 22, 2018. I love all the actors and actresses that played their parts. I am so glad that the story was told. I can’t wait to watch more movies and I hope that this will make a good movie series. Keep them coming please. I taped this on the LMN channel and watched it on the Lifetime Movie Network on November 16, 2018 and I was very pleased that it was on Lifetime Movies Network.|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this movie. This was an interesting film to me, not only because I like the director, but I think it was very well done. The story line was cleverly done. It has a nice blend of comedy and suspense. In fact, I thought the director should have been a man. It was difficult to get past a man playing a woman, but this actress nailed it! It was almost creepy in a good way, how believable she was.|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , it was always a dream to make movies like this and we've seen a lot of really bad films as a result but it was always a great pleasure to see films like SCREAM, HALLOWEEN H2O or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT . THE CALLING was my second movie and it had a budget of 500 thousand dollars, it was shot in three weeks and the biggest challenge was that the film took place entirely inside a 120 square metre apartment , with two actors .|0
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I just saw on her site that she did an interview with Oprah , which is so cool ! She's my favorite celebrity out there today . She just seems so genuine , and down to earth , not to mention , she's gorgeous ! Here is a recipe I'd like to share with my readers . I've been working on it for quite sometime . I have it down now , and I'll be making it soon to take to my next party .|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as the Chucky puppet singing ""The Final Countdown"". I laughed all the way through. This movie is the best one in the series! Chucky's Back! Chucky returns for a new round of mayhem. Chucky is one of the best-known killers ever put on film, and one of the most popular. This time around, Chucky is given a much better story than in the original 1990 release of the original Child's Play, and the rest of the series."|0
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does try very hard to be funny . The movie tries very hard at times to be funny but comes off more than just annoying. The cast does do a good job, but I think that the main reason to see this movie is to enjoy the cameos, which I did not do. In the end I can recommend that you rent it, or wait for it to hit cable, but I would not suggest paying the full ticket price at a movie theater for this movie.|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the other films in the series, but I just love the series. This is a good movie, and I really love it. I love the story of the movie, I love the cast, I love the character, I love everything about the film. This movie is very interesting, and I like that. The film is good, and it 's definitely worth checking out. A great movie, and this is the kind of stuff you 'll rarely see in movies these days.|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who is 10 years to the day younger than me who plays the guitar and does an Irish Dance and a girl who has the most beautiful voice in the world who plays the ukelele . This is the first episode and there is more on the way . It’s all about the music but there is some great talent out there . This show was filmed in NYC in the fall of 2009 and is hosted by Matthew Broderick .|0
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not there was no cursing at all . The movie was about the struggle of one man to make the world a better place . He didn't just want change he needed it . He wasn't just the leader he was also the heart and soul of what the march was all about . The movie is about the life of Dr. King but it's not just for black people only . We all need to know the struggle's and the sacrifices that people made for our freedoms .|0
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself . It tells us about the life of the Ancient Egyptians and how they used their knowledge and how smart they are , which made them create those great monuments that exist up till now. it is very interesting, even though the Egyptians weren't very accurate with what they were depicted in the movie. It was awesome. i loved it and i can't wait till it comes out! it is really cool,and the movie is awesome!|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and dance floor showgirl, Lana always resisted doing it on film until her husband, Stephen Burton , persuaded her to do so in This Is the Night . It is the only time in her long career that we get to see how good she was. One of Lana 's biggest hits was a song recorded in 1971 called Tennessee Waltz . She was nominated for a Grammy, but the song lost out to a disco record by The Ohio Players, which was titled Lunatic Fringe .|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. In the following scene in a recording studio Buddy sits with his producer and record company manager as he is told he’ll never amount to anything unless he starts to sing with a country influence, to which he replies, and I quote, “If I’m not doing rock ‘n’ roll I might as well just shoot myself” and there the whole story begins. The Buddy Holly Story tells the story of what Buddy’s life was like up to the point where his career ended.|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it's a must for all to watch
Reviewed by james-jones 9 / 10
The Greatest of its kind. The Greatest Film EVER !!!! This is a film which should never have gone into the ground for so long before the world was able to witness this piece of pure comedic brilliance. This film is so good, it should be in the top 10 highest-rated films on IMDB, and should always be on any 'top ten' lists."|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a journey . The story follows him as he encounters a host of strange characters and creatures along the way. During the journey, Little Gus encounters a few friends and also enemies. He meets an old woman who offers him food , drinks and clothes. Little Gus then meets a witch, an ogre and a giant. But the most important and interesting character of the story is a talking cat. They start talking to each other.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
"Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i just can't wait for this film to come out here in the uk ! so excited !! i loved him as the older batman in the nolan trilogy. he was good in goodnight, and good luck. He was awesome in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" I can't wait for ""Robin Hood."" He's one of those people that I always think ""I'd like to know him, if I could""."|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. These were usually foreign films that you couldn’t find in the theater. The goal was to see as many as you could in the shortest amount of time, and they would have to be movies that none of us had any clue about. This was before the days of Google, so we had to do a lot of detective work, looking up film reviews and synopses, and then going to our local video store to rent these films.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life), they never seemed to leave, or maybe they did, and came back, but I don't remember that. I just know it's always summer out here for them. It's the best job ever. Now I'm not complaining ( I have a cranky 2.5 year-old son who is driving everyone around me insane today). I just find it hard to believe that this is the first time they've come to my town and filmed this particular movie.|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce more and better television shows in the independent marketplace? If you think about the sheer number of cable networks that are in existence (and the number is increasing), and the fact that they are spending a lot more money to produce these shows (and pay for them as well), I’m guessing the answer may be yes. In my mind, this trend has been in the works for years, as the proliferation of channels has been the norm for a decade or so now.|0
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements of a good suspense story and Columbo makes the most of it. The first part of this 1 hour 20 minute episode is set in a high-end New York restaurant.The camera does not linger unnecessarily on luxurious settings, which makes the episode doubly more realistic. It has a good murder mystery in the second half to keep the audience hooked.But the first half is the real draw of the episode because it contains one of the most gripping opening scenes of the entire series.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which I highly recommend you watch on Netflix , you learn a great deal about a man who lived most of his life in obscurity . He died broke , he had very few students , and his buildings while they look beautiful today , they were not very well received by most people during his lifetime . However , Kahn had a passion and he poured his entire being , his entire life into architecture and his passion shows through the beauty of many of his buildings.|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Bassett and Simon Callow. The film is set in a London apartment, where a murder is committed in the early hours of an August morning. Based on a novel by Keith Ridgway , the movie is filled with intriguing twists and turns. But, more than that, it is an exploration of the way we perceive events. The movie's title refers to the difference between what we think we know about the events and what the facts reveal in the days and weeks that follow a traumatic occurrence.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared , but this movie was so much better . If you have not seen it . I really enjoyed the ending of this movie, it was very unexpected. I'm usually not a fan of horror movies but this is one of the better ones. I thought the characters were developed and I was really into it. It's a must see if you're not a sissy! Very good movie, not as good as the first but still enjoyable!|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan , directed by J.P. McGowan and released in . This version is directed by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca ) from a script by Lenore Coffee and Ben Hecht (Scarface; The Front Page ). The film was the first collaboration between Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca; To Have And Have Not) and Edward G. Robinson (Key Largo; The Ten Commandments ). The film is set in 1919, a time of social upheaval and discontent.|0
"Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently was an actor/singer/musician. I wish I knew what he was up to these days so I could check him out. There's a link to the full version of the show here. You have to pay $1.50 to get it but if that's all you're after, go for it. If you want to watch all of it, however, you will need to pay $15 for a month-long membership to ""Blu-Jew""."|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in this movie. There are two basic reasons for this. Firstly, the interviews help the audience to understand and appreciate what the musicians are going through when they are on stage. And secondly it gives the audience a little more background to the band and what they have been through over the years. The interviews show the group as a family and it makes the viewers feel as though they are a part of it all.|0
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience has returned and he hallucinates about his past with Penelope, but she is now dead and he does not even remember her anymore. Sawyer and Jack try to convince him that Penelope is not real and to wake up, but he is completely entranced and does not want to. Jack then goes to Hurley to find out if they've been monitoring the radio transmissions, but he has not. When asked why Jack says that the transmissions have become too strange and that he doesn't believe that they can be trusted.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. The movie is a must see if you are not afraid to get a bit of laugh. This movie may not have been for the kiddies but they would love it also. If you don't have a sense of humor then you won't find this movie amusing. I have to say that the entire cast is outstanding. The movie will have you rolling in the aisles and the story will keep you interested till the last minute.|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the films 60 or 70 years down the line, and The Hurricane is no exception. The idea of a movie featuring a hurricane that lasts for several days with no electricity or water was a novelty in 1937 and still looks like one to most modern viewers who are used to hurricanes appearing in the first few minutes of a disaster flick, usually with a major city in the path, and vanishing again just as quickly.|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by both corruption and crime. The film centers around three murders of women, the victims of which all happen to have been found naked, strangled, and tortured. When local reporter Andrea (Andrea Allesandro) comes to investigate, he learns that there are those who might be interested in seeing justice served, but also others that might be more interested in silencing any potential scandal about their misdealings. This is the 10th film from the director, but the first to appear outside of the Italian horror genre.|0
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I loved how it was directed, the music was amazing ,the actors were excellent and the storyline was amazing. A lot of people are giving it bad reviews because of the plot, I think the plot was awesome, the characters are likeable and it really is one of the best action movies ever made. It was a really great movie, I love the way it was filmed and the actors were perfect for their roles. I really liked everything about it.|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be anywhere else. This is one of those movies where the actors really look the part they're playing and I believe that their personalities match those of their characters. It was also very funny, with great one liners. The ending is very sweet and I'm so glad that it worked out in the end. This is definitely worth a watch for anyone who is looking for a sweet movie. This is one of my favorite rom-coms of all time.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are captured by the camera are breathtaking ! I just can't stop looking at this ! A must watch for everyone ! I'll be watching this in a few hours.. I just hope this doesn't trigger a migraine I had this happen with a video last night. I just watched this in one sitting. It was amazing. It also made me very emotional. The imagery was beautiful, and this is one video I know I'll watch again.|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman´s Romeo&Juliet, for instance. And if you don’t like to see a sad story, well… just don’t watch it, simple as that. I´m sure it won’t ruin you as much as the last Harry Potter movie: it will just show you another face of love, as you’ve seen it before, only much worse. But you’ll like it, I am quite sure of that.|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series many times on TV and video. I will never forget the opening music of that series. In 1964, I was a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. It was the only TV station in town at the time which allowed students to buy time on the commercial-free educational channel. I got the time to do a weekly science-oriented program which was titled The Outer Limits. The show featured segments about space exploration, science news and science fiction films.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness '' and the inevitable reversion to the Iraqi-in-their-underpants theme of `` B-roll Iraq .'' One of these two films is an extraordinary documentary, and I have no idea which. If you think that you know the story of the Persian Gulf War , you are wrong . This film is not a documentary in the Michael Moore sense, and I can't really tell you how to react to it. That is, I think it's important and provocative, but not in any way I'd like.|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The story begins on a planet in which there was a nuclear war and now there are no other human beings living, but a small family . The story focuses on the relationship between the mother and her children , one of whom is an autistic little girl and the other is a very intelligent little boy . One day they discover that they are still surviving thanks to the technology of a spaceship that has come to them from an unknown planet .|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of the most funniest and hilarious movie I have seen in a long time . It had me laughing out loud the whole time, I can't say enough good things ! ! ! I'm not even gonna try. Great cast. Excellent script and directing. This movie has a special charm. The whole cast are so good. I recommend this movie. This is the kind of movie, which gains its popularity on word of mouth.|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster ride that I would recommend to anyone! The best part about this film is that it is a true story. As you watch this movie all your emotions are stirred. Ryan O ' Neal and John Hurt are excellent actors and they portray their characters brilliantly. Whenever I watch John Hurt I always think of his great performance in the 1981 film Chariot's. In 1991 he also won an Emmy Award for this role! Unconditional Love is about an elderly woman who has dementia.|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
"Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you are aware of the disgustingly racist character called ""Apu"" from The Simpsons. In the movie ""Ralph Breaks the Internet "" this character was featured . A few weeks ago, I was asked if I wanted to attend a special screening of this movie, so I said yes! It was a great movie. I liked all of the references that were placed in this movie and I really enjoyed it. It was hilarious. If you are planning on watching this movie , I highly recommend it."|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors prepare for the long-awaited rescue mission. But, as we've seen, that's no easy task, given that the survivors have no radio, there are no flares in the raft, nor is there a boat nearby. All this and more, as we continue with the survivor saga , and get a look at what's in store for the week to come, in ABC's drama series `` LOST ,'' on Thursday, April 26, 2007 at 9 pm., ET.|0
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when The Lion King came out. The second time was when Disney started to re-release some of their animated classics and put them on the same DVD as Lion King. The last time I watched it was when I purchased the 2-Disc Edition when it was released in September of this year. The reason why this is a 3 star movie and not 2 star is because it has a great story and an important message for today's youth.|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull face guy was so funny. The only downside is the limited amount of storyline and that it ends abruptly without any real conclusion. I'll be looking to watch this cartoon series again in the future. I have high hopes for it . If you enjoy adventure cartoons this cartoon was worth it for you. There are so many cartoon options nowadays, but I'm glad I chose to watch this one in particular. I would love to know what you guys thought of it.|0
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been boring ! ! ! ) I'm sorry you didn't win but hey, life goes on . Wishing you and your husband the very best in 2014 ! ! ! Hugs and God bless ! Good Luck to you, your husband & your daughter in 2014. Hope it will be better than 2013. Thank you for your kind words on my last post. Hope you have a good weekend ahead. Aww sorry to hear it went that way!|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched the internet and the local bookstores to find that particular book but could not find it in either bookstores or the interent . Can some one tell me what the title might be please ? Re: Searching for the title of a 1950's black and white film with a woman as a nurse. There are no credits in the film you are looking for. The best you could do is contact IMDb and ask if anyone there knows.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully crafted production of a simple story told with a minimum of dialogue and a maximum of mime and body language, and is one of the most memorable plays I have ever seen. Both the writing and acting are superb. The story involves a family that returns to the house in which a young daughter died many years ago. Their return brings back old memories and painful reminder of the past. I think that every family should see this play.|0
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother the Merciless Mother series, which aired on HBO in the late 1970's, any day now), it may have seemed like an unusual move to make a film on vinyl record and tape. It is certainly not the first such film (see the work of Andy Warhol), but there have not been that many that I can think of that have actually come out on such formats. There are a few out there, however.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is more of a self-deprecating slap in the face than what we get with most characters in this type of show. As a kid growing up in a house where there was little money and the parents had been brought up as working-class folk and as a result of the poverty and the struggle to pay bills they were quite tight and did not allow many luxuries (like a TV, which we got for my sisters wedding and which has been there ever since).|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had never seen it before, but we loved it so much he's bought two copies now! This is one of our all time favorite movies, it's one that we watch over and over again! The acting is superb, the story is great! You have to see it! I just loved this movie! My husband and I laughed so hard. I bought this one for my father for Christmas and we all enjoyed it. This was such a funny movie!|0
"I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been a film fan, there 's been talk about an English language version of ""Leon "" which is my all time favourite film of his. Unlike some of his other films ""Leon "" has never really had an American version made , it has been a constant source of discussion by film fans that Besson 's film should get an American remake , and I 'm sure there was one in the late 90 's that never saw the light of day ."|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best TOS episode. Kirk has the Enterprise in trouble. He has no way to communicate with any other Starship. He can't trust the local aliens at all because they may be a threat or spies. Scotty and his team are trapped on a planet and the away team that went to get them are gone. There is only 23 minutes of footage in the episode and it's a great tribute to the art of story telling in a science fiction show.|0
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD HAVE BEEN like this or that . However , what I 'm doing is to make a commentary on how I feel about the movie . Now , if I were to say this movie is great , that means I 'm a big fan of it . And if I say it s a good movie , that means , it's worth to be seen . And if I say it 's a mediocre movie , it means I don 't think it 's worth the money to see it .|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of change in our society as well as in ourselves. I liked the film, even though I didn’t like the main character at all. This is a film you’re likely to see again. A few months ago I read about a film festival and decided to look up some of the films on the website and see if any looked interesting. This is one of those films. It was nominated for the Short Film award at the festival.|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake about it : this is a question that the director wants you to think about seriously and deeply . This movie is not made to entertain you and give you the satisfaction of a happy ending. The film starts out by showing us that this guy , who is obviously one of the most powerful of the world , has lost everything . It makes no difference that he's still very rich and powerful , because his wife has left him .|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful romantic story. It is the first film in which Diane and Richard Gere worked together in 20 years. The story unfolds along the North Carolina shore where Diane Lane plays Marianne, an unmarried 38 year woman, working as a waitress to pay her bills and support her young daughter. She takes a job at an inn that is owned by Paul (Richard Gere), and they discover they have a lot in common. As they grow to know each other better, their friendship turns into something deeper.|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
