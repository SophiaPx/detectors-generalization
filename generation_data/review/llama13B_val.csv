Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three railroad workers and left a dead body behind at the murder site. This time around the bandits' horses have been dressed in the uniform of the local Indian tribe and the murder scene has been left behind in that manner, so the Lone Ranger & Tonto are pretty certain that they are being framed. The Lone Ranger asks around and the ranch hands claim that the murdered man was no friend of the ranchers and was likely murdered because he was drunk and abusive.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all do a great job at making this movie great ! The characters are believable ! The action and effects are awesome ! The story line is good , not to short and not too long ! I am a very picky movie watcher and I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody , you wont be disappointed ! I loved it and I know you will too ! An interesting storyline, great acting. I enjoyed the story line, I thought the movie was very funny and had a good cast of characters.|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals in Europe and was nominated by the French Academy (Cesar Award) for best female newcomer , best director and best screenplay . It was a very personal film for Cedric . Cedric has been living in Barcelona for more than 2 years. He was looking for an apartment and asked for a help to a friend who worked in an advertising agency . She told him to come for an interview. It took only 1 minute to get the job!|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary, the leading actress, the director, the author and two other characters all talk about the play which the audience cannot hear. It's about a young girl who wants to be a painter but the father insists that she become a writer. They all try to explain what the play means but disagree on the meaning. There is no resolution but it's quite interesting and very funny. A good play to study.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as we are in the middle of real people , real characters that are very well played by actors that look the part , act the part and are very well cast in their roles . This film has heart , emotion , humour , drama , excitement and a story that will grip the viewer and keep them involved the entire run time . This film was recommended to me by a good friend of mine who knew I had been wanting to watch a good western film and this was certainly recommended to me .|0
"I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of Terror Train. I saw it once in the theater but I think it's about 28 years or so ago. The picture quality is better than I remember, I think because I had forgotten how ""dark"" a lot of it looks and I think that was the intent. The acting is good although I never thought Jamie Lee's acting was very convincing but I liked her anyhow. I have a friend that says he wants to see it one last time before he sells it."|0
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few ) probably watched the first 5 or 6 episodes and got turned off by the cheesy acting. This is true, there was a period where it felt like high school theater at times. But after a few episodes they get over it and forget about it and move on to the next episode. This show is a great mix of politics and comedy. It’s a show about two people who have very different opinions and try to make a living.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Vinnie to get his younger sister out of prostitution, run by his gangster uncle and his mobster associates. He’s trying to raise $12000 to get her out of trouble, and in his efforts Vinnie gets involved in some very dangerous people, including an Asian gang boss who’s looking to set up his drug operation in Sydney. The stakes get higher and higher and the danger increases as the movie proceeds, all leading to an explosive finish in a hotel room in the heart of the city….|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd say the best thing to do is just forget it ever happened . For example , I really did enjoy the scenes where we met the characters from the first film . They were great fun and a great way to keep the film going at a fairly decent pace . I just wish that they could have included more of that humour in the rest of the story . I think the biggest problem with this second film is that there's nothing new .|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way as this one has. It moves and grips because the protagonist is so compelling. You want to know her and understand her, but she doesn't make it easy, she resists. But you want her anyway. That's because she's played by Michelle Williams, who in this film has given the performance of her career so far. She does that thing actors do that's so impressive it's almost invisible, which is to inhabit the character completely so that we are watching a real person.|0
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a strong, unwavering lead performance from the late Patrick McGoohan, this made-for-TV science-fiction / fantasy movie, based on a novel by Alan Nourse, is better than you would think it is, considering that it was made in 1969, the first year of NBC's famous Saturday-evening movie of the week. It may not be a great movie, but it is a solid, entertaining little movie that has some genuine suspense at the beginning and in the latter half and a pretty good sense of wonder, too.|0
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most profitable and artistically important eras for the studio. This is true not only for MGM, but for the entire genre of animation as a whole, as Avery brought to the art form a whole new level of sophisticated humor, surreal gags and sly references that were unprecedented in popular culture. His most famous and influential creations were Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, along with a host of hilarious sidekicks and baddies including Tweety Bird, Foghorn Leghorn, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Pepé le Pew and The Roadrunner.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being woken by his secretary ( Lona Andre ), who has a telegram telling him that a young star has broken her leg and wants the producer to see her at his hospital bed. The producer reluctantly agrees and drives over to the hospital, where he sees the injured actress and decides to offer her a new play that he’s been developing. The play is a farce about a wealthy old man, played by Leon Errol, who falls for his granddaughter ( Marcia Mae Jones ).|0
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in theaters. It was good. But this was an excellent movie . I cried at the end . Amazing film . The music was fantastic. I had no knowledge of this man's life and had no expectations . But I was not disappointed . It is a true story . Beautiful film and a great cast. I was not expecting to be so moved. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in WW II or the artistic side of the War.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have been searching a while and have not found anything. I just recently bought this movie, but I'm having a really hard time finding this scene. I think it's only on the DVD. Anyone have this scene? This is my favorite scene in the whole movie. I've heard that it's on a DVD somewhere but haven't seen it yet. It would be great to be able to buy it. I can't stop thinking about it.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is one of the most fascinating and interesting histories. One can find many reasons for this statement, starting from the discovery of New World, passing through the American and French Revolutions and ending with the American Civil War. The main point of this essay is a review of the book by Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell and a discussion of her interpretation of American history during the period of 1861-1870. The discovery of America was the first and the most significant step in the history of North and South.|0
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 or five times since. It is a movie you can watch again and again and get something new out of it each time. I don 't know if I'm the only one but I 'm always trying to guess where the movie is going and every time i'm surprised. It is a movie about love and trust and how you can learn from the worst mistakes in your life. I never expected to see this on this list. I am glad to see it is.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I'm very glad I bought it because she is beautiful. The story was pretty good for a 50's movie. It was so much fun watching it. I will be buying more 50's movies in the future because of her. I also liked the fact that this was a family friendly movie. So if you love her too then you will love this movie. I really enjoyed this movie! It brought back memories of my grandma, who passed away many years ago.|0
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just a chick show. and then someone gave me a tape with some episodes on it as a present. i did not know any of the girls and i only watched because a friend wanted to watch something together with me. it took 4 episodes and i was in love. my husband thought that was strange but i was hooked. and then the series was taken off the tv because they thought they would not have enough audience. and so i watched all the rest on video.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in the international press. The film of Cedric Kahn will be screened at the Viennale, the international film festival of Vienna on November 3rd. The program is also announced for this important festival, with 300 films in competition (170 of them world premieres), and around 2500 international professionals expected. This is the first time that one of Cedric's films is screened in Austria. It will be shown at 9 pm, in the Imperial cinema (Kino Imperial).|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in my opinion , and the only game in the genre I’m still playing right now. Wasn’t aware of this one, but it sounds interesting. It’s a mobile game, huh? Not sure if I’ll get around to it, but it sounds like something I might enjoy. Certainly not a bad looking game and I agree that the combat looks solid, but I’ll still probably pass on it until it goes on sale or a price drop comes.|0
"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and clever then and still is now. The message is relevant, too: we need to look beyond ourselves, to think about how our actions affect the lives and world around us. A good lesson for all. A classic, for sure! I hadn't really noticed it when it was originally printed, but as I look back now I'm seeing that it's very much akin to ""The Ant And The Grasshopper"" (that's the Aesop's Fable, right?)"|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , perhaps 10 years or so ). There is not much to say about the gameplay , but the puzzles ( not too difficult ) were pretty cool . The story , though , had no surprises and no twists in it . Perhaps you should play it anyway ! A great story, a great puzzles and a very good music makes this game really worthy of our time. I liked it very much, but it was just too short for me.|0
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a big a hit it became and how not a big fan following it has . Throughout the 1980s and '90s , a lot of horror films have come out that i have enjoyed and still do but there are certain movies which i have enjoyed more than the rest . For me it has to do with a lot of things , for one the mood and atmosphere of the movie is very important and so is the music , the characters that you care about and the story and also the scares .|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated as much then and that was what I liked about it, the raw emotions that were expressed. Jake LaMotta is the only fighter who's managed to go from being a beloved hero to a reviled villain. The Bronx Bull stars William Forsyth as LaMotta, a former middleweight boxing champ whose bouts were the stuff of legend. But as time went on, LaMotta's personal life became just as famous as his ring exploits, thanks to his increasingly erratic behavior.|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
"SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going ON. I love it, but I am sure I'll grow tired of it soon. Anyone know if it'll be on anytime soon? I've got to see this one again! ""The world isn't good or bad; it simply is. You make it your own."" I saw this yesterday in a sneek preview, and I really like it! It has a very dark tone to it, but the ending is really cool."|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's The Hair Bear Bunch. UPA made their cartoons a little different from most of the other animation houses. When the animation studios came together as United Productions of America, They created a new look and style for cartoons, one that made their cartoons much more different than the competition. In this post we 'll take a look at the history of the studio that would bring us The Hair Bear Bunch and a bunch of other memorable cartoons.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1

"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad the reviews are or what kind of a budget it had. I'm just that much a fan of all his work so far. His debut film as director, ""Blade of Glory,"" is a great movie. It's not as good as his third film, ""Hustle and Flow"", but it's just as good as his second film. The acting is very good, the music great (I've since bought a copy of that soundtrack myself), and the story is well-told."|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started with Friday the 13th, but by the time that film was in it's fourth outing, there were a number of films to choose from for your fix of stalking and killing. It's a sub-genre that doesn't get near the respect as other horror sub-genres (giallo, zombies, vampires) but they had a good run in the mid-eighties. Just Before Dawn fits in perfectly with this sub-genre. It stars a group of college-aged campers on a camping trip.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and a producer asks them to sing a certain song together. The producer wants them to sing in perfect unison. It is as though they are being asked to sing the same song at the same time. The two Karens are sitting across from one another in the control room, each on a different side of a window. The producer starts to conduct them in the song, and it is clear that he is not asking one Carpenters Karen to sing in harmony with the other.|0
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's predictable , but not in a sickeningly cynical way . It 's a movie to watch on an airplane or when you have a flu and want to be transported by something light , without being pummeled by special effects and explosions . It is an innocent , sweet movie and very charming . Good for those who want a break from the usual Hollywood drivel and who have grown weary of super hero movies ( which are all basically the same , just a different hero each time) .|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning . The actors gave amazing performances . One of my favorites . 10/10 for sure . Violence: This is a movie about war , so expect a lot of blood , war scenes . I really enjoyed the first movie and I think I may have liked the second one better. This one has so many funny lines. I just watched this last night and still laughing this morning at some parts. A very entertaining movie that you will not want to miss.|0
"`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory, funny , original and strange . This is not a serious movie, but a very very funny movie with some good effects and good make-up . Lots of gore , funny scenes , and very weird . A must for all horror fans and Full Moon Fans!

I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying horror movies with a bad reputation. Maybe because they are cheap at the local library (2 dollars for three weeks, if you like the DVD you buy it, otherwise you bring it back and get the next one). It's a very good thriller, but not at all frightening. The setting in the woods is the best thing about it, the characters are very interesting and the plot is original and exciting. You will have a hard time guessing what is going on.|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield.

The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort in what could be considered a career-defining role . The cast is superb all round , with a great villain , in the form of Tony Todd , as well as some great support from Vinnie Jones. The action is top notch and there's some great gun-play and some great kills in this . If you love a gritty , dark urban action flick - this is definitely for you . It's got a great plot , the characters are great , the acting is great , the stunt-work and the action is great .|0
"I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , lame title - it is not luck at all - the film is not lucky). Anyway, the film is great and is full of all sorts of fascinating little facts and information that I did not realise. One of my favourite characters is the old man who drives an ice cream van through the centre of town with a sign on the roof saying:
FULL FLAVOUR FREEZES AND CREAMS TO BEAT THE HEAT. This is what he is trying to do but he cannot keep up with the weather."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks ago. They are completely different shows, and I ` ve been trying to figure out just why they are so different. Of course, there ` s the obvious differences in the directors and actors and the music, but I think the script is where the real differences lie, as well as the way the characters are seen. The first version has an innocence and sweetness about it, while the second is harder in tone and has a sense of loss and despair.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry pictures. In this, with Joanne Dru and Ward Bond , a group of pioneers head out West. The picture is not about Indians. It is about the hardships of getting there and the hardships of life out there. But Ford has such a feeling for horses and for these pioneers that what he shows is good entertainment , and good fun to watch. He has a special interest in Ward Bond and he makes a special picture of him and his horse, a very large, gentle horse.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the Christmas holiday. As for my 4th grade son, he couldn't wait to tell me the story he heard in school. A good movie if you're looking for something light, funny, and not too deep. I would watch this movie again. This was a really cute movie. You don't have to know history to appreciate this film. There are lots of funny jokes, great costumes and good acting. I would recommend this film for people who are looking for something to lift them up.|0
"I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic, fun, and beautiful show, and you can see that everyone who works on it is really passionate and loves their job.

I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I have never been able to sit through it since. I don't remember much about the movie, but I do remember the scene where the priest dies. I just couldn't get over that ending. I can still remember seeing the priest in the coffin, blood coming out of the corner of his mouth. I think I had a nightmare or two about it. If you're looking for some great 80s camp, this is your movie.|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with this urban-thriller that is even better. After serving 10-years in jail for a murder that he committed when he was 16, a former street hustler (Stanley Tucci) returns home with hopes of starting a legitimate business and leading a normal life. Upon his release, his younger brother is killed in a drug-dealing deal gone bad. Fueled by the anger that he has endured, Tucci goes on a murderous killing spree in order to get revenge for his brother.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. If you enjoy historical movies , that capture the very soul of the characters involved, this is without a doubt , a movie not to be missed . There are so many reasons for enjoying this film . The costumes and set , as well as, the actors and actresses all lend themselves to the film as a whole . I certainly hope to see this movie on DVD , and look forward to buying it . It is a must to see and own.|0
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply the best thing I have ever been too. The sound and lighting are sooo good, it's amazing to think of the amount of work involved in putting on a show this good. I was in the fourth row from the stage and it looked like I was sat in Geddy's lap for the entire show. It's always nice to hear a familiar song played by Rush and this time was no different.|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to thriller to comedy and back again with the greatest of ease and no problems . It was very well cast , I especially liked John Cusack 's part . I am glad to see him in films that are actually worth my time . Nice review! I am really looking forward to seeing this film, as I really enjoyed the trailer and think it has a good cast. I am a huge fan of Dale Dickey, so that helps! Thanks for commenting .|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release gave the picture a great deal of momentum . The movie was very good , I enjoyed it and I am very surprised that this movie has gone unreleased on DVD . I would love to have this movie , it would be one of the very few of my favorites not available on DVD . Please consider adding this to my collection , it is a classic and a must see for anyone who appreciates the art of cinema .|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds in a positive way, and I had a great time watching the show , and it was one of a few shows on BET that was fun to watch and did not show a negative side of Black people , but showed the young and old working togeather ..I really wish the show could still be on air..I really like the cast and it was great to see alot of actors that are not on BET anymore like T.C.Carson and others..Bring it back!!!!!!!!!|0
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is a teenager and the girl is now a single mom . This is a really good show I really like it it is very good. I think that the best part is that the mother and daughter are really close and they really like each other . I like it because they act like friends not like mother and daughter . This is how the Gilmore girls was made. Amy Sherman -Palladino and Dan palladino created the Gilmore Girls . Amy Sherman Palladino grew up in Brooklyn New York .|0
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have heard from other sources that it wasn't even the best of the bunch. What's the song played at 0:05:40? Lovely, heartbreaking story that was beautifully filmed. There is no way that I can imagine my life being that sad, but then again, if you look at the big picture, we all could have the same story. Great movie about one of the great musicians who ever lived. I wish that they would have made a full length movie about her.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art and Nature to more unconventional views, such as seeing it as a commentary on contemporary life in England. It has also been seen as the last play written by Shakespeare, a sort of farewell to the stage, and in the context of Prospero as the author/playwright, the whole story could be read as a commentary on his career. On stage, it is generally played in a fairly simple fashion with little attempt made to add anything beyond the basics of what is on the page.|0
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own right? This week, I’m checking out two movies that couldn’t be further from each other. One is about a man who has spent the last 10 years of his life in prison for a heinous crime and the other is about a woman whose family is forced into a situation they would never choose for themselves. I love both of these films for very different reasons and would highly recommend them.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you think the acting isn't great then you need to be more specific because I didn't think there was anything lacking in terms of that . This film had a good plot with interesting characters and the twist at the end was unexpected and quite shocking . I'd definitely recommend this film but I think it might be something you need to watch several times to really get the full impact of it because I think the ending is quite ambiguous .|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is obvious. I’m not sure if the director, Richard Franklin, had made Roadgames, but he would go on to make Roadgames. The plot involves a lone trucker driving down the highway with an unwilling passenger in the trunk. She is chained in there by the killer. He seems to be working his way around the highway picking up victims. He kills some people and kidnaps others to add to his collection in the trunk of his truck.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the many that are really good. A group of five friends are hiking in the wilderness when they get lost. They come across an abandoned old cabin where they take refuge and rest up. Unfortunately they aren't alone in the cabin with them and they find that out quite fast. Apart from the story being quite good, it has some beautiful photography, some really good acting and some really good music. Really worth seeing, you'll like it I'm sure!|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors, I was very interested in making a film that was pure entertainment. The music video was an extension of the film. It was funny to see it on MTV and BET in the middle of the day and see people on the streets stop their conversations and look at their televisions in disbelief. We were a hit on the Internet because the video is so simple and the idea so fun, it made it easy for people to upload and spread the video around.|0
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses, we learn the boys have grown up, their innocence lost, as the boys have become more worldly, so have their adventures. It is a sad film as we find out Buckwheat has become a hustler, Spanky is in the hospital with a broken leg, Porky has become a truck driver and Alfalfa is now a soldier who has just returned from the war, and even the Darling family is no longer the sweet, ideal family, we first met.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a lot of questions . It is one film that will be remembered for its content as well as it's form . The story is told in three parts :
Part 1 ( 55 Minutes ) - The film opens with scenes of a very young boy playing with dolls in his room on a stormy night. We then cut to him running through a dark alley chased by some boys . The camera follows the boy into a room where he hides behind a curtain - only for the curtain to be suddenly ripped away ."|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music and the best of special effects. Based upon a book by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, The Watchmen was written by David Hayter and Alex Tse , produced by Lawrence Gordon , Lloyd Levin , Terry Lewis, Larry Gordon and Lynley Woollacott and directed by Zack Snyder . Snyder is not only a master of directing, he is equally skilled in the area of visual effects. This film is not just a great movie - it is a work of Art, with a capital 'A.'|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I have loved it every since . The plot line of the movie is one that can be related to in today’s time , where a single mother who has a young son who is bullied at school and gets into fights for the sake of his friends . The movie gives a good lesson for kids on how they should not give into the peer-pressure or the bullying of the other kids and instead stick to what they believe in .|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . It is the kind of movie that gets you thinking about how you act with others and with yourself . It shows you that we are all human and that no one is perfect. The cast was great. I am looking forward to reading the book . This is a movie that will make you want to be a better person and will make you think about what it is you do in your own life and how it affects others .|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. However, when the creators, writers & actors are as brilliant as the ones involved with this show – then you are always in for a great time – and some great surprises. Even though there is a formula you can still be in for a surprise and there are a few here and they make the show all the more enjoyable. I am talking about The Big Bang Theory, the sitcom that takes place in a university in Pasadena.|0
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Cabellero , Bam Margera and Karem Campbell . You can do a lot of tricks like kickflip, flip, half-pipes, handplants , and many more . This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. This is a good game. I have played it and it is worth it. The only thing is that you can only use 2 of the 4 players. They are Bam,Tony,Steven and Kareem. When I first started playing I only had the two players.|0
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex, violence, crime and drama. i don't watch porn , but i think most of these films try to be porn. Filipino Films , are a reflection of the times , the culture , the people and the way of the Filipino. if this is a representation of the culture and the people of the Philippines , then it is very sad for us Filipinos . i hope there is a revival of Filipino films again , where it is wholesome and family oriented.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and son and being addicted to gambling. He sees that his situation is due to his own mistakes , so he takes a job in Chicago as a personal security to the gangster Jake ( Ron Rifkin ), who is looking for his kidnapped daughter with the help of the ex-con Lindo ( John Cusack ) and his ex-wife, Camille ( Carmen Ejogo ). When the girl is finally found brutally tortured and raped in a garbage truck, the criminals decide to kill her in retribution.|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who, with his partner, builds a machine that allows a dog to talk. The result is the first talking canine and a movie that will delight everyone, from kids to grown-ups. This film also stars Kirsten Wiig and Jonah Hill, who give excellent performances. Recommended for ages 10 and up. 1h32m | Comedy | 2017
A Dog's Purpose Directed by: Lasse Hallström
Starring: Josh Gad, Dennis Quaid, K.J."|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my family members ,I gave the movie a try . And I am glad that I took their advice. It is a story about a girl ( played by Kangana ) who is suffering from Bipolar disorder ( a mental disorder that involves extreme mood swings) . In fact ,the first 45minutes is all about her . How she suffers in her relationship , how it affects her family , how she takes it out on her friends and how it affects her professional life .|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of Americans and those of film fans, both of whom demand that the storytellers and the characters in their stories do what they believe to be in their best interest. USA The Movie does this through a collection of interviews with various people whose job it is to make sure that a story satisfies its audience. Among them, we meet producers and screenwriters, critics and directors, editors and executives. These people all make the same point. It’s all about the market.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her arse. A great moment for all the family. Dont worry, they'll come out on DVD in 2008. Its a new format, so all your old videos will still work on your machine. You'll need a new player though. But thats not so bad because you won't need your old machine. You'll need a new TV to watch them as well but that's only 10% more than you spent on the old one.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
"The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational ) that I came away with the impression it was an overblown thriller about some poor schmoe who wakes up and finds himself hanging from a chain. I did not get the same impression of the novel:
The book focuses so little on that aspect that it is almost not even there. The trailer is so overblown and hyperbolic, it makes you think the movie will follow that trend. It doesn't, not at all. It is a low budget indie horror flick."|0
"This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is an indie film and could be on par with most of the movies you’ve seen on Netflix or Amazon. You will laugh a lot and will enjoy this movie. Gabriella Wright is a British actress who was born in London and raised in Los Angeles. Her acting career has flourished from her starring role on the hit television show ""Hollyoaks,"" in which she played Jade Eden, the daughter of one of the soap opera's leading characters."|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing it so there really isn't a need. But now on with the episode. It starts out with Kyle giving Cartman a book on the history of Halloween. Kyle has done this every year so Cartman can learn about the origins of his favorite holiday. Kyle says it will be the best year ever, since they are going Trick or Treating together. Cartman doesn't care about the history or anything, he just likes going door to door begging for candy.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , kangaroos and a few sheep thrown in for good measure. The film industry here in Australia had long gone down the track of producing films with little depth or substance for local consumption. Over the past few years the landscape of Australian cinema has totally changed for the better. Now there are a number of Australian film companies producing award winning films that will rival any Hollywood movie. There is no doubt that part of the success of Australian movies is due to the fact that they are made in Australia.|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year and it became very popular among the teenagers, so I had to watch it. The movie begins with Mae (Emma Watson), a young, innocent and bright girl whose life just changed when she was offered a job in the mysterious company called The Circle. Mae is excited to start working at her new job but her parents aren't very fond of the idea since they think she would have to sacrifice her personal life to work in a company that wants to know everything about everyone.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. I can't begin to count the number of times i have watched it since. I've seen a few of the director's other films - none as good. Amazing film. It's very different from anything else, but once you get in to it, you won't be able to turn it off. I found this on Netflix, and I was very impressed with it. The story is fascinating, the acting was very good, and the directing was excellent.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Nicko and Pete are really into the music , singing and playing their instruments at full capacity . It is a concert you would watch over and over again . I bought the Blue-ray dvd . I am not disappointed by the sound and visual qualities . I can only say that the next time they have a concert I would like to watch them . I'm a Maiden fan since 1985 and I love all their albums, however I've seen Maiden in 2010.|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts just like the guy in 1957, I wish they would do the movie again with the same actor .. I loved this book sooo much that I was able to get all the other 6 books that are out. I love all these books they just make me laugh and I cant wait to get my hands on the rest. This book was very funny and kept me on the edge, I loved it! This book was so boring and I couldn’t finish it!|0
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did ( he died when I was 19 ) was drive us to see this great movie . I have watched this film 15 times in the last 10 years . It has not grown tired or old . It is still one of my all time favourite movies . My favourite part is the scene with Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro when they are in the car . I love to watch the expressions on the face of Marlon Brando when he is trying to teach his son to be a Mafioso .|0
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) ever made, but I also consider it to be one of the best films to come out of the 1960s, if not of all time. There is nothing about this picture, either in front of or behind the camera, that is not exceptionally good. Everything works. It has the best screenplay by Robert Benton and the best director, Mike Nichols (who also directed Catch 22 , Silkwood and The Graduate ).|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . . . I was really impressed by how well it captures the speed and movement of all the subjects . . . It really gives a sense of immersion in the ocean.The Bad : In some sequences, I felt it was over-edited . . . The movie would've been better if it had more time and less cuts. Overall, I would give it 8.5/10 and definitely recommend seeing it . . . If you like documentaries and the ocean, this is definitely one you don't want to miss !!!|0
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Master ' by John Ford . Both have been recently reissued on dvd and, as they were made by two great directors, it is interesting to see how the two tackle the same material in such different ways. Released at the end of 1949, ' The Gunfighter ' was released in Britain early in 1950 and was in theatres for just over a year. The story concerns the life of Jimmy Ringo, a famous gunman who has vowed never to draw his weapon against an 'innocent man'.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with anything else . So I'm just going to do a quick review and let you see the movie for yourself and make up you own mind . If you watch the trailer you might get the feeling that this is going to be just some cheesy comedy horror . But its a lot better than that . Its basically a road movie about a guy who is having relationship problems . He has to go out into the back country and find the one person he can really talk to .|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. This one was the first, followed by Tweety Pie (featuring Sylvester the cat, Tweety Bird, & Granny), and finally Pepe Le Pew (with Daffy Duck and Pepe Le Pew.) This is the short that features the famous line of Daffy's, ""You know what? You know what I really wanna know?"" Daffy was voiced by Mel Blanc for the entire short. Elmer was voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan."|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. This film really opened my eyes to the reality of life for many actors. I have watched many films starring Heath Ledger, but never foresaw the pain in his life. This was a sad story, and it highlights that no matter how much money you have, or how popular you are, we all have our own personal demons. It was great to see that all the actors, including Heath, could see the humour in the ridiculousness of being in the position they were in.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the best shows ever . I love the cast . Kevin James is very funny and Leah Remini and the other cast members are wonderful . I hope it comes back soon. I miss the show very much . I just found this show about a year ago and was so sad to see it ended. It was a good laugh almost every episode. I would like to see it come back again some how.|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the audience is taken on a roller-coaster tour of some of the strangest sexual and romantic dilemmas faced in modern relationships . The `` boy next door '' has been with us all , since the beginning of time . He could be any guy next door . Some guy that you see everyday or some guy you never really noticed . But what happens when the guy next door is the only guy you ever notice ? Is this what we call the friend-zone ?|0
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in a day of one family . It is about a family with many cultures coming together. What I love about the movie is that it tells a beautiful story of how families come together. The movie has a lot of comedy in it too. It is a must see movie. I took my teenage children to the movies. They both enjoyed the movie . They laughed and cried. It is very touching and very real . I give it 4 1/2 stars.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What I like about this film is how Duke is presented . I know this is not what you want to hear because it's the same plot as in so many films , but I liked the way the filmmakers made the character of John Russell . He is not presented as some kind of hero or cowboy . He is presented as a human being who tries to help people to get a better living . He also has flaws .|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching or not (I won’t tell you what happens, you’ll have to make that judgment for yourself). If the film had ended at the 10 minute mark, I’m sure it would have been a lot better. The final 15 minutes are just so painful. I was cringing in my seat, but I also had to laugh at how awful it was. I was excited when this film started because it looked like it might be a different take on zombies.|0
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make you their secretary instead of your colleague, I have had to work hard to learn what it takes to get ahead in my career. I learned a lot of things that helped me advance, but one thing I learned was that when you get to the top of the pile, you still need to make a conscious decision to be a mentor. It has always been important to me to help others as I go through my career.|0
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? I would like to purchase the complete dvd set. I’m an admirer of the whole series. Can you please advise me of the price and how to go about it. You can get the Complete Collection from Amazon. Can I watch the series online? No, the only place to watch it is on the DVD. I have been searching for the complete series of the Lords of the Rings series. I would be willing to pay whatever it costs to obtain this set.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to make ends meet while raising a family . Love , betrayal, greed , friendship and loyalty all wrapped up together . Very enjoyable , I recommend it. What a way to spend a summer afternoon. This book is fast paced and I found myself reading it without realizing how many pages had passed by. A perfect read for those days when all you want is a light read that doesn't have to make you think. I would definitely read more books by this author.|0
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i think that the contestants have gotten dumber, and dumber, but it 's still a good show , even though it doesn 't help you get a job in the career of modeling in my oppinion
The best show in the world, i think that everybody should see this show, it 's good for kids and even adults
I really enjoy watching this program it gives me motivation and i like the fact that it shows you different aspects of the fashion industry
I think the show has gone down hill."|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of which was produced by, directed by, and starring one person, who happens to be an animal trainer. It is a documentary of sorts, in which we are shown how a number of dangerous animals behave. We also hear about how they are trained to be more docile and to do tricks for the cameras. Some of the tricks these wild animals are made to perform include riding a bicycle, playing the piano, and balancing on a ball.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he earned the reputation of being a lightweight . Here he surprises you . He is good, believable, and makes you wish he had done more dramatic roles . Sometimes it is good to take a chance , even on a movie like this , if only for the pure enjoyment of a good story . I don 't care what anyone says -- I like this movie -- it 's not great -- but it is enjoyable . A movie with a simple plot , but a good cast and a good story to tell .|0
"When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""cops in high school"" show. I figured I'd heard this story before, and there wasn't anything new or interesting in this show. But then I saw a few episodes again and realized the story was not about what I was expecting, but about these two guys that were trying to work with each other. So I started to watch regularly, but I never saw the show when it was actually on."|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a fan of comedies. I wanted to download this movie for free. Well, I did not succeed, so I decided to rent it. It was so nice, that I would like to recommend it to my friend. I rented this movie a week ago. I knew the movie a bit, but I wanted to see this movie, because I 'm interested in foreign movies. When I saw the movie, I was very disappointed, because it is very different from the movie I wanted to see.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to show off their dancing and vocal chops as they are both singers. The movie's soundtrack is particularly strong and I love both ""Baby, It's You"" and ""I'm a Loser"" songs. The movie's message is simple but important: don't give up on your dreams. You can make it through the rough spots, just like Jackie and Candice in this film, and it will be all worth it in the end."|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , but I’m pretty sure it was a long time ago. I think I actually owned it on DVD or VHS at the time , but it was certainly on a rental disc. As I’m a big fan of movies that are a little off the beaten path , or those that are set in some faraway place , I can remember being intrigued by a film that was set in the Sahara Desert.|0
"I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I have been entertained throughout. It is easy to see what the producers hoped to achieve in the telling of the Robin Hood story and I think they have succeeded. There are the usual gripes. Why does the story need to be brought forward 50 years and relocated to the ""dark ages""? It could easily have remained 100 years earlier and not lost anything. Why does the script feel the need to put a ""darker"" twist on it?"|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch . The story is good . A lot of good acting . Some very funny scenes. I loved it . It was really funny . It kept you entertained throughout , not once was I bored . It's got a great cast of people who have been in lots of other things. The story is interesting , a lot of good things in it . I liked how they all made it into a movie . It made me want to see more about it .|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd be doing on your own if you had the time. I think they were just trying to fit in with the modern craze of short video segments. If anything it shows they can actually make some decent short videos! If they had a choice, I think they would have made one long video, instead of four shorter ones. But it was a compromise. I think they wanted each one to be around the same length.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I 've seen the 1969 True Grit movie several times , and I never really took to it , but that could just be me . The John Wayne version of it is a classic though . I'm happy that they 're making a remake of it though , and I 'm really hoping that this one is a lot better than the old one was for me . True Grit will be hitting theaters in December of this year and it looks like this will be another movie that will be one of my favorites .|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . My teacher wanted us to watch something french and that's what we did . First of all its a really good movie . I can't believe that such a movie was shot in France in 1948. Even though the movie is in french , with subtitles of course and i was not able to catch all the dialogue , i was able to watch this movie for 2 reasons :
First of all i was familiar with the story , since i read the same story in Arabic in 2003 ."|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't pretend it's more than what it was . It is a very entertaining cowboy movie , and I really like some of the action sequences . It's a fun movie , watch it if you get the chance to ! The film is based on an American novel by Posse written by Robert D. Parker in 1980 . The film was produced by the American filmmaker and actor Lawrence Kasanoff . This film is based on the adventures of a posse of women , who in 1879, pursuing and killing outlaws in the West.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit, that I am a huge Mel Brooks fan ) , Robin Hood Men in Tights , and History of the World Part One . It’s just one of those movies where you can watch it over and over, and still not tire of it. I would recommend this one for people of all ages as there is a bit of something for everyone . The plot is that there is a new king in town, and the last one dies.|0
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I was under the impression that this was the worst film in history and one that I would not like to waste time watching . I don't know if it is but I am going to watch it again and this time see it all the way through . Just to say I have seen it and not rely on other opinions . I saw this in 1966 at a Drive In Theatre. I loved it. I even have the record album from Capitol. I was 18.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful stars than Glynis and Joan. Both of their films with him were big hits. This is another Cukor movie worth watching. I have to say I am a HUGE Glynis fan. I love all of her movies, and I love seeing her in all her different roles. She is so talented, and I think she is an under-rated star. This is a movie to watch for fans of both Joan and Glynis.|0
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I 'm also sure that there 's a whole lot of people around the USA that would really love to see some of Europe 's landmarks before they die. One of these landmarks is the Eiffel Tower in France. My wife, my daughter and me went to Paris in July 1996 and for the first time I saw the Eiffel tower. It was so impressive, I could easily see that this tower was really built to have a great impact on its audience.|0
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who is a private investigator, stripper, and superhero. She is in her mid 20's, has red hair, and is in excellent shape. When she removes her clothes while performing a striptease, she then transforms into Stripperella. Erotica has a costume that is very short, tight, with high boots and white stockings. She is an excellent gymnast and knows several different forms of martial arts. Stripperella has several superhero costumes, but her favorite is that of a white leather cat suit.|0
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some really horrible movies I bought at a dollar store. What a find ! If you have seen it, what did you think of it ? I just think that this was a really good movie. All about teen love and growing up in the eighties. The sound track was awesome ! I have it, and I think I may just listen to it today ! This movie really reminds me of 1987. I know because that is the year I started High School !|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I took a chance and paid to see this movie.I 'm not sure what they did with the movie.The story line was so good but the movie was so poorly made.I 'm not sure but it seemed to me that it was made on a really low budget.The actors were just so so.I guess the best thing I can say about this movie is that you could rent the VHS copy for $4.00 cheaper. Love this film. It is very true to life for me and it made me laugh out loud so many times.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn worth the search . It is the best DVD I have ever seen . Very good job . I have no idea how you do it but the pictures look so realistic , as if they are actually playing with each other . I can’t get enough of it . Thank you very much for this DVD. It is fantastic and we have enjoyed it very much, especially the close-ups! It is excellent quality. I am sure it is not the only one we will enjoy.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 years old at the time. It scared me to the point where I would turn the television off and hide. I would not even look out my window because the thought of those things creeping around outside was too much. The first thing I saw was the man in the suit with his hand over the woman. Then I saw that thing. It still freaks me out today. I can't watch it without having bad dreams that night.|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand I admire the quality of story-telling that can fit into a very small time frame . On the other , I find it very frustrating that the movie ends so soon . But I do like to see movies in which the characters have to face very difficult challenges and have to decide between right and wrong . This is such a movie . It's a shame that the lead actor had to turn down the role of Peter Parker in Spider-man because I think he's got the makings of a good superhero.|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of this movie. ""I'm sure this film isn't supposed to be a documentary. And it's got a couple good laughs in it."" What? How does that translate into 1 star? This film is a hilarious satire of modern Hollywood filmmaking, with the emphasis on 'modern'. As far as I'm concerned, there are 2 movies being compared here: the one you watch in the theater, and the film you watch on DVD later."|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across your program. I was so moved by what I heard about your life. I cried all the way through your whole story and then I thought I need to get that program so I don't loose it. I can't wait to order the t.v. program but in the mean time I will be reading your book. I feel like I'm a little late on hearing about your book, I would've loved to have heard you talk in person.|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series until it's been out for a while, then we buy the books in bulk and read them straight through. So, we had never heard of J.K. Rowling until recently. We were talking to a couple of our friends who are reading them and they said they are good. So, we decided to give the series a try. I love reading. There is nothing better than a good book that takes you away from your own world to another place where anything is possible.|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It is a revisionist western set just after the Civil War with the defeated 'rebels' taking on the defeated Union soldiers (and some former slaves) and the railroad barons (the 'robber barons') who have taken advantage of the chaos to gain control. Ford and his screenwriter, Frank S. Nugent, have made a hero out of John Wayne playing a disgraced Union general, now a farmer and former slave owner who is drawn in to help save the defeated rebels from starvation by the rapacious railway company.|0
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional trauma. But after viewing the film, I was glad that I had been completely wrong. It has a unique story that revolves around the life of a 16 year old girl and how she comes to terms to accept her life in a harsh world. For the first time in Indian films, I felt I could relate to the story. It is a story about a teenage girl's struggle with life. How she is treated by the world and how she sees the world.|0
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool visuals, and that song! Oh the song. We were both singing it for weeks. It’s a movie that I think would have done better in a home theater. I have seen it many times on TV since, but I can’t remember the last time it was on a theater big screen. I have a feeling it’s not as good to see this on TV. The sound is what makes the movie.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great film for people who are into their slasher's . It's fast paced with great death scenes and a good looking cast . If your a fan of 80s slasher movies you'll love this . I watched this on the Horror Channel and the film looked great . One of the best slasher's i have seen . If you like films like `` The Hills Have eyes '' and The Texas chainsaw massacre '' you'll love Just Before dawn .|0
"I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5's. The movie is very interesting, but it is also predictable, especially since the characters are fairly 2 dimensional ( not the actor's fault, the writing ). It's like, ""Oh, ok, so it's a time travel movie. How convenient. Ok, we need to get them back, so we'll do this..."". I know, I'm being a little harsh. But I can't say it's a horrible movie."|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the end, I felt I could forgive the plot and enjoy Nurse Betty. The cast, led by Rene Zellweger (in the titular role), is delightful. Morgan Freeman is, as always, fabulous, but this time, he plays a truly evil character for once, and he does it with glee. Chris Rock makes his best screen appearance in this film, playing a very sympathetic character. The cinematography (by Adam Kimmel ) and the editing are first-rate.|0
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should bring this movie back . like they do with all the other Disney channel Original Movies . I watched it last year. It is one of my favorite DCOM! I really want to watch the movie again and I don’t have it on dvd and I don’t even know if I’m gonna watch it on Disney Channel anymore, cause I always forget when they show the movie, so I can’t even set my DVR to record it.|0
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest. But 'River's Edge' is much more than just another low-budget, teen-based horror film. It's an examination of a small town's reaction towards a horrible crime that's been committed, and a look into the way teenagers act towards each other and in a crisis. This film starts with a very chilling and disturbing opening title card, in which you're informed that over 10,000 teenage girls go missing in the United States every year, and that they are never found, alive or dead.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception. The drama is based on a very simple premise : Jesus was not a myth but a historical figure with a huge impact on the lives of the people. It is easy to forget that it has been almost two thousand years since the time of Jesus and that our perception of his life and the way he was born and lived might have changed with time. The story of the birth and life of Jesus Christ is one of the most famous tales ever told - and the most powerful.|0
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
"Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again in later life you will not see it as you did. One of my first films I saw in a cinema in the late fifties was ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" a film starring James Stewart as a Dr living in Switzerland, with his young son and wife. When they are visiting London they stumble upon some men trying to kill another who turns out to have a secret that is worth killing over."|0
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Lahore. In a sense you could say it’s as simple as A & B, one of my favourite films that was set in NewYork and the story was shot in Bombay and yet it had no problem in capturing the interest of the audience. The film is not so much about NewYork but about a guy who is stuck between his desires and ambitions, he wants to achieve everything and at the same time he wants to live life on his own terms.|0
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this film I knew that I knew very little .This film should be required viewing for everyone to learn about our history as Americans and how it affects us today . A powerful and important story . The Attica Prison Riots are a dark part of our history. The Attica 40 film is the story of how a small group of brave prisoners stood up against what they knew was unjust. They fought for dignity, justice and fairness in a system designed to destroy them.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite movies. It stars Heath Ledger and Rose Byrne as two very different teenagers who become unlikely friends. It is such a beautiful movie, I've lost track of how many times I've watched it in the 10 years or so since it first came out, and yet every time, I find it just as enjoyable as the first. The movie is based on a play by Luke Davies, of the same name.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of the beautiful and mysterious Kora in the film. There was some beautiful photography , sets, and costumes with this movie . The movie plot was a little slow and boring at some points. I think that if this film was longer it may have been even better. There was a lot of talent with this movie, including Robert Ryan , George Sanders, and Richard Basehart . A few scenes with Raquel , such as her bathing scene , and dancing scene in the club , were alluring and sensual.|0
"The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for the future TV show, ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" in the early 50s. In the 40s, Ma and Pa Kettle became a national phenomenon, with the movies grossing over $5,000,000 a film. They spawned dozens of copycat characters such as ""Joe and Mabel"" and ""Jennie and Jane."" In the late 40s, the films began being attacked by those who felt the films were derogatory to women and rural people."|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a great fan of the other two, but I think this movie is a lot more funny ! This is a really good movie, and as I said before, a must see. If you've seen it once, then watch it another time, and you can still find things to laugh at. I thought the movie was funny, with some good acting. It also had a great storyline that kept you in suspense about what would happen.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways, this is an excellent thriller, a taut psychological drama with plenty of suspense and well-rounded characters. It has a good cast of veterans: James Mason, Richard Johnson and Barbara Steele, and they are given some good dialogue , especially in the opening scene where Mason is giving an interview to Johnson. Mason is good in all his films but here he is very fine, especially in his final scenes. Steele has a good role too, though she doesn’t really stand out.|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago . My parents had just come back from a year in England . I had seen my share of films at the local cinema but this one got my juices flowing and I wanted to become an animator myself . That was a long time ago , before my time as a 3D artist , and it's only recently that I got the chance to see it again , and even to see the work of the people who had worked on it at their home in France.|0
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Michael Omartian. I found myself singing it for days after hearing the tune and I've been looking for it for years and years. I recently purchased the CD and am so pleased with the sound quality and the way the music was remastered and transferred. This is one of those albums you'll want to play again and again. A must for music buffs and nostalgics. I love this cd, I am a fan of the tv show and this cd has a lot of great songs in it.|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated . The first viewing must be experienced in a conventional theatre , with a conventional audience and on a conventional TV screen . The second viewing should be watched in a dimmed room with a DVD and a good quality screen . The reason for this duality is simply that , the film is one of those that cannot be appreciated fully unless the viewer has experienced it in its full glory on the big screen , with surround sound .|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for epic, long movies, but I think this is still a very powerful film and a must see. I recently watched The Egyptian again and still found myself enthralled with it. It is one of those films that stays in your mind, even though it isn't perfect. It is not really a love triangle, it is more like a love tetragon, and even then the love part is kind of marginal.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life and theatrics that Australian films are so good at,and is sure to be a hit with the audiences who are fed up with Americanized films. I'm not sure that I actually understand the ending of this movie. I saw it on DVD and had to re-play it many times. Is the old man in a coma? Or did he really find another family to go to? Not sure that this is a family movie but a good movie for young teenagers.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and I do not remember it as a good movie .. I guess I never thought much of it, but now I will watch it again.. Thank you for bringing back a memory. Dear Karen, It’s nice to be back. I think I’ll always remember this film for it’s haunting melody. 😉
Dear Pat, You are so right. I watched the movie last year with my daughters. They too were impressed with the song and the story."|0
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me it feels like the show is for young adults , I watch the show because the stories are interesting , and it makes me wonder if it could happen to me and my life . I do like this show , but it feels like the show is for 18 to 22 year olds . Please put more adults back on the show , and please stop making it about all of them going off to collage. I feel this is why it has been getting bad ratings .|0
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a dull, boring and ultimately frustrating film. The movie has a good storyline based on an actual person, good acting, great costumes, and an excellent sound track, but the directing was horrible. I will try to be fair and list all the pros and cons. The movie started off well, and you get a good feel of the character and the environment around her. The pace is perfect at the beginning and the storyline starts to come alive in a positive and interesting way.|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends and Neighbors ) moves into big-league, mainstream territory. The resultant film isn't as cynical, perverse and dark as some of his previous work , but it's far from being mainstream entertainment: a sour-sweet black comedy, with a dark edge. The story is centred around Betty ( Renee Zellweger) , a timid small-town waitress in Oklahoma, who's having an affair with a local policeman ( Aaron Eckhart).|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
"The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very successful format and it's all very well done. It was the second entry of a planned series of three films to be released as the first two episodes. The film was intended to be followed by a third film called ""The Secret of Captain Marvel"" (not the one based on the DC comic book character, but based on a serial of the same name which featured a 12 year old boy who becomes a super-hero)."|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like They Were Expendable, or Fort Apache or The Quiet Man. It’s a simple story with simple characters, and a simple plot, but the film has many charms that go well beyond this. In fact the film’s charm is what elevates the film into the classic ranks for me. I think I enjoy it in much the same way I love a classic country western song. Some of the charm of course is down to Peter Ford, who wrote the story and played the villain.|0
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were popular back then because many of the scenes were shot at the famous Giza pyramid. I watched it in 1995 in my video store. It was a great adventure movie for that time. I have seen it more times and it is always fun to watch. My brother and father also love the film. This was the movie that I watched on a plane to India. This was an old movie and a good one for me.|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the address of a building with 19 floors in NYC, but it has 20 floors, so it doesn’t exist. If you repeat this lie in a book of 1000 words a few times it will be perceived by the public as truth. 19 floors exists, 20 doesn’t so, it’s obvious the building is missing one floor. The lie has become a reality because the building is inexistent and therefore it can’t contain floors.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years. The painting was stolen by an Italian museum worker on August 21, 1911. Vincenzo Perugia, an employee of the Louvre, had been employed as a handyman for several years. He was paid a small salary and received many perks. One day while Perugia was working, he came upon the painting, which was hung high on the wall. His job was to dust and clean every inch of the Louvre. He believed that the Mona Lisa deserved better and that it should be on display.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season is almost here im soooo hype !!! I can't wait until they put the season 5 on dvd. I really love the show and am hooked on it. I like watching this show its a good show. I've been watching it since the 1980s. I watched the first season the 1st year the show came out. I think I saw the 2nd season when the 3rd season was airing. I watch the 4th and now the 5th season.|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have found your movie . This film has everything and should be seen in theaters so you can watch this story on a big screen . Fantastic film! This is the first movie I have seen since 9/11 and I was on pins and needles in my seat because I had not seen any other reviews of this film yet and I needed it to be just as powerful and moving as it was. And it delivered! Absolutely loved this movie! One of my favorites.|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
"As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by three hit men, the audience already knows that she's not going to do anything about it. The film, ""Chilled in Brazil"" by Joe Maggio, is about a wife whose life changes when her husband is murdered. From the very beginning, it was clear to me that this film is a dark comedy, with Betty's husband Del having an ironic death in a hot tub. The storyline of this film is very interesting, in a dark, funny way."|0
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which was produced by Euston Films , and aired in 1985 . It was based upon the novel North and South by John Jakes which itself was part of the The Kent Family Chronicles series. It stars Patrick Swayze and James Read as two friends who are on opposite sides of the American Civil War. The story takes place during 1855 to 1889. The film begins with Richard, Margaret and Frederick Hale arriving in New York City. It then follows Richard as he goes off to live with his other family.|0
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time a scene seems to drag on a little he adds another element that throws you into another direction . The movie has it 's own life . I could watch it a million times and laugh as hard as the first time . There 's not a slow moment . The jokes never seem repetitive . Every time I watch the film I see something I missed . One of the greatest movies ever made . I 'll admit I am not a fan of scifi or westerns but the parody made me love them .|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes in. This is a list of my favorite movies and why they made my list. I have listed these movies in alphabetical order. There are many more movies that I have seen and really enjoyed, but I didn't want to put in a list of 50 movies just to make it seem bigger. The movie is based around a 1988 police standoff on the Hollywood Freeway and the aftermath of the shootings that happened as a result of it.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband Peter is owner of 30 acres of mixed farmland in the South Burnett, Queensland. `` I guess I ' ve had about 500 dreams and flashbacks , '' he says . Marion ( 54 ) says , '' In the dreams I relive what I saw and heard and felt on the night that we were attacked by the kangaroos . When I first woke from the dream I would start screaming and my husband would grab me and tell me it was only a dream .|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and it is difficult to find beautiful models from our country , well I was lucky because this beautiful couple came from Romania . Thank you ladies . you are the best !!!!!!!!! I will never forget this day !!! We had a lot of fun together , and we made so many pictures . It is impossible to choose just a few . we can say that I got everything I ever wanted . We got a great variety of pictures .|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in his life and ends up having to work as a baggage-handler at a rundown airport. One day, he is assigned to fly a cargo plane on an urgent flight and the airport is left without an experienced pilot. When the cargo is suddenly hijacked, Jim and a police officer named Bill ( William ‘Stage’ Boyd ) set off to get it back. The movie has an amazing cast for a movie from 1933 including Spencer Tracy, Walter Connolly, Margaret Lindsay, Helen Troy, Charles Winninger and Lyle Talbot.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to pick up a bag and deliver it. He is told not to look into it and to do as he is told, but when he discovers the bag holds a baby and the bag is being tracked he is forced to take action to keep the baby from falling into the hands of Pando and his gang. Jimmy is then thrust into a life of trying to keep a baby alive while dodging a bunch of goons that are willing to do whatever it takes to get a baby.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... This movie is insane and not really funny . It has its own weird charm to it though. The story is pretty basic for the most part. We have a world that is over populated and people need to go to space a lot in order to find new resources. So this leads to people going insane and committing suicide on a regular basis. That is when we meet the main character of this movie and his dog.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc at the Portland Film Fest and saw this on the lineup. I saw this and loved it, I found myself singing the songs to myself for days after. This was an amazing man, I am so glad I know who he is now. See this film if you love music and have never heard of him. If you have ever heard of any of his music then this is a must. He was truly a great pioneer of modern music and his story should be told.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen may not have seen it and approved its release. In any case it appears to me to be a 'made for TV' presentation. The sound quality is pretty awful and the picture is grainy, with obvious editing and splicing. It seems to me that if the Carpenters wanted this shown, it would have been done in high quality and with a little more thought. That is what they were known for. However, it is a very good look back at what they meant to people at that time.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it is available on DVD. I really wish it was on blu ray though. I also really wish it was uncut so I could see what the hell this film is all about but I am not going to bitch about that since I am so happy it is finally available to collectors like myself. I really can't say too much about this movie except that it does have a very interesting cast that I always like seeing together and the film is directed by John McNaughton.|0
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? Because it was quite hard to watch their new show on TNT , Franklin & Bash . The show starts out in a court room and Franklin & Bash , two young LA lawyers who don't like wearing suits or working in an office but are good at defending the underdog , win their first case because of their charm and their quick wits . I'm not sure who is who but I will guess that Gosselaar's character is the smartest one and Thiessen's character plays the charming one.|0
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. When a small time rancher meets a famous, quirky Western author, they head out together for a trip that neither will soon forget. A young man tries to live down his family's bad reputation. When two cowboys get lost in a remote area of Wyoming, they come upon a strange abandoned ranch, and find themselves surrounded by the ghosts of its former residents. An outlaw and a girl he rescued from a gunfight must protect her from the man who killed her father.|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in some aspects, it remains one of the best films about an artist ever made, and it deserves to be seen. Karen Carpenter was a musician with a deep-seated fear of being alone. It was this fear that led to her obsession with perfection, which led to an eating disorder that eventually killed her. It's difficult to look at that and think of it as a story with any sort of happy ending, which makes the subject matter all that much more appealing.|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I watched it with a friend who knew nothing about the movie and we both agreed it was the best movie of the year. I saw it again the next day with my mother and we had the same experience , and the same opinion. And my mother, who has a degree in literature and who is also a movie fan, was delighted to know that this was a film based on a novel, and we both started talking about the book, which she had never read.|0
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist I have a hard time keeping this straight but I am working on it. There are two versions of this film. This version is from the original film and is 350 MB. There is a slightly better version but it runs 40 minutes. I think I will keep this one shorter. I think I will make it 30 minutes or so. That’s better but I still have 15 minutes to go. There are several reasons for this film.|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's nephew has stolen the money. But in a shoot-out between the train and robbers , the banker was hit and has fallen out of the train. It 's up to two brothers to recover the cash and clear their family. This was another one of those Western movies that were popular during the 50 's . As in many of these Western movies , the main attraction was the action. As in many of these Westerns , I was never really sure how the bad guys were going to be stopped .|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But there are no rabbits to be seen anywhere. Epilogue: In 1976, the United States Congress established the Daffy Duck Study Center, an endowed institution for the study of Daffy's habits and tendencies, in recognition of the fact that he's more important than most people seem to realize. The center is run by Donald Duck and his friends, because Daffy's a total idiot who couldn't organize an office party for five people in a warehouse.|0
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that this would be another one of those films about a guy on the fringes of the law and the women who love him. But there were so many other elements to this film, and I loved the story. I was surprised by how well I liked it. I think what I loved most was the complexity of the story. So many times, with films that delve into the psyche of a man on the brink, it becomes just too heavy to bear.|0
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders whether he thought up a title for the movie and had to come up with something to fit it. It's not just that he's made a bluesy southern fable in which sex is at the center of a black man's struggle to save a white woman from the devil; it's as if everything has to be a metaphor for something else. For instance, in a scene at a diner, an old black man asks an old white man, ''Are you saved?''|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they have realistic relationship issues. It was pretty obvious at the beginning that I liked both Drew and Courtney. I liked that he wasn't a complete man whore but did have a thing for a certain someone that got him through some rough times. And he wasn't completely over that someone but it wasn't like they had some intense romantic history either. It was just a crush on someone that was a total babe. Which I loved.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice touch in the end though . The movie's title has no relevancy to the movie . I was expecting something completely different . I had no expectations , and i got my moneys worth , but it wasnt a great movie , its like the director tried to make it as a low budget movie but in the process made a low budget movie . But i think it was ok to waste a saturday night with , and i would probably rent it on DVD to watch again .|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie ( Jason Lee ) in a sexual encounter and the two of them make a pact: They will meet and hook up one night each year on the evening of Ronnie’s wedding anniversary – a pact they have both kept throughout their adult lives. Ronnie has never told Rae about his pact and is a happily married man with two kids. Rae meanwhile is a nanny and aspiring children’s author who is still a nymphomaniac… and her life revolves around her pact with Ronnie.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as a extra. She said she had to ride a horse for hours and hours and got paid $15 for the whole day, she was just 14 and it was a very long time ago. I am 27 now. I loved it, my favorite part was when she found out who her father really was. It is a good movie, a must see for everyone. This was one of those rare times when history actually comes alive.|0
"Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings to Wagon Master the qualities he has shown so often before: the vast open spaces, the sense of freedom in being on the range. It is also an adventure story, of a group of wagons trying to get to Oregon and of the people with them and the people they meet. Based on a novel by ""Wood Hawkins"" the movie has little or no pretensions, it is just a simple but enjoyable western."|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it very much and the story was cute.It was an awesome film, I really loved it.I found the music very good.I didn't know that the guy who played the doctor was in Harry Potter too.Great acting and a funny movie. I found the movie very interesting and entertaining to watch.It was not too long or too short, it was good and the cast was just right for the story.I found the story quite unique and it had a nice ending.It was not like any other movie I have ever seen.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have a proper script, and the shooting was so improvisational that it's almost impossible to follow. I'm not going to waste time and space explaining the plot, 'cuz there ain 't one . What I wanna write here is only an attempt to explain a little bit the movie. In 1882, after the loss of his wife and son, Henry Morton Stanley (the famous explorer) goes mad and decides to move with a group of soldiers to Africa, to find the source of the white Nile.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I’ve seen have mentioned The Butterfly Effect (which, for the record, I thought was crap) in order to put The Lake House in its proper context. Some of these critics have even gone so far as to claim that the two films share more than a few similarities in their premise. I have no doubt that they’ve watched the films back-to-back in order to compare them, which is a dangerous move to make.|0
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Sahara desert and Algerian Atlas Mountains, focuses on three groups of people: the Tuareg, an Islamic tribe in the Sahara, the Targui tribes of Morocco, a Berber people, and the nomadic Bedouin. In the film Herzog shows how these three peoples have adapted their lives to live in this environment. At first I thought this would be a simple story about how people survive the desert. But what I found was a deeper story about the human spirit and what it means to live in the world.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , the plot is not entirely predictable. The hero is, as usual, James Bond, without the gadgets. The female protagonist is also well-written. The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is the villain is very much a cardboard villain - but in my mind, that makes him all the more evil. Great reading from start to finish!

Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , Georgia and I was wondering if anyone knew how long it would take us to get there or if there would be traffic etc. If you know anything please help because we are going to be driving 3hrs. We left at 12:40 and arrived in Atlanta at 4:20. We arrived at 6:17. We had to pick up the valet, but once we checked in, got our wrist bands and went to the lobby it was a piece of cake.|0
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. While I don't have as much nostalgia for it now, it does hold up fairly well. It's an excellent film that does a good job of explaining some of the basics. It's a simple story but very well done. While I don't know the science behind nuclear power, it makes sense to me. I also think that it's a good story for adults and kids alike. I do think it may be a little slow for kids to watch it.|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's , such as goodies and bad guys and a good story. It's the story of a small town , in which the residents have lived in peace and harmony for many years , until one day , the town is under attack from bandits , who are intent on driving the law abiding locals from their homes , and who are in the pay of the railroad , which wants to build its tracks in the area , and so needs the land.|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie wasn’t very good either, so I don’t have much to report. To be fair , I was distracted by the bizarre choice of venue , which is a cafe in the back of a furniture store . And the movie wasn’t very good either , so the venue was kind of irrelevant . Anyhow , Kate Winslet gives another great performance . She’s really good . She’s always really good , but she’s really, really good here .|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in French by the French director Rachid Bouchareb, you will understand why Algeria was so crucial to both French and Algerian History. The film gives a new perspective of Algeria and the Algerian revolution and also the role France had in it. I think the film is an open invitation for the French government to revisit its History and its relationship with its colonized country. The film was well done and I can recommend it to people interested in Algerian history or History in general.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1

This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that deserved an A plus plus it is this one. I saw this movie in theaters 3 times and when it came to VHS I bought 3 copies and gave them to my friends. I am a huge fan of sci-fi horror and Alien was one of the best movies ever made. I can't say I am a fan of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection because they are both too dark and not scary but Aliens and Alien are both masterpieces. Scares me to death.|0
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . I have to admit that I was seduced by the first half of this film. The story is intriguing, and the lead actress is very beautiful. However, it is only the first 75% of the movie that is good. The last 25% is a disappointing let-down that is really uninspiring and lacking in anything new. It's been done better elsewhere. Amazing movie. Really entertaining. But the ending is a bit predictable, and the main character becomes annoying after a while.|0
"A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their best and the rest of the cast , for the most part , has little to work with , the best performances coming from a young Nick Adams and Mary Ure . The plot is trite and implausible , and I can't help feeling that a better script would have been better for this . There are some amusing touches though , and the film is enjoyable enough , I suppose . Rosalind R
A very enjoyable, light comedy, with a good story and a nice balance between the main lead characters."|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I find it really good, and I'm sure most people will too! This is one of those movies that is different from most of the others, which I guess is what makes it so good. So if you're tired off seeing movies that are a copy from another movie, and are looking for a movie that's not the same thing you've seen before, this is the movie for you! I don't understand why a lot of people seem to dislike it.|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
"A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game to get a college scholarship, but his self-esteem transforms into confidence, as he and the other players find that their lives and attitudes have unexpected impacts on their families.

More reviews for The Rage in Placid Lake
Great performance by Jason Gann. But I found the rest of the movie rather annoying. Good film for teens. Darkly hilarious, this movie is a wonderful portrayal of adolescence at its best."|0
"`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure but to convey the character's motives. The movie is well written, well acted and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this movie although the plot is thin. 16/12/10--06:48: The Lone Gunmen Pilot - Pilot
This is the episode that introduced the Lone Gunmen on the X-Files. It has all the charm of the X-Files, a good cast of character and lots of fun to be had by the viewer. The story revolves around a group of computer hackers, who help Mulder in finding the truth."|0
"Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  boy goes to university, boy meets girl, boy and girl find out they're brother and sister - and you think, ""Well, that's hardly a spoiler. I can guess what it's going to be like from the title,"" you don't know what's hit you. It could be the best of films, and you still wouldn't guess anything like what it's like. And it could be the worst, but then you wouldn't expect anything from it either way."|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1

"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the not so young. It is called ""The Happiness of Kati"" and is based on a true story and was filmed in 1989 in Hungary. I saw it at a film festival in Paris last month. You will not be sorry. It will stay with you. Thank you so very much for all your good wishes for our new baby girl. I know she has already been blessed with love from all her relatives, friends and, of course, all of you who care for us."|0
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten foot pole, and that 's why I'm so glad I did. I saw this flick at 9AM at a screening on a Sunday morning, and there were no other folks in the audience with me. My only real concern was not wanting to nod off in the middle of the film. Well, I did manage to do that for a couple of moments, but I think it was mostly due to lack of sleep rather than being bored.|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , unfaithful , and self centred , and women are the poor victims . This film has a great sense of humor . It is a great comedy, and it's a shame that it did not become more successful because it was not even nominated for Oscar's . This film has some similarities with other film like 'Pillow talk' or 'The Trap' , and this is also the reason why I did not find this movie to be original . Overall , I liked this film .|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of film since 1961 with films as diverse as his 1982 cult classic Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night , the 2005 Oscar winning Grizzly Man and the 2010 Academy Award-nominated Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Now, at age 74, the acclaimed German director has released his 63th film, titled Into the Abyss , which shines a light into the dark corners of America’s prison system by examining the cases of two convicted murderers in 2001 in Conroe, TX.|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and I just love it. In my opinion, the best thing about the movie is the scenaristic, it's beautiful and the actors and actresses are the best for those roles. You should know, this is an old movie, in a black and white, which is great. It's a must see for Pride and Prejudice fans and it's not expensive at all, so, why don't you buy it ?|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model, I knew it was not a show I would want my daughter to see, so I hid it in a secret place so that when my daughter went on a trip, she would not find it. But every time I watched the show I could not get enough of it. Now my daughter has caught on to it and she is also hooked on this show. Tyra Banks is an amazing woman and a great example of an African American woman who is a leader in business.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died in a car accident . I'm still in the pain of my lost, but I'm trying to find the answer about life and death. I don't want to let her memory be forgotten by anyone. I'm also trying to keep in touch with people who cared for her as I did, to make a group that can share her life and love . I hope this page will be a page for her memory and also her life.|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I've seen on television. Especially the opening 20 seconds. I would have given anything to have done something like this for the 2007 Festival of Music and Art here in NZ. Posted by: Paul Corfield Godfrey | 02/02/2009 at 11:00 AM
Thanks for your comments! I agree that this is a wonderful way to start the series. I can imagine that you would have put a lot of effort into it if you did it at the 2007 Festival of Music and Art."|0
"10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I have only seen one thus far ( Wim Wenders ), but if the rest are at all as good as the first, then it is a must see. Post by josie andrews » Sun May 21, 2006 10:14 pm
I agree - that's an interesting concept, and if I were in the area I would check it out for sure. Thanks for letting us know about it, and the name of the documentary!"|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much. This particular movie is one of the few exceptions, however. For those of you out there who like lesbians, you'll probably be disappointed. The entire movie has only about ten minutes of lesbian sex. Otherwise, however, it's extremely enjoyable. If you are looking for a great lesbian story with lots of sex, then look elsewhere. This one is much more interested in the characters than in their sex. The sex is just a bonus.|0
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because it is very much more affordable . When they came out, I had the first few episodes on Dvd . I was hooked on it immediately and bought every season on DVD since then . The show is excellent , and you have some great performances from the entire cast . This is really a top notch tv series. I have seen every episode. The writers, cast and production staff do a really excellent job with each new episode.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows Lazarus a former blues musician who after the loss of his son has turned towards God . One day he happens upon Rae, a sexually abused woman whose boyfriend has left her for his drug dealer . Lazarus decides to take her in and attempt to “cure” her sex addiction with the only method he knows how . I will admit that this was not one of the better acting performances I have ever seen but with that being said the cast was great and the dialogue is very interesting .|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time period does not seem to be the right venue for such wittiness . What you will get here are some good songs , some good dance routines & some good acting . And this movie has all three . So do give this movie a chance . Its worth seeing . The movie may not be 100 % accurate , but for a movie it does not matter . What matters is how much you liked it and for me I like it .|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has heart and that’s all you want from movies. So yes, you have to be in the right mood for this movie and you know what? You have to want it to be great for it to be. I didn’t want it to be great but I was willing to go with it. And I loved it so much that it reminded me why I fell in love with film in the first place , why I wanted to do this in the first place….|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . . . that you are `` Blue, '' that you are, in fact, bluer than me . . . but you don't like me at all. You're not blue,'' he said finally. When I am in the blue mood I can do nothing but be blue. What do they call this color--this blue of the sea? I think of it as the blue of distance, of farthings that are never seen.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a film to inform us that they were a thing. It's been awhile since we've seen any movies like this. If it were not for this film I wouldn't even know there was any such thing. It's a great story about a father and son's journey to be reunited after the boy's mother, the girlfriend of the cowboy dad has been killed. It was very emotional and heartfelt. A beautifully crafted western that is very much worth seeing!|0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this on Netflix , but it's also on Amazon Prime as well . I found this movie to be really funny . . . . and sad . . . as it's a documentary about two people in their 60s whose parents had been married to each other for over 50 years . When they finally decide to divorce after all these years . . . both kids try to figure out why . . . and both come to a conclusion that their parents didn't even know how to have a good marriage .|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks 1939 film `` Only Angels Have Wings '' in it's atmosphere. This time , though , the location is Canada and not Mexico as in Hawks movie. I enjoyed this one. The print is excellent , and the film also has the added attraction for me, of a beautiful actress in the starring role . She's Jean Parker , by the way , who in my book rates with Faye Wray , Ginger Rogers and Janet Gaynor as the sexiest women in films.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1

I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of the ``Matrix'' and it's the most stylish movie I've seen so far this year . This is a must see for anyone interested in special effects , and an eye opener to the possibilities of modern movie technology . You are a medical investigator called in to observe a prisoner suspected of committing the most horrific crimes . A serial killer who has killed 23 victims so far and you have to help find a way to keep this prisoner alive long enough so that they can find a cure for him .|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , the cinematography and editing in some of the scenes were really good . One scene in particular stood out , in which a man is running down a street and the camera is looking at his feet running on the ground while the shot is moving towards him . That is not something that is easy to do . There is a real good balance in the story between the comedy, drama and suspense elements of the story . The story and characters are well developed .|0
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The mind is a beautiful place and the mind of a serial killer is just as intriguing . The Cell focuses on one serial killer, Marie( Jennifer Lopez) as she is interviewed by a prison psychiatrist ( Vince Vaughan). This is a very different movie than you might expect but it's so well made and well done that it's worth a watch. The Cell has a dark and gritty feel to it with some scenes that are very disturbing.|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White girl story , this is just good old Southern fun. So, in short , I don't think you'll be disappointed! Having said that, you can't help but compare this with the original . It's a bit more gory for starters but the movie is just a little bit lame . I think if they did a straight remake , I'd be happy. The original is just a classic . Still , you get some fun moments and some good scarey moments !|0
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled such a theme. However I was hoping for a much better storyline . The story of a woman and her quest for love. The story of a woman who dares to dream. A dream that has always been shattered. Will the man who she marries be the man she has dreamt of or will her dream be shattered once again? This is a film about an urban woman who decides to do things for herself without any male help.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a solid plot and a great supporting cast. The opening sequence of the Lone Ranger's origins is quite good. Clayton Moore makes for an excellent Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels is a great sidekick, Tonto, who is just as good a character as the Lone Ranger. John Hart, who has a minor role, does a great job of portraying Cavendish, the Ranger's arch nemesis. Hart was a character actor from the early 20's, who had a distinguished career that lasted until his death in 1979.|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it many times to understand the plot . This movie is an art work . I loved this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. I was so impressed after seeing the trailer. When i saw it finally it turned out way better then the trailer. I don't believe this was the worst movie of 2010 at all. I thought it was good and I didn't get confused or anything like other people say they did. It's a very confusing movie though.|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
"Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . I'm a libertarian myself so I thought I'd get a few things off my chest . First off the show was hilarious . The last 10 minutes is what makes the whole episode . It's a 2 part joke that starts off as ""hey look Al is fat ""and then it goes into the fact that Al Gore has some of the worst luck in human history . If you look at this from a libertarian point of view it's pretty funny."|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me . I love a lot of films but I like to support the independent scene more than any other. You have a lot to offer and there 's so much talent out there that needs support. I have been a screenwriter for 4 years and have completed 6 scripts so I know a little about the process. My writing has been described as realistic and raw. I believe that is a product of my background and real world experience.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I never saw the movie in theaters and somehow it got over looked when it first came out on Netflix. I didn’t think much of it when I saw the Netflix listing but it looked like something my wife and I might enjoy. I was a little worried when the movie began as it was set in a prison cell and it looked like it was going to be one of those artsy independent film type things. It quickly changed and started to feel like a much more traditional crime thriller.|0
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in an elevator where two women are in a conversation. The elevator is getting crowded, two more enter and it is getting really hot. Then one of the women opens the elevator door and all five of them get out. I don`t think any one has tried to find that scene in this version. There are several things that are changed in the 2012 remake. Some things that were changed I can agree on, but some others I cannot.|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's not to say it wasn 't going to get bigger, it probably was going to, but surely it could have been handled a bit better. The people in charge of Iraq and Afghanistan don 't have a plan to get us out. We 're spending tens of billions a year, losing lives every month, and the end doesn 't seem to be coming any closer. It 's not like it was a secret that invading Iraq and Afghanistan wasn 't going to be an easy thing.|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile relationships with each other. And how a moment in time can change the dynamic between us and how we move forward. Also how the past can affect us all in different ways ! I would like to give a shout out to my Mom ! I know she is watching . It's not easy but I really do appreciate all you do ! I also have to give a shout out to all you Moms and Dads out there !|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the actors are Wonderful . I think everyone is going to enjoy it. It has action , romance , humor , and great acting. I did not expect a movie like that. I love it! I will watch it again. Very good movie, great cast, story and music. I did not expect much from this film. I was surprised and very satisfied. An excellent performance by the entire cast! This was a great rendition of the age old story.|0
"Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's circle. I've even heard it called an ""adult's cartoon"" because of the sexual content (not nudity). Well, adults do have sexual lives (gasp! ), right? The story lines are clever, witty and very adult. I'm 31 and still laugh out loud every time I watch this series. This is what cartoons are all about. You have no idea. Daria is a teenage girl who attends High School in the town of Lawndale."|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of crime with that of the ordinary family life . A young man named Joe, who is a petty thief , strives to get out of the clutches of crime and go to a normal life . He realizes that he does not want to be a gangster and gets involved in a robbery to his boss to make enough money to go to a remote island in Australia and start a new life. But everything goes awry and the police pursue Joe, who gets caught between the crime world and ordinary life .|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . And the reason is that this album is an absolute classic . Sometimes , I do not understand how people can say this one of her best work. But in reality , I think that they are all amazing , they are all gems and each of them has something that touches me . This one is a bit more difficult to understand , but that is also the reason that I like . It is one of my favorites from Carpenter because it is different than all the others .|0
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his books , and I would shop around the shelves for anything else that caught my eye . I wanted to see what else was out there , and what it all entailed . So I purchased a couple books and started reading . One of the books that I purchased was called Bottoms Up . I found it fascinating to read as it went through many different fetishes . I also found it a little sad that some people actually have these fetishes .|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress . She's one of my favourite Actress . She can act very good . I can watch this movie very often . I like it so much . Amy Jo Johnson is one of my favourite Actress . This movie is very good . I can watch it often. This is one of my favourite teen movies from the 2010s. I like this teen movie . I like this teen movie . I love the actors . I think this movie is great . I think it's romantic .|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. I watched the whole series and was totally enthralled. It was extremely well written, acted, filmed, shot and directed, and, as with all good drama, had the viewer engrossed and eager to get back to watch more. I found the storyline engrossing and interesting, and not once did I find the acting poor, the story unrealistic or feel that I'd been misled. I thought the whole thing was fantastically presented, and if anything the ending, while sad, felt right and was believable.|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an erotic film , yes , but it’s not one that is just trying to push the envelope and get people hot and bothered , like so many porn films do today. This is a simple story that involves a woman who takes a break from her boyfriend only to find out that she misses him . She takes a trip to his place to see if anything can be worked out. They find themselves in a situation where all they can do is bang and bang some more .|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it's an enjoyable little film. Writer/director J.R. Reher makes the best of his micro-budget, with an attractive cast who look and sound the parts, and a nice attention to detail which adds to the story and atmosphere. The story is an intriguing mixture of genres - it's basically an action movie about a man trying to save his wife, with elements of romantic comedy and horror - and it succeeds because Reher is confident enough in what he's trying to do.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the final one that aired tonight) it's a bit hard for me to remember what I want to mention. So, just going off memory, I would have to say my favorite episode of Season 11 is probably "" The One With All the Cheesecakes "" and "" The One Where Ross Dates A Student."" I know, I know they are not exactly the best episodes but they are my favorites and that's all you can really ask for, right?

The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . I hope to find some more Dogma films out there and see where it all started . I would also like to find out more about other countries and there Dogma movements . There are a lot of great films out there , just waiting to be seen. I think Fuckland is one of those films and i highly recommend it to you . I am really glad it was sent to me for a review . I am thankful for being able to watch such a great movie .|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
"I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is shiny or that water is wet . This movie is a 1985 British-French production that's basically about some guy that's in an accident and becomes a zombie . But this movie really isn't as simple as I just described it to you . The movie is about zombies and vampires . It's about a group of friends that take a trip through Europe and get into all kinds of trouble . The movie is directed by Neil Jordan who is famous for the movie "" Mona Lisa"" ."|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I had expected. There's still plenty of blood and violence in the film but it's not over the top like I had assumed it would be from the trailers I saw. Instead Just Before Dawn focuses more on the characters and the setting than it does the horror and violence. That's not to say it's boring, there's a surprising amount of action, but that it's better than most of these slasher movies.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (formerly from En Vogue) being in it. There were a lot of big named artists that did some of my favorite songs from the 70's and early 80s. I have to look up all of the songs they did that I remember, but it was a great show . I just saw that they had a follow-up show last year and hopefully it is coming back soon. If you missed it on PBS I would highly recommend buying the DVD.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant stream of gushing about it. I didn't much like the first film, so I was already in a bad mood when I saw the second film. So let me make one thing clear: I think it's rubbish. However, this is more than just a personal reaction; I think there is something fundamentally wrong with what it is. I think it has to do with narrative and what it is trying to accomplish. My first point is that it fails as an adaptation.|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed the beginning due to late arrival!). I wanted to see everything, to try and pick up on every detail that had escaped me, which was quite a lot! I'd recommend watching this several times as well as reading a review as I feel that you can't get the full picture without the review. The characters are so multi layered, and you really get to see the different sides to them, and I loved that!|0
"I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been looking for a dvd of it, I was not a fan of the original movie. I've seen a lot of movies in my day but I've never seen a movie like ""Hellcab"". The acting, directing, scripting, and all the other aspects were so well done that it really gave you a feel that you were a passenger on the cab. It was a very realistic and moving movie that had me feeling everything the cab driver was feeling."|0
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following in the footsteps of Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Scream and countless other examples . In fact , this is one of the very best examples of the type I've seen : it's scary without resorting to ghosts or monsters ; its characters are sharply written and played and it's full of interesting ideas and images . One such image is that opening shot of a lorry parked up in a darkened field with a girl in a white wedding dress on the back.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as Noir. This was a dark and cynical genre that featured down on their luck anti-heroes like Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe and other detectives who were all too human. The noir detectives had all the trappings of a hard drinking, womanizing life but still managed to be honorable and moral men. Even when they had to do immoral acts they did it for the greater good. One of those characters was Richard Diamond, Private Detective. In fact Diamond was probably the prototypical American private eye.|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it, I love it ! Sweet, funny, sad, the actors are doing a really great job and there's always something new, unexpected ! I don't want to say a lot about it, you'll have to discover the movie by yourself ! I'd really love to see what's happening next, a sequel would make my day ! Posted in Movies and TV series, Non classé on 6 March 2013 by Mag. ← Obligation !|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa and the apartheid era. But it is good to be reminded, because apartheid was something that could so easily become an abstraction. That it did, and that it did so in so many places, is one reason why we are still discussing apartheid. In this sense, the setting is the most obvious and the most important feature of Red Dust and this alone makes it worth watching. It is a political thriller, a thriller set in a political milieu.|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . My parents had gone into the city, and I snuck along with an older friend. The only film I'd ever seen that was remotely close to the subject matter was The African Queen. But it was a very different story, and even more different setting. There was, however, one important common element; both films were directed by two of the greatest directors of our time, John Ford and Robert Wise.|0
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against Yankee aggressors bent on plundering, looting, and burning their homes. Along with the women & children, a band of local patriots are left to fend for themselves without military protection in this, their own country, as Union soldiers have captured the garrison and all able bodied defenders. GENERAL SPANKY, who has a love affair with the youngest daughter, MARY QUEEN, decides to stay in the area to aid these patriots.|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , my older brother and I would go with our dad to work on weekends. We would follow him in our dad's 1974 Ford Bronco. He was a heavy-set man, so the seats in the old 70's truck were always a little small for him , but not too small for us. My brother and I would climb into the front seats with our dad and we would laugh and talk the whole ride over to work.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning to end and so far we didn't find a better address in the whole world. We love the people, we love this house, it was our dream to live in a house as beautiful as a film house and we finally did it. It's a beautiful location and very peaceful, away from the maddening city crowd. We have lived in 10 different places across the country and this is our best home and we are glad to have found it at this address.|0
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Hunt 2006 ) is a classic of American humour writing and has achieved a permanent place in American literature. But while the books have their readers, I have to say that I’ve always had a hard time getting in touch with them. They just aren’t my kind of story. It’s the old adage that “to each his own” and I understand that there are plenty of people who like these books. Unfortunately I just don’t see it myself.|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It kept us laughing every single day. The show kept the funniness at a high level. We were not bored during the show at all. We are glad that we was able to watch. I love that the show brought a lot of joy to those who watch it, and we were very happy to be a part of it. I am not a black person but I was still entertained. I laughed very hard while watching this series.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 100 on 100 . It gives you something which we rarely find in today's cinema. To me it was more or less like 'The Graduate'. I just hope that the movie does very well and people come to know about it . One of my favorite films for sure. The best film I have seen for the last decade. It is beautiful in every aspect. The screenplay, cinematography, acting and music are all exquisite. Must watch for cine-aesthete.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of the town. I remember those days and miss them now. It was my Dad's hobby too. He loved airplanes, and I still have his collection of airplane pictures, posters, photos. Nice post. My dad worked at United Airways in the 1950's as a pilot and he took a similar photo from the cockpit, which I have. I think he also had photos from airport terminals. I love looking at these photos.|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . We have to ask ourselves how come ? There is no doubt that DVD has been a success . Now everybody can see and buy their favorite movies . The only drawback is that it's costly , as they sell them for about $20.00 dollars each . It is also a drawback that not all the movies were made available . I will give some of those tittles so everybody can see for themselves . Some of these movies on this list I have never seen .|0
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are about to travel to the west. When the Mormons' leader is accidentally killed, the travelers take his place and pretend to lead them to the holy land. They use the horse traders' horses and supplies as well as the money that the travelers have to buy the supplies. The horse traders eventually discover the scheme and attempt to escape, but they end up trapped with the travelers on a desolate plain where no help can reach them.|0
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets look like the same sets used for the sets of Ben-Hur , including the Colosseum, a couple of temples and other buildings. Also notice how this is the only movie that the famous actress Susan Hayward did not get an Oscar nomination for; in this film she plays Valeria, a prostitute who later falls in love with Ben-Hur. Hayward plays the role with great passion and intensity, but she gets no nomination at the Academy Awards, probably due to her character's status as an immoral prostitute.|0
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's Death . His Father 's work lives on as well. Terrific doc on a filmmaker who deserves the respect of the genre. An amazing, heartfelt doc about a man who made his life out of his passion. An inspiration to every filmmaker out there and a great way to pay tribute to the great man. Movies like this one makes me appreciate documentaries and the passion of the makers. I think it is very touching how this film is about a loving man who loved movies and his work.|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surfacey characterisation and a rather silly and unconvincing plot. Still, the music and dance routines make it all worthwhile, even if this isn't quite up to 'The Boy from Oz'. In terms of the story - a young Irish lad named Pete (Jake Canuso) leaves his homeland in search of a better life in New York where he meets and befriends a young waitress called Tessie (Anna McDonald). After many trials and tribulations Pete becomes the most successful and famous of the Ziegfeld Follies stars.|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a man , a great director , but also of a country , America , and the entire human race . A vision of what is to come that will haunt your thoughts for years to come . I think if you take a good look at it , this film is an exploration and explanation of what we all really are at the root and how it all came about . If you don't get this you have missed the boat .|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Egyptian artist,who I have known since 1993 when I met her on a trip to Egypt.In 1997 I bought my first piece of genuine,high quality Egyptian papyrus,and it still hangs proudly on the wall of the lounge of my home . I have since bought further items from Egyptian Papyrus . I have always been totally impressed by the quality of the papyrus,its artwork and the efficiency and speed with which these items have reached my door.|0
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends & Neighbors , to write and direct The Shape of Things . The film is a story of love, obsession and manipulation in which two characters change each others lives forever. Paul Rudd and Rachel Weisz play a seemingly typical college professor and student who fall in love, only to discover their love and attraction for each other has the potential to lead to the downfall of both characters and all their relationships. This is a darker and more disturbing movie than either of LaBute's previous works.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's. It is an old fashioned kind of movie in that sense, I guess that is why I like it so much. For a student of that time, it is not hard to put yourself into the shoes of the main actors. Some of the scenes are fun to watch as they are based on true life experiences. The acting is not that good, but who cares when you are young and have fun. And it has the right atmosphere and soundtrack to complete the whole picture.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my taste at some moments) but no less compelling for that ; an excellent piece of thriller and mystery. It’s not the best that I’ve ever read, yet it keeps you turning the pages to the very last one. The plot is very clever, I have to admit. You’re left wondering, what the hell is going on ? and who can be trusted? and what the hell is the author trying to say ?|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one. The acting is fine, there are some great lines and situations in the dialogs and the storyline, and I think the plot is rather good. I watched it a dozen of times when I was 25 years old, and still I enjoy it very much today, some 30 years later. This is a film I would recommend to anybody who is tired of all the CGI-driven big-budget Hollywood blockbusters out there.|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right . But the thing is this one has no qualms about killing innocent bystanders if it gets in the way of him doing God 's work. And that's the problem . We've all read about those crazy people killing the doctor's that are performing late term abortions. There's something about killing a person that they disagree with. Well it seems there's something about killing innocent people on the sly that these folks like to do.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must have lead . It's not often I give a ten for a movie but this was a perfect 10 from the start to the finish . It's not your usual film with some stupid action or special effects and a lot of nonsense story line . Just an excellent film with an excellent story and excellent performances from all involved . I'd love to see some more films made by this cast and director with this story . I will definitely purchase the dvd to enjoy this story again and again .|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe not . But here goes . I can say it is a story told by someone who is not sure who they are . This is the second time I’ve heard this music and , for the most part , I liked it . I like the music . I like the melody line and , as a whole , I like the album. The only thing I didn’t really like was the voice .|0
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in Spain. I am glad to know about this film and I hope to get hold of a copy. This documentary is very nice. I wish it will be more accessible to the public. I was very happy to learn about Erasmus students and their problems, in my opinion, this kind of movies is more important than commercial movies. I have enjoyed very very much of this documentary. The Erasmus experience has been showed very good, I can say I have lived the same.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love, one which I'm grateful to have seen. From the very beginning, this documentary hooks you with a very well done opening montage, which includes archival footage interspersed with modern footage , which makes for some very nice continuity. We get a good sense that this movie is very serious about covering the topic it is going to present, and the filmmakers have done an excellent job of presenting the information in a very clear and concise manner, which keeps you hooked the whole time.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy of it there. I was expecting a film about the man himself, Akhenaten, but it is a drama about an art historian in modern day Egypt who finds Akhenaten on a visit to the museum. Apart from the fact that he is dead for about 3500 years he is the spit and image of Akhenaten. The story concerns the relationship between the two men and between the art historian's son and his friend's son.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, there's very little that makes sense. On the other hand, the thing is really fun. In the film, a series of killings has people in the town of Mooneyhead (I swear this place does exist) very worried - and when one of them has a vision about a possible future victim, things really get messed up. A detective is brought in to deal with things, but things just keep getting worse, as the killings start to multiply.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has so much comedy and so much heart that it needs to be recognized. This is one show that has not missed a beat. Please give it a chance and give it its due credit. This show is my absolute favorite, and it has not missed a beat in all these years!! It has its own loyal following, but it does not get nearly the credit it deserves. I just can not say enough good things about this show.|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story . It's an intense rollercoaster ride . I would like to thank Netgalley and publisher St Martin's Press for an advance reading copy in exchange for an honest review . This is the second book I have read and I absolutely loved it . It is very well written . The characters are well defined . The story flows and you can't put it down . A must read!!!!!!|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July of 2018. It’s about 4 young people , one a girl , who are brought together because of a murder. It’s 1980-something , and the 4 go from being strangers to close friends , but when they go to New York for the weekend they discover the murder may have been one of their friends and things go from bad to worse , they get into a car accident , and the story continues.|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's to gory for my taste. I think it 's a bad sign when the actors are more famous than the character. I do make exceptions for a few select shows. The most recent addition to this list is Breaking Bad. I have a confession to make, I don 't like the main character. This is not a reflection of the character Walter White. I really don 't know what it means, but the show is so well done that he is easily the least interesting person on the show.|0
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1

I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , it made me smile and laugh ! I am so happy to see this story about friendship and family. I wish we could have more of this kind of movies like this in the theaters. It is a movie you will not be sorry you have seen. The best part of this movie is the friendship between these four women. I think this kind of friendship are very rare. I wish I had 4 girlfriends like these women .|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two Weeks Notice'. But, it turned out to be funnier than 'The In-Laws', with more depth. At times, it was almost a satire, but in the end, it kept the balance. The movie is well casted. Sandra Bullock has a good screen presence. I liked her better than Harrison Ford or Hugh Grant. It is fun to watch them spar with one another in the movie. I thought Hugh Grant's performance was excellent and the movie was better than I expected.|0
The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Map. '' These signs are there for the visitors and also tourists of the beautiful country. The signs are there to guide the tourists so that they can find the way of the place. It is not compulsory for everyone that they should always go on the roads that have signs. There are times when the travellers do not see all the signs on the roads. They do not pay proper attention. It is always advisable for the travellers to stay on the side of the road and not cross it.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish film ( the other one was Girl with the Dragon tattoo 1-1) . But since I was in Sweden last month , I wanted to watch a Swedish movie and my sister suggested me a horror movie . I don’t usually watch scary films , but this one wasn’t anything I wasn’t expecting . The only thing that kept me attached to the screen was the main character played by Mira Grosin . She is incredible .|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was based on an actual real life incident. It turns out to be true. This movie is based on real life incident which came to the limelight in 1995 when there was a serial killing of 3 female students by Bal Thackeray’s son who was the editor of a tabloid. One of the victims was also a journalist and she had the courage to reveal Bal Thackeray’s son’s involvement in the killings and expose him in public which made him commit the suicide.|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . It's also one of those rare westerns where the good guy gets his woman. The script, by Warren and Richard B. Schafer , isn't especially novel--it's a tale of a rancher (Victor Mature ) and a cowboy (Robert Hutton ) trying to get rich by running cattle through Comancheria . And there's even an Indian raid, which is about as close to a cliché as they come. But Mature has the kind of good-guy appeal that makes him a sympathetic lead.|0
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The firm is having financial problems and is having trouble getting insurance. Brian has the bright idea to break into the insurance firm's headquarters to get his company new policies. Suddenly Brian has a change of heart when he realizes that he is about to break into the same company where his sister, Karen ( Susan O'Connell ), works. He then decides to give her a heads up before breaking in. But he forgets to bring his phone and can't remember Karen's new phone number since she moved .|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Each of the three films was made late in the master filmmaker's career, when his health and vision were failing and he was often relegated to second-unit scenes. Wagon-master and Sergeant Rutledge were the work of a Ford who was still able to write memorable screenplays, with Wagonmaster based on a novella by Frank O'Rourke. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was adapted by Willis Goldbeck from an Edward Anhalt original.|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just good - it's the best comedy currently on US TV. The series started life with a weak premise - that of a lazy man and his working wife who have to share their apartment with Carrie's overbearing father. The show soon settled into its groove and by now it has found its comic stride. There's a perfect balance between pathos and laughs and you're rooting for Carrie and Doug from the very start.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some years ago , and decided they needed to remake the great classic 80s action movie DIE HARD with a new star, and new twists and turns of the story . This 2008 version stars Bruce Willis , in a role similar to his JOHN McLAINE role , but now he's playing the role of New York Detective john MCCLAINE . The plot is a little more complex than the original 1988 film , but the basic premise is McClaine must save his daughter from terrorists who've siezed an office building high-rise.|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
"Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines the good and bad characters and situations into the one storyline, which works for the film as you are never left wondering who to actually support or sympathise with as a result of this, making Two Hands far more engaging that it could be if the filmmakers decided to stick with one side or the other. Recommended for fans of Australian crime films. 7/10 Bethany Cox
Two Hands was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment on June 27, 2018. The DVD is NOT REGION CODED."|0

I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am 22 years old and this is the best movie so far . It is a movie for the all ages .I would recommend this movie to all of my family and friends. A really good movie, but I would not call it a kids film. A really good movie, but I would not call it a kids film. My daughter is only 10, and she was freaking scared at the end, but she also said it was the best movie ever.|0
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled . i love the relationship between the two sisters. i am really glad they didn't kill off the mother it would've been too depressing . hope it goes for another 5 or 6 seasons . I love this show and can't wait for the rest of the episodes this season and the next season to air. It's one of the best shows on now and it's so good that it could easily be one of the best drama shows of all time.|0
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store , i think i was working the counter and it was right before closing time , and one of those guys who come in like every week to rent a movie was in , and we were just chatting and then i was like oh i like your shirt its really cute . and he was like , thanks , my wife made it , and i was like , wow , that is really cute , its really nice , i like the design , i think its really pretty , do you have anymore ?|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time with this rubbish. How can a TV company waste the opportunity to make something good out of a really good book? I'd rather watch an episode of Jeremy Kyle or Jeremy Clarkson. At least those are more entertaining and are based on real situations. Anyone who watches this crap deserves everything they get. You only have to read the first 5 pages of the first book to know this isn't a TV series you want to watch.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw most of these reviews before i watched it . But after watching it , i just had to leave a review of my own . I think the reason most of the other reviews are so harsh is because people are comparing it to all the other disney movies . Disney is known for its magical and fairytale endings , not the gore and horror . I don't see why they have to compare everything to every other Disney movie .|0
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's classic story, one of the most popular stage plays to arrive here since the war. It has a witty and clever dialogue and it is produced by an English company under the direction of the veteran playwright and actor, Robert Morley, whose long and varied career has given him an impressive knowledge of literature and drama. It has been a long while since the play, written in 1885, made its debut here, but the story still holds strong appeal.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this duo is very professional and the songs that are put out are well written . These guys truly love playing music and it comes across when listening to the songs . I'm so pleased to see this duo have their music out in public . I have had the opportunity to play a couple songs with them live and I can say they are a great band . Well done guys keep it up !! Thank you very much for your comment. We appreciate your kind words.|0
"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexually liberated woman , I could remember my college years . I had a roommate who was pretty much the Alice in this flick . I always found her a strange duck , but as I watched this flick a light bulb came on in my head and I realized she was probably a lesbian . Now I don't care what people are into , but at the time I was so naive I was shocked by her ""odd behavior"" ."|0
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this book not expecting much I mean I had read one of her books before and it was good but I didn't like it like I do this one. So the book was good it kept my interested but as I was reading it I had some issues and one of them was that the story line was kind of bland it wasn't bad it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be. As you read it and get closer and closer to the end.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to make the small, personal movies, the Westerns. In 1962, he released, `` The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,'' one of his best westerns. It is, in part, a mythical western. In 1895, a new territory, Arizona, is about to become a state. John Wayne, a ranch owner, plays Tom Doniphon, a strong, independent, rough and ready, good man, in an untamed territory.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we laughed and cried .It was the first movie to come out on video as far as I know. It was a good start to the movie industry.It was good to see the movie in its complete form not just clips of it.It should have been longer it was very short but it was good. I recommend it. I would not buy it again just because we bought it so long ago. We got it at Wal-Mart. I got it on the 4th of July.|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a realistic perspective of a single parent struggling with her kids. Rose also showed that there was more going on in the movie than just the kids. She brought a lot more drama to the storyline that I didn't expect. I also like to watch movies that are set in my hometown of Miami , Florida, and the cast did not disappoint in this movie. I was wondering if any of the cast is from Miami. The storyline was great but the movie left me wanting more!|0
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe, I never felt this kind of attachment to any character. I can't pinpoint what it is about this film but it is just great and I would recommend it anyone. Rosemarys Baby was a very intense movie. It's plot kept me in suspense the whole movie. A young couple moves into a new apartment, and a mysterious older couple starts to become very friendly. They eventually invite them over for a party one night where they meet a very strange older couple.|0
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Mostly gore . I think the filmmakers did a very good job on the gore in the film , very well done . The acting was pretty good for an independent film , but there were a few times it went off the rails, but not too badly . I like the concept of this killer , I'm not really a big fan of masks or supernatural movies . But if you are looking for some gore , this movie has some really good kills in it .|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one he directed in 3-D. I 've seen this film twice now, one time in 3-D, and once not in 3-D. It was interesting to view this film twice and see the differences in the two screenings. The first time I watched the movie, I viewed it from the 3-D glasses that were made by the studio for the movie. The second time I watched the movie, I viewed it through the regular flat screen.|0
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something that was not only well put together but that kept me entertained through out the whole movie! I am a 21 yr old boy and found it just as enjoyable as i would have if i had been 8 yrs old. As for those who rated this below 6/10, i think you missed the point that it is not meant to be an action thriller. If it was you wuld be expecting to see something a bit more fast paced! i loved this movie, the story was great.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a great film, especially considering the film's small budget. The film stars Karen Cliche who plays Dana. It's a great story. She is a beautiful girl and her friends are the most beautiful girls I have ever seen together. They're like little dolls, except they aren't plastic. The plot was a little slow at first but it picks up quickly. I loved it and it makes me want to wear more make-up and be more beautiful, just like Dana and her friends!|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood travels to battlefields throughout the United States, there is nothing that quite compares to walking the path of those who fought for our liberty. In May, I led 28 of our 10th Grade Boys on an incredible 3 day trek across 20 miles of the battlefield at Gettysburg. It is hard to imagine all of the people and events that occurred on this small piece of land. Even more difficult to understand is that this is one battle out of the 50 some that occurred across the country in the Civil War.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch up with all the gags I missed. A great film, well worth seeing, even if you don't like animation. Good for the whole family, but not quite up there with The Incredibles as far as I'm concerned - it's a bit too slow for that. It's still a great film and I really liked it. I will definitely be buying this one on DVD when it's out.|0
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. Great acting from everyone. The story is one that I've heard in a few movies but each time it's different and well done. As I recall , the original film was made in the early 1950s . I'm not sure how close this was to it but it was good. I saw this movie some years ago. I enjoyed it and found it to be entertaining. Glad you're enjoying the 350 or so movies I'm putting up each week.|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' in vlissingen, holland. a wonderful film. i hope there will be the possibility of buying the DVD, because i'm sure it will be a best seller. thank you! The movie is so touching I can't express my feelings enough. I saw the movie yesterday in New York City and loved it. A very moving and touching film that will make you reflect on your life and who is really in control. Great work. I was at the screening in NYC yesterday.|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time by it, because the drama and the story line was really entertaining. I loved every episode of this show. The show was very good, it was entertaining and interesting. The show is a fun and entertaining tv show and it can be a show that people of all ages could watch. Americans next top model is fun because the show is about a girl competing to be the best model and it is also fun because of the drama.|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies of the past few years. There are some really good moments here that are almost guaranteed to bring a smile to your face , but what really sets this film apart is Zellweger 's remarkable performance as the wide-eyed and innocent title character. The film begins as a soap opera-like murder mystery that soon becomes an absurd romantic comedy. This sudden shift in tone is jarring at first but then the film settles in to become one of the most enjoyable movies to come out in the past few months.|0
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I would like to hear again and again ..... the same way my mom says it to my dad and me, as my husband says to me, as my teachers used to say, as my boss says. I've said it before in other posts, but I think that it needs to be said again and again. First of all ...... Don't feel bad. I'm not here to criticize you or anything.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . I think this movie would be good to see with anybody. It wasn't anything scary and it didn't have lots of gore. The actors were all good at acting. I thought that the music was really good and added alot to the movie . The story was very good too. The story was about a guy that had the power to travel through time . It was also about the people that worked with him . They were trying to stop a terrorist attack.|0
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``Once Upon a Time in the West"". A band of killers on a train attack a woman with her two children in the bedroom of their wagon as the woman tries to defend herself and her kids with her gun. A lone passenger in another wagon tries to help and is killed as well. At the same time the train is being raided by a small group of outlaws who kill the passengers, take the money and ride off leaving the train on the tracks with no hope of repair."|0
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The show was the most successful show at Radio City Music Hall and broke its 6 year attendance record . The show ran from 1998-2000. It then went out on the road in a smaller version for the next 4 years after its New York run ended . The tour was very successful in its own right , but nothing like the impact it had in New York where the show had a record 223 consecutive sell out shows . The video is the 2004 touring version of the show .|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my face film . But it had it's moments . And the film was ok but it didn't blow my mind. This was just an okay flick. I enjoyed it because I like Eric Roberts, but it was too slow for me. I had to fast forward some parts because it dragged and I lost interest. Kane- The Movie. Not bad, not great. Pretty standard for this genre. Wouldn't recommend. A decent enough thriller for the genre, but not without fault.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . My favorite film of all time is Once Upon a Time in America . I don't know. I'd have to put a few of them in the Top 1000. There are so many of them I've never seen or only seen clips of it. I think I would put Once Upon a Time in the West up there but that's the only one that's really a must see for me. I thought this topic was for movies.|0
"Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. The story of deception and murder, and its consequences for the innocent, is told with great flair and humor by a superlative group of people. I have seen the film twice, and can hardly wait to see it again. ""Wonderful! One of the best stories and screenplays of our time. This is as good a movie as I've ever seen."" ""I saw it the first time at the New York Film Festival."|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . The plot is so stupid , it's fun . The characters are idiotic , hilarious . If you can't laugh at this , you have no soul . This short is great ! I loved this film. It is so stupid . You gotta give it a 5. I loved the characters. I loved the acting . It's one of the best shorts . You have to see this. The film is amazing. Great short. The acting is amazing.|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost'' fame) is sent by his father (Dabbs Greer) to work in the garage of a local electronics repairman (Darryl Richard ) in hopes of improving Brian's behavior. While there Brian stumbles upon the secret of invisibility and accidentally becomes invisible when trying to use it on another boy as a prank. Unfortunately the invisibility also causes him to fall victim to a couple of bullies who use their powers against Brian.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous rock musician David Bowie . But he refused . When he read the script he did not understand anything . So the parts went to Peter Stormare and Jim Sturgess . But I can not imagine Bowie as the leader who does not understand a single word. I'm glad he refused , because we had a fantastic film . David Levinson is played by Richard Gere . He is trying to warn Washington about the alien attack , but without success .|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to get an ADA service dog. Cartman’s new dog, Sparky, seems like a sweet pup but when Cartman discovers what he’s been doing when he thinks nobody is around, he is devastated. He decides to put his dog to the test to prove his innocence but he may find he is mistaken. I don’t really have that much to say about this one because I found it kind of lacking but I did think the dog was awesome.|0
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a wonderful , charming movie . A movie that brings tears to my eyes . The music is so lovely . And the story is just so amazing ! I have been watching it for a couple of times .I just can not stop watching it . I like it so so so much . I'd give it 1/100 . It's that good ! This was the first foreign movie that I liked. I've seen a lot of movies and this is definitely my favorite.|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it take you over and carry you with it to another place. There’s almost nothing more rewarding as a spectator of films. But to have that kind of an experience, there are two things that have to come together. One is having a talented film maker that has the ability to transport the viewer away, and the other is the viewer being willing to let go, suspend belief, and go with the film, whatever it’s going to take to be successful.|0
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy . His facial expressions and gestures as he watched the drama unfold , made me crack up each week! He definitely made that show more entertaining and fun to watch. His facial expressions alone should have won an Emmy! I can't say that about many characters in a TV show. I do not know if Chris is reading these comments , but I had to tell him how great he is and I hope he gets more recognition in future for all his work !|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV movie that no one would really want to watch .'' And to be perfectly honest,I did have my own preconceived notions about what this film would be. When the film finally got released last year,I rented it on VHS from my local Video Store.The movie was about 2 teenage kids whose parents were going through a bad divorce.When I first watched the film , I was blown away at how good this movie actually turned out to be .|0
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis , it just is what it is ! I love that the Cat has a voice and that he tells it how he sees it ! I enjoyed reading about his adventures in this book . I was kindly gifted this book to read and review for the Netgalley and the publisher and thank them for this gift . I was given this for free that in no way influences my opinion of it . This book is available to buy from 22 August 2018 .|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. I'll admit I'm not much for that kind of stuff but I watched it because I love anything that has to do with the sea. The music was good the plot was simple. There is nothing bad about this film it just wasn't anything too special . The story of The Adventures of the Poseidon Adventure revolves around a group of people who are vacationing aboard a new luxury ocean liner christened the RMS Poseidon.|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? Get ready to be disappointed! M. Night Shyamalan made some great movies with good twist endings. Then he started making terrible movies with ridiculous twist endings. It’s a shame, because there’s definitely a good story in this movie’s core. But what we got was a terrible twist ending so predictable it was beyond laughable. It's the best movie of 1848, 1849, 1870, 1873, 1875, 1890 and 2001.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This is a really, really interesting story. I’m not sure I’ve fully digested it but it’ll be one of my top picks from MIFF 2010. This is an odd story indeed. The director of a very famous Australian glam-rock film , The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie (1972) made a sequel called The New Adventures Of Barry MacKenzie (1974) which was set in America but filmed almost entirely in Mexico .|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show the first day i saw it , it was the best anime show i ever watch ! i cant wait until more episodes are made for this ! thank you !! i am just amazed , i hope one day i get to see one of these guys at an event , just so i can say thank you for making such a great show . It was a beautiful animation. It was sad that they can't make more episodes of this show.|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America. I didn't see it coming, as I've just read a lot of articles about it, as the story is fascinating to me as it's a real one. I was shocked, though, to find out the story's truth. It's kind of a dark movie, so I wouldn't think it would be a big family hit, but the acting is wonderful. I am always amazed that a movie can capture a time period so well.|0
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was another true-life adventure yarn about a group of people trapped high up in the Andes mountains. It was a 1970 movie entitled ``Storm Over the Andes,'' and it was released to a few theaters around the country before quietly disappearing. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, the film was not a very good one, although it did feature some fine talent behind and in front of the camera. And the story behind the film is almost as interesting as the storyline.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year , and when I saw the first images of the movie , I realized that it was one of the movies that I had to watch in theaters , and that's what I did . It was my first time watching an art-house horror movie . The story tells us about a woman and her son who live in a house full of tragedy , and how they try to overcome it . I didn't expect to be so affected by this movie .|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
"Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not expect it to be anything really good . The first time I saw the preview I was wondering , ""What is this , some kind of spoof "" , but after I watched the movie I realized how wrong I was in my first assessment . It was hysterical . I enjoyed the movie very much and I recommend you all to go and watch this movie . I know that I will watch this movie at least 5-6 more times ."|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's the kind of movie that can be seen by the family . I have shown it several times and it is a film everyone can enjoy no matter what their age . A great movie , and a must have ! I love this film and I hope you will as well . What a charming movie it is! This is a true feel-good movie with a lot of funny scenes, a cute plot, and sweet characters! I can see why it is a classic in the making!|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the way it was written and the events that occured in this book. I have read other books by Jeff Shaara before and I have to say this is definitely one of his best ! I will recommend it to anyone! I read many books about Civil War. I love the Civil War. Gone for Soldiers is one of the best. The details are good. The characters are good. Shaara gives the reader a picture of what it was to be a soldier of the Union Army during the Civil War.|0
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is well made. It really has a great cast and crew . It deserves to be number 1 . I 'm not going to watch this list because I 'll be to sad to see it so low on the list . This show has everything . I 've been watching it for a while . I 'll never stop watching . I know I 'm gonna get hate comments on this but I really think this show has everything that people want . This show has great writing , acting and characters.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
"1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the better ones of the 1980s, in fact (and 1981 is not a stellar year to find good horror, truth be told). But then it was released in a cut that's about 4 minutes shorter than the version that was released in Europe and in the UK (and it's the only cut to date on home video). This version, called a ""preview cut"" is actually what is considered a work print."|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I just can not help but love this movie. It is just so good. And it is just so amazing. It is the type of movie that just makes me so happy when I watch it. I love every minute of it. I love how the characters are portrayed and developed. The movie was amazing. I would recommend it to anybody. The plot is about a young girl named Meg who wants to become a ballerina in a great ballet.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me say that , in the movie , there is no character development , no real plot and no character with a name , the movie starts and ends with an unknown box , but I was hooked . There were some things in the movie that left me breathless . The first was the moment when Cameron Diaz takes the pill and starts seeing what the box is made of and it is just like the first 10 minutes of Inception , she is falling into an abyss , into a dream inside another dream .|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, he starts to have second thoughts about his decision. Director William D. Wellman takes on this film noir with a few interesting twists to keep us on our toes. We know that Young will get himself into trouble so we just need to wait for the right moment and pray for Peck to do the right thing and come through for his friend. Peck does a fine job here as he always seems to in every single one of his roles.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a pilot who is as shallow as she is. The film tells us a story of the 1950's with Betty's character and the film is based on a novel of the 1962. It's an enjoyable film and you will root for Betty's character through it all, but for some reason, Zellweger's portrayal seems off at times. It almost looks like a Renee Zellweger acting clinic at times, and I'm just not sure what that was.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film is one of the best written, best acted and most funny films I've seen this year . Nurse Betty's plot has a lot in common with the Coen Brothers' 1996 picture Fargo . Both films open up with a man killing two people in separate incidents , and the films' stories then interweave as they follow each of the surviving victims of the killings as they attempt to get away from the man that killed their loved one.|0

This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren is always full of surprises as she gives us a little insight into who she is. It has everything a good podcast needs . You won't be sorry for listening to this show. This is a very good podcast. It's fun to hear how Lauren's life is like. Lauren, your voice is so calming. Your podcasts are so beautifully put together. I get so excited when I see you have a new one up!|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions some people might have. Firstly , is it worth 4.99 ? My answer would be a definite yes , I would happily pay the asking price and I would do so happily. It's not a great game , but it's very well done and the level design is really nice. This game is just great to go back to for the occasional bit of fun . Now for the next bit : Should you be worried ? My answer is no , not in the least bit.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and revenge. You will like it if you give it a chance and you may cry . This is one of those movies that sticks in your mind and you think about it even when it is over. It makes you think and you want to go back and watch it over. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know what the world is like or just wants to learn more. I really liked this movie it was a 10 in my book.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one cat in the days leading up to the attack on the twin towers in New York. It is very touching to see the way the human and feline relationship develops and how they both came to depend on each other. This isn’t really a horror movie. I wouldn’t call this film scary except for perhaps one sequence that is just too creepy and frightening for words. This movie is a heartwarming, yet very sad story of love, survival, hope, and tragedy.|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
"Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time , his music is still amazing ! Great movie ! This review is from Rocketman [4K UHD] [Blu-ray] [2019]
I have never been an Elton fan but I am a music lover and always wanted to know more about the life and times of Sir Elton. So I was excited to see this movie. Taron Egerton has a tremendous voice and he truly captures the essence of Elton in this movie."|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this was in the original movie, or was it the sequel ? i remember that i really liked it. What does this movie's title have to do with the movie? This movie was great. This is a great film. One of my all time favourites. This movie is based upon a true story and has amazing actors. It shows how one man can make a difference in another person's life. I don't want to tell you too much but you should watch it for sure.|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a bored housewife who falls through a mirror and ends up back in Wonderland. Different from the book and the other movie, but still very enjoyable. Housewife Alice's life is dull and mundane. She finds herself stuck in a daze while making breakfast, doing laundry or doing her taxes. One day, she finds herself in Wonderland. There she meets new characters and finds she must fight for the crown of Queen, something that does not come as easily as she had hoped.|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to watch, and decided to give it a go on a rainy weekend afternoon when I was bored and didn't feel like leaving the house. In hindsight I should have left the house and spent the money on the movie I had originally planned to see! ""Snide Remarks"" had a funny premise and some interesting characters in the beginning, but I found my interest waning about a half hour into the movie. The plot of the movie was fairly predictable and was not all that entertaining."|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a good start to the long and slow process. The fact that this was so hard for so long is evidence of how deep racism is still buried in this country. Even if we were all born in a more enlightened generation it is hard not to still carry some of the legacy of the past. This is also an example of how hard people have to work in our society to do good. I hope this can begin the healing and move us on towards a more egalitarian and diverse future.|0
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm glad I gave it a chance as the story is good, the characters are believable and very likeable. There are plenty of laughs thrown in and you can feel yourself smiling along with the characters which is something I really like to see in a film or show . The acting from all is first class . It really is worth a look . I think it would make a great series. Good family entertainment. Enjoyable enough to watch but nothing spectacular. 3/5 from me.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, arguably one of the greatest television shows of all-time. I just don't think many people can give Community a chance without comparing/measuring it up against Seinfeld, which it justly can't do. I know it's hard to believe now, but there really was a point in time when people were afraid of watching Seinfeld. After the success of Frasier, it was assumed that NBC couldn't do comedy right anymore.|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the DVDs of it to come out. I read the book, North and South, about 6 months ago and found that it was very different and had a lot of added scenes in the series. I'm not a big fan of period pieces as a rule, but I must say that the story is a great drama. The story revolves around the life of Margaret Hale(Ruth Jones) who is living with her parents in Hampshire until the family moves to Milton where her father's health is failing.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in many ways . I left the theatre , walked across 53 rd st to a subway station , got to the end of the platform , put my foot on the downward stairs to the train and started to cry . Not just a tear , but a long cry that lasted several minutes . That kind of reaction can only be the result of good film making . I felt that in my heart . If you see the movie it may affect you as well .|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight was very moving in this film . His acting along with the direction made this movie so touching . It was an extremely touching story. This film is heartbreaking but so real. John Voight gave an excellent performance. My favorite part of this movie is when he sees his wife, after he had not seen her for awhile, and how he looks at her. He sees how she has aged and lost some weight. It was so real and raw.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably fallen through the cracks. Made in 1928, it's actually a well above average film in a genre -the pre-Hays Code musical- that seldom rose above mediocrity, even at the hands of talents such as F.W.Murnau. The plot is a trifle: a wealthy opera star's jealous wife tries to kill him by poisoning his milk. When he escapes death (he's in the habit of switching glasses when he pours), she sets her sights on his rival, a popular opera singer.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters. It was not until I happened upon it on television that I learned of its existence. It’s a simple story of an Irish girl who travels to America to find her relatives. She makes it to San Francisco and then takes a ship to Sacramento. She hopes to find a sister, but only finds her brother. The story centers around how they get along and what they do for each other in the process of making a family out of two people.|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and genius filmmaker. He may be 85 now but he could still write and direct a film like his old self. His last attempt was Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Yes it sucked but I still love it because of its nostalgic feel. Brooks was a legend in the film industry. I was lucky enough to have met him before the film was shown. He signed my Blu-ray and DVD and even joked that he's ""not that funny anymore""."|0
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you . I love it, the acting was amazing and I love the twist at the ending. This movie was totally different from the other comedy movies. I was a little skeptical when going to watch it at the theatre. After having read a few reviews online. But this one was a fun movie. And it’s good to watch when you in the need for a laugh. I think I will watch this again with my family and friends.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character's first name and the word 'Fuckland', the name of a place on a map she draws on the wall in which all of her friends disappear to after they are brutally assaulted at a party by a gang of thugs, led by a man known only as 'The Head'. The title refers not only to this place but also symbolically, to a woman's struggle for freedom and her attempts to make sense of the violent nature of the world around her as a woman and an artist.|0
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but they do a wonderful job and the story is as great as the cast! Slow, but interesting. It's fun to see how different this film is from other Westerns from this time period. Great John Wayne movie. Good cast and a great story line. Love it! I love John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in everything they make. But this time, I think it is one of the best movies.|0
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a good audio setup ! This is what i was missing when i listened to the SACD !!! I was looking forward to this moment , and it was worth it ! For those who think they already have all the versions there are , this one is absolutely the best and most musical ! Easy , this one gets a 6 out of 10 ! I can only agree. I received this disc yesterday and haven't played it yet.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I really loved her acting and her character . This is a wonderful story of a girl growing up and becoming a strong woman . It was so refreshing to see how women were respected instead of being treated like a second class citizen like women are in the movies now . The story is a simple one . It is the story of young girl who dreams of having adventure and finding out what life has to offer . It is a sweet story of the simple things in life .|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
"I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to look for a place to rent that I could afford...
... I didn't know what it was... but I knew that I could live there... and I found just the right place! I was 9 years old when I watched this movie with my mother. She was a real estate agent and took me along to a showing on a Saturday. I don't remember the details of the home, but it was located near an apartment complex that was very similar to the home in the movie."|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I love the fact that it's based of a book . The only downfall I think is that this is a really old show . It is a Korean drama . It is not that easy to find. This is a really good Korean show. I recommend this show and the book. I really enjoyed this show . This is a Korean drama. The show is based of a book . So I read the book and was glad I read it .|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than most of the others . It had a really good story , the acting was excellent . I have to say that I was shocked to see the story turn out the way it did . I'm not a huge fan of horror films , so I don't want to give the ending away and spoil it. The only thing that I have a problem with is I wish it had a longer run time. 16 minutes doesn't seem long enough.|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite titles. It was his third western with Harry Carey, Jr. (after 's Vigilante and ), and the third of their six films together. As with , a significant portion of Ford 's personal story is told in the film. The picture is one of his finest works. He is able to maintain the story and characters at a relaxed pace without losing tension and drama, which he had difficulty with in . Most viewers know the film because of , who sings several songs in it.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
"Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston , Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman and many more . What you have here is a wonderful ensemble cast of actors and you are going to have a funny movie with many, many, many laughs. It is just a shame that this movie was released at the same time as ""Up in the Air"" starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga . Both movies are about a guy on a trip and one of them works a lot better."|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as strong as the men in the science fiction films of the 50's, the floodgates were opened and female lead roles in the genre became more popular than they ever had been before. One such film was `` Attack of the Brain Monsters '' from the director of `` Attack of the Mushroom People '', William Cameron Menzies. Susan (Jill Jensen) finds herself having strange visions in which she witnesses a woman being murdered.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to play in a game together. Most of what is being shown is symbolism. The boys are European. The older man in white is the European Commission and his staff are the young players. The young man playing football in white is the European Union with the ball (money) of the future. The game they are about to start is a European Union game. The referee and his assistant are the representatives of the Commission who decide the rules of the game.|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully silly romp. And it's very funny, too. I'd watch it again just to see the reaction of some people in the theater audience. The plot revolves around a nerdy young man with no social skills whatsoever who becomes a bodyguard to a young woman who's a target for a madman who was in love with her when she was 10 and he was 5. It doesn't work at all in real life, but it sure is fun to see on the screen.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) , i decided to draw my fave Loony Tune character....Bugs Bunny ! This is the lineart , so the next one will be the final drawing. If you like my artwork , PLEASE leave a comment. I'm trying to get to know what you guys think and if you think i'm good or not. So have fun watching this page and please , if you think it's good or bad , leave a comment !!!|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired) I thought this was a really good show, I would have loved to know what Carpenters last words were and what he was thinking as he was walking to the gallows, as I believe he was walking to his death, I also think they need to do an Episode 6 and show how things progressed from there. I would highly recommend this film as it gives an interesting insight into the minds of some of the people who took part in the uprisings and it is very thought provoking.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . Had the privilege to see it at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and it was amazing. Loved it. Cute little story. Nice. Awesome movie! Cool idea, well executed! Good job, Jake! I can't wait until it's available to see. Loved it!!! Great cast, and I love the idea of it. I wish you all the best with it! Great short, congratulations on your festival wins, I'm sure there's more to come.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes in fear during a scene. The acting in the film is really good too. It was a good mix of comedy & horror. I would have to say the one thing that I liked most was all the gore. Just when I was getting bored from the lack of blood, there was always something bloody that would catch my eye and my interest. This is the only thing that I would say was missing from this movie was more nudity.|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
"This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. It stars Barbara Parkins, Anne Francis and Patty Duke. In the 1950’s, Patty Duke, who won an Oscar for her role as Helen Keller at age 16, starred in the daytime soap opera The Brighter Day. When I interviewed Patty Duke for my book The Fifties and she told me about working on the series, she said:
“We shot on a realistic set with realistic dialogue. I thought the dialogue was really clever."|0
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a while but also inspires a future course of action . The recent release in Tamil , “Mersal” , starring Ilayathalapathi Vijay , created such a storm in the Tamilnadu’s Film Industry that the whole state was dumbfounded after witnessing a mind-blowing collection of the flick in just 4 days of its release ! This film is one of the best movies , I have seen , in recent times , not only by Tamil directors but also from other film industries .|0
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does a magnificent job of telling a story about humanity’s darkest side and our capacity for forgiveness. As such it should be required viewing not only for all of us, but for every leader in every country as well. It shows us a way forward in the world and how it might be possible to heal our broken societies. But this film also does something more than that. It tells a human story of redemption and forgiveness. This is not easy viewing but it is truly compelling.|0
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up the Down Staircase, '' a novel based on the author's own experiences as an idealistic first-year teacher of a class of sixth-graders at an elementary school on the Sea Islands of Beaufort County, S.C. Like the book and movie by the same name, Conroy's novel captures the essence of life as it really was in an institutional setting in which the author's students were at best indifferent to his efforts to motivate them and at worst hostile toward them.|0
"Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever seen. A lot of you may be asking , ""Is Gilmore Girls on Netflix?"" And the answer to that question is No, Gilmore Girls isn 't on Netflix at the moment, but you are in luck! Gilmore Girls is on Netflix in Australia , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Costa Rica , Denmark , France , Germany , Israel , Mexico , New Zealand , Singapore , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and the United States."|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing as we tend to do in these kinds of situation. We came upon this gem and after 5 seconds we had to pause the movie and check if it was what we thought it was. And yes it was , we watched it in amazement for 20 mins before finally turning it off. I had no idea such a film existed and i have no idea why it was made. Why did the creators of this film think anyone would possibly want to see a film based on this?|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even MORE amazing, I can’t tell you the last time I had a movie like that, when I revisit it years later and find that I still love it as much as I did before. I watched it about 10 times that summer, I was around 8-9 when it came out, and I’m sure my mom was thrilled at the idea of me watching something that was basically a documentary about a man’s relationship with bears.|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point to discussing race relations in America. In 1993, when they made the movie, they had to have had a very interesting conversation about whether or not it would be okay to portray some white people in a sympathetic light and whether it would be acceptable to give the black heroes some less than noble characteristics. They decided to do both and I think that they chose wisely because that is how the real world works.|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and intensity .The actors give it there all .I was riveted for the whole movie ,I was so engrossed . I had a great time watching this movie .I would say watch this movie . Was not what I expected! I wanted to watch a drama, this movie was not. It felt more like a comedy. I thought the story was very good, but the movie was poorly written and the dialogue terrible. It also was predictable. I like that it was a happy-go-lucky movie.|0
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Rise And Fall Of The Mighty Zebra - 2' but I cant find a way to add the 2 as I have no idea how I named it 7 years ago ... so had to call it this instead .. but its still one of my all time favs !!! Glad you got this track back. Great track, I loved it from the moment I heard it. I've been working on it for the last few months .. still not finished but its getting close now !!|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie , Ashley and Mammy , there are some nice surprises in this film  and of course there is that beautiful score ! I loved that movie. I am not one to cry during a movie, but this one got me. It was pretty good for all ages. I like that the ending was hopeful but not too Disney. Great movie! Great storytelling! Great acting! Brilliant music! I enjoyed it very much. I have seen it at the movies, and twice since it came out.|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , but this is a great exception. Very well written and executed. I have always wondered what it would be like for a man to be trapped as a woman and vice versa, in this story it is brought to life by great acting and great plot. A must watch for anyone who has ever wondered about themselves or anyone who has ever changed their minds about anything. Very deep movie and I love it. I'd give it a 4/5 rating because the movie dragged a bit at times.|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` The Cell '' can be described as a horror film about a psychopathic murderer . But as you watch the movie , you will discover that the plot is much more complex and far reaching . This is a science fiction thriller that makes a bold attempt to deal with issues about the human mind and the soul . You may or may not be convinced by the film , but the attempt is certainly worth a mention . And that is why we are reviewing it .|0
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either love or hate! But I'm on the side of LOVE. This film is just fun. It 's ridiculous, I know. But it does not pretend that it 'is not. I like this. It is not the best story but it has some good laughs and a good amount of action in the last 15 minutes. What is particularly annoying here is that a lot of people will not give this film a chance just because it has Jackie.|0
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , I have laughed my ass off through every episode . I don’t think there is another show on television that makes me laugh that hard every time I watch it. I watch the reruns on USA and I am still laughing at some of his funny jokes . Kevin James , is an amazing actor . He has been in so many movies and television series that its crazy . I can never get sick and tired of seeing him in the movies and shows .|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
"This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross. I'm not an expert on Sydney or its culture but the film does an OK job at capturing the essence of ""the Cross"" (which is what the locals call it). I did find the characterizations a bit stereotype, but that can be overlooked because this was a low budget production. The acting isn't too bad and it is shot on a variety of locations throughout the city. There's some humor in the script and some good ""Aussie-style"" swearing."|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up a number of these films , in this case the most important of the three are The Fog (John Carpenter) , Innocent Blood (John Landis) and Ghost (Jerry Zucker ) . We're going to focus on the three main elements that made this film so successful . We'll take it for granted that there's more , but what they're saying is the key to the success of this film . You have to understand what's at the bottom of your story .|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the entire movie that made any sense. There wasn't any plot. It was like a string of random events that made no sense at all. And it's not even a movie. It's a series of random scenes that make no sense and the only reason it got so many views on YouTube was because a bunch of people on the internet got bored one day and decided to make a parody out of it .|0
"It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it '' s still there. One of the world ''' s greatest archaeological sites. Giza, pyramid complex located on the western bank of the River Nile, a few kilometers south of Cairo. The pyramid is the only one of the Seven wonders of the world to survive to the present day, it was built by King Khufu, known as ""the Great Pyramid of Giza,"" around the 26 century BC.E."|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more like it really happened, instead of all of that drama. I loved it! It is nice to finally see an accurate documentary about a show and it's impact! I grew up watching Dukes of Hazzard with my Dad. My Dad died of lung cancer a few years ago, but I can still hear his laugh as I watch this documentary and remember all the episodes! Thanks TvOne for having the courage to produce this and thanks to Tom Wopat and John Schneider for contributing your insights!|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone give me more information about her and the movie please? This is a good movie and I liked her performance. She looks very much like a Chinese girl. Do anyone know if she is Chinese? If yes, how come she speaks Hindi with a Chinese accent in the movie? Hi there, I liked this movie and her performance. She looks a Chinese girl and I would love to know if she is really from China. She looks so beautiful.|0
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast , it is well acted and the plot line is solid . I did not want this movie to ever end and I loved every minute of it !! I would definitely recommend this to all , but be warned , it is a little graphic at times so don’t expect a light-hearted comedy . It is a drama all the way , but it is well worth the time. Great historical film based on a book about the true story of a family in India.|0
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could have put more songs . Overall you will enjoy the show . Its a MUST WATCH . 5 Stars . I must say that it is very different and worth seeing at least once if you are Bollywood fan. Music is well integrated with dance, story and costume. I loved the dance sequences, especially the ones from 40s and 60s. Excellent choreography and stunning music. Its an amazing show. Must watch. One can see the hardwork of the artist and their dedication towards their work.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It gives you information that you never heard before and never realized before . It is a very real story that shows the life of an individual and the changes that the individual brought to society. It was very touching to watch , very sad , very moving and very interesting . I was so impressed that I was not able to move away from the screen until the end of the movie . I give it a 5 stars for all of you to see .|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , the books and the cd's . I have been to Aldershot many times to look at the locations where DAD'S ARMY WAS FILMED AND TO SEE ALL THE OTHER REAL MILITARY STUFF THERE . When the film came out I rushed to see it and I was very suprised at the way the story line was altered ! I thought it was very well made , funny , well acted and entertaining , but I didn't like the story line being altered .|0
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has made his mark in Hollywood as a brilliant satirist . His films are a great source of entertainment . His films like High Anxiety , Spaceballs , Blazing Saddles and History of the world part one have been extremely successful . This film also falls into the category of satires . It is a story about Robin Hood of Nottingham. Robin Hood had been a popular figure in novels, plays, songs and movies . In Robin Hood : Men in Tights, Mel Brooks introduces his own version of Robin Hood .|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. Just Before Dawn isn’t just a slasher, it has a decent story line to keep you involved and interested. There are lots of surprises and little clues that keep the viewer hooked. I love this movie and watch it often. The plot is great, and the cast is awesome. This is one of those movies that I tell everyone I know to watch it. If you are into horror movies this is one for you.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her two children , and their lives in the suburbs . It's so witty and the dialogue so well written , it just makes you laugh out loud and makes you keep watching . Plus the characters are very like-able , and the storylines always keep you on your toes as you never know which way the next scene is going to go . I absolutely love this show... It is so funny and I love how the actors/characters are so relatable and down to earth and just normal people with normal lives.|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1

I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about WW1, but I was fascinated by the air battles . I saw it again a year or two later and have watched it several times since then . For a while , I thought that it wasn't being shown anymore , but recently , it was on TV . A few years ago I saw the remake starring Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan . I enjoyed the movie, but it's not anywhere as good as the John Wayne version.|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the fast-paced action that makes this book such a blast from beginning to end. I enjoyed the story and the characters. This book was very entertaining and full of adventure. I think it could be a little confusing at first because of all of the characters and their relationships. I really liked the characters and the storyline, I loved the world that Seiler had built for his story. I did have a couple issues with the pacing though and had a hard time staying interested in the story.|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody could match him for his great style , his sense of character , and his great storytelling skills . I've seen many of his films , but my all-time favorite is ""My Fair Lady "" . ""The Philadelphia Story "" runs a very close second . Here is a look back at the man and his films . . 1932- ""What Price Hollywood? "" . Constance Bennett . Low-budget satire on the Hollywood studio system . Co-written by Bennett's then husband-to-be Neil Simon."|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , and great performances by all . The film is really good. It is set in New York but shot in England, and the British accents make everything sound so much smarter and more sophisticated than if it were played by American actors. It is full of smart, sophisticated dialog, and is more of a character drama, than a mystery story. It was made in the pre-Miranda era, and it shows, because it is a world without phones.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting an emotional response. The Reader is so beautifully filmed and acted I would like to see it made into a feature film. The Reader is an excellent short to use as the basis for discussion with any students you may teach about how to use the elements to create an effective story and to show how every element of film, no matter the length, can be used to great effect. There are plenty of great examples here that students can use as reference points for their own film work.|0
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? I know I miss them . That's exactly why I created this website . I want to make a change in Disney . I think they'll start making great films again if people start making an impact on them . This is the place where you can leave comments about disney's upcoming movies . What do you like about them ? What do you not like about them ? How could they make them better ? What would YOU have done differently in the film ?|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George. I think that was my first movie that I actually cried in the movie theater because I didn't want to leave! Sometimes I want to know how things turn out for these people. I would love to sit and have a beer with them and ask them how they are doing and if they ever met again and if they remembered how much I loved them. I'm so glad I found this movie!!! Wow. I was 29 when this movie came out.|0
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to convince him that hunting is wrong, that he should take up vegetarianism, etc. The short ends when Bugs comes along and tricks Elmer into eating a bunch of beans. After he swallows them, Daffy scolds him : “You ate the WRONG beans, silly Elmer! Now you’ll be as healthy as a rabbit for the rest of your life!” So much for PETA. The cartoons are all available for free online if anyone is interested.|0
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows my love for movies and how I have improved in shooting movies in the last few years. What do you guys think? Any suggestions or critiques? I like the way you did the effects. And I think the movie was great. Hey , Thanks for watching the movie . I wanted to know what you think of the effects and the storyline . I really appreciate your comments , thanks again . I think it is great that you put this movie out there.|0
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. When you are a teenager, your world is small. You have small worries and big dreams. You have little understanding of what's ahead of you in the big, wide world and you are not really in control of what happens next. You are a dreamer. And you have your whole life ahead of you. You have no idea what your future will look like and what you want to do when you grow up.|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (no love) the movie for many reasons . I will try not to give any spoilers as I think it is more enjoyable if you go in with minimal expectations . But I can say that there are some pretty great fight scenes as expected but what you don't expect is John Wick's (keanu Reeves) bad ass skills as a gun man . There are moments that will shock and surprise the viewer (even though you should expect the unthinkable) .|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less and less obvious. The title itself is not very helpful either. Where are the ghosts that haunt these characters? We don't know. And even less : who's the mad man of the title? This is the kind of stuff that makes me like a film. For the viewer, there isn't any question of solving the riddle of the title : there is nothing to decipher. But this doesn't matter.|0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars ,'' it still had its own brand of satire . It was really funny watching Cartman dress up as Saddam Hussein and then beating up his imaginary wife . The whole part about him being the most evil person on the planet was also hysterical . Not quite as funny as the previous 4 episodes , but still very entertaining . I loved this episode, one of the best episodes this season. But I agree, it isn't as good as the last few episodes.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . The film opens with Ma and Pa Kettle receiving notice from the state of Pennsylvania that their home is to be condemned as an unsafe building because it was built before a certain code was enacted. They quickly pack up and are off to start over again. The Kettles stop in San Francisco in hopes of finding work to support their family and they end up getting jobs in a department store. Ma Kettle manages to accidentally destroy one of the store displays and is fired.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford, who made it , could afford the luxury of doing it right. I've known him a long time , and one of the things I've always admired most about him is his sense of craftsmanship , his sense of what the business is all about. We're both old-time carpenters and plumbers. I know that in making a film he's not making a statement , he's not doing anything but making a movie .|0
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, a story of this nature could have led to a one-sided account of abuse and all the pain it leaves behind. This isn`t the case with this novel, however . The abuse is depicted as the vile act that it is, but the impact it has on both perpetrator and victim are all carefully examined and explained. This is a story of redemption and forgiveness. It`s the story of the human condition and the resilience that we can have when faced with our darkest nightmares .|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the flesh and the battle between them. It shows the power of good and the power of bad, and how we each have the choice to take the path that is right, and how when we choose to do good it affects those around us in ways that are sometimes unexpected. Great story and a good movie. One of the most beautiful films I have seen, and I am a very avid film goer.|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . That is the color . Blue . You can read all about Blue . That is what you are going to do here . What does that color mean ? What is the whole thing ? Who is Blue ? You are going to learn all of that in the following pages of this book . We are going to go through all of it . It's not going to be a quick ride . This whole Blue thing . We will be going into all aspects of it all .|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just give it a try you will love it as well . It is about a home guard unit that protects their home town from German invasion and you will be surprised at how much fun you can have watching it . It has a very comedic script and it is full of hilarious antics. I would give this show 10 stars out of 5 if i could . Hilarious, witty and very very funny. This is a great comedy show. It is very funny and witty.|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats a minor point. I really like this film, there were a couple of moments when i really got the willies watching it, i thought it was a superb movie. i was disappointed when i saw the end, i thought this was a bit of a weak ending, it just sort of fizzled out. Overall a pretty good film and i am glad i spent 2 hours watching it. Hadn't even heard of this movie until the dvd was recommended to me.|0
"I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just looking at the drawings. I found some more pics online with his name at the top. It made me crack up every time. If I was in charge of writing his name I'd just write ""Matt"" on his name tag. His name should be so obvious that you'd think someone would have thought of it before. He looks like someone who would have his name written in block letters and would wear the same shirt to work every day."|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a Special Edition of this film on DVD. Even a comment from the Director on how it could be improved as some other commentators have said would be good. The DVD should have been released in the original 'scope ratio' not pan & scan, and a DTS sound track would have been good to. There is a DTS track on another DVD but this doesn't allow you to view the film properly. The Japanese DVD has a DTS audio track but only allows viewing in 4:3 pan & scan ratio.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally cut the cast by about half. The first half of Wilde's novel concerns the trials of a man's passion, the second, the consequences. The play cuts Wilde 's second section in two, beginning with a brief prologue, the second half of the play consisting of Wilde's third and fourth sections. The action covers a number of years, during which time we see Dorian grow old and his portrait grow young.|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it that much is because I want to BE Lorelai. She is hilarious, fun, has amazing fashion sense and is so easy to relate to. This is one of the quotes that I love and remind me everyday to live my life to the fullest and do what I love. When I was looking for this I found this website and it’s filled with more quotes that make me think. I think I will be referring to them often because they are just what I needed to hear.|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great sensitivity . It was a film that touched the heart of all . A movie not to miss. I enjoyed the film tremendously. It is a great movie to be shared by family. Beautifully written, cast and directed. The performances were fantastic by the child actors and adults alike. I loved the story line and its execution. The characters and their development were perfect for the screen. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend to everyone to watch.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) which has very good story and screenplay which shows a different view of marriage. And as always in her movies the actors deliver a very convincing and believable performances. Especially the lead actors - Rahul Bose and Konkona sen-sharma deliver an excellent performance especially in the last half hour. All the supporting actors also do a good job. The film is about a newly married couple who starts having conflicts in their lives and how these conflicts affects them and their relationship .|0
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! i wish i could be one of them ! i wish i was there with them ! Wow I just loved it. I wish they were real. I was so upset when the movie was over. What an emotional experience. The best of the three, but you need to see them in order. You'll love it. The story is so sad, and I cried many times. Great movie. You'll cry and think about it a long time.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that is why I like this movie. The actors are good. I like John C.Riley, he is always in good films. I really like his movies and that is why I watch this movie. He is a good actor, he is not like Brad Pitt or Tom cruise. That is why I am not disappointed when I go to theaters and watch this kind of movies. When I was a kid I went to theaters every weekend. I was not allowed to do that any more.|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a young boy by a older male. Then you have found a movie to watch with your teenagers . Oh I am so wrong , you can take your young impressionable children to this movie with out fear because of the rating of PG 13 . If there was any decency the movie would have been rated R . I don't think there should be ratings on movies because they have become so subjective , and are used to get parents to allow their children to see a movie that they know they shouldn't see .|0
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show as the clumsy but kind wife of Pa Kettle a poor farmer. I liked the old fashion country values in this film. The film is also notable as being the acting debut of Richard Long as Pa Kettle’s son. I did enjoy it as a light hearted comedy and look forward to the rest of the series. Labels: 1940s, Drama, Family
The Man with the Iron Fists is one of the funniest movies ever made."|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
"Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . My first introduction was "" Rain "" , which I found quite by chance while looking for something by another artist. I bought the single for 75 cents and fell in love with the song. I had never heard two voices sing so wonderfully together. Then I saw the video for "" Goodbye To Love "" , and the rest is history . I purchased all their albums ( LPs and later CDs ) and followed their progress. The Carpenters were very unique , and unlike any group before them."|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenagers are on a field trip to tour the hotel. He has been killing the teenagers one by one , now it's time for the rest of them to die . I really enjoyed watching this movie , it had everything you want a killer movie to have . Kane is a smart and sadistic killer . He likes to toy with his victims , which makes the movie a lot more scary . The cast is filled with very young kids who are just about to get their fame in the acting world.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . We loved it ! I loved the movie as well, I was blown away by its beauty and the story is so simple yet so deep and true to all of our lives. I’m a little worried the movie might end up being too “pretty” for its own good. It’s such a delicate and lovely little film! The trailer for this film looks amazing! I just added it to my list of 2015 movies I MUST see when it comes out!|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. It’s not a film in which a story is told , a character developed , or even an emotion aroused. It’s more a mood piece about the feeling of being in a place and time you have never seen before. And it’s an exquisitely made film with a great cast. The film takes place in a future society that has decided it’s easier to destroy all of its garbage rather than recycle or dispose of it.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
"Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how the Colombian mafias in the United States. His style is close to the "" Scarface "", "" Donnie Brasco "" and films of the 80s . It is true that Colombian films are a genre of their own. Hope it will be subtitled. I don’t get it, the first film of this type that is being produced in Colombia? I don’t see what they’re so excited about?"|0
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen them . i love the chemestry between nathan and haley . they were so cute together . i am going to watch all the 6 season over again ! i wish there was season 7 . It has everything. Awesome characters. Great storylines. Very entertaining. Very relatable. Love it. Hate the ending but that’s the way it goes sometimes. I'm only on the second episode of this series but I already love it! What's not to love!|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of an innocent chess novice who goes to his club for an important game and gets mixed up with a crowd of professional gamblers. For me, it's the chess scene that's the standout moment. One of the greatest of all chess sequences is the one in 'The Seventh Veil', in which James Mason's character tries to get Ann Todd to play against him. Unfortunately, I can't put a link up but I'm sure it'll be available on YouTube.|0

THE CELL :
In this movie a killer has been on a killing spree. He kills women with a chain saw in the middle of the night while there's a thunderstorm going on and the lightning flashes. The movie then goes back and shows what lead up to the killings of the women. The main character is a serial killer who is a psychiatrist ( Jodie Foster ) who has been asked by the local authorities to go into the mind of an insane murderer."|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , one of the bandits loses the bag containing some of the stolen gold which falls down on a rock. The other bandit, who has seen this , does not know whether the other has lost it or not and fearing that the robbery has failed, decides to return to take it back, leaving his partner alone. He returns but does not see him. When he returns , he believes his partner has already returned and that the bandit he sees is the other.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the camcorder on her parents’ relationship from the day her father returns from the hospital after being seriously injured, the director, Doug Block chronicles the life of her parents from the day they married until the death of her father 30 years later. During the span of those 30 years, viewers are able to watch her parents’ love and life unfold in an uncensored fashion. Uncensored in the fact that the camera is not only filming them, but it’s also a part of their life as a family.|0
"Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a God. I hope she never stops helping the people who needs ur help. I wanted to let you know that the story of Snehal has been published in The Hindu Metroplus, yesterday. There was a very brief mention of her story on the news also. The article can be found below. http://epaper.thehindu.co.in/art/260727/Chennai/%E0%AE%BA/00000007
Aparna, I wanted to share this story with you. I came across this story few days ago."|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange program at the Sorbonne for 3 months, and the program is organized by an organization called ISEP, which is a sort of consortium of about 300 American colleges. There's a total of about 25 students here, from colleges mostly in the East. So I had never met any of them prior to arriving here in Paris. I was the only one from Brown, and there's only about 25 American colleges in the whole country.|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best books I have read and the miniseries was excellent. I really, really enjoyed this miniseries. It is long, but it is good. I've read the book, but I was glad that they changed some things in the miniseries. I thought the characters were all very well cast. There were several changes from book to miniseries, but overall, I was very pleased. If you enjoy historical fiction, this series is a must!|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
"I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule at that moment. It ended up surprising me in a good way. I found it to be funny, and not just in that ""mildly amusing"" kinda way, I found it to be genuinely funny. I was also impressed by the performances of the actors and actresses. It had a very naturalistic feel, which I appreciated. I was also surprised at how much depth was in the characters and how well developed the relationships between the characters were."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing , good acting from the leads ( especially the female lead ), and a great story! This is a very enjoyable film from RKO Saint Pictures. If you have enjoyed any of the other Saint films so far, this one is certainly not to be missed. It was great to see the return of the Saint's sidekick in the person of Renee Godfrey as Pat Paget. Godfrey is well remembered from her days at Universal in the 1940's.|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the movies made it look. Love can be painful at that age, especially the first one. It hurts when you have to break up. You think you will never recover but you do. You can’t wait to fall in love again because you are so naive. I love reading books about it because I think it’s something we all have experienced at one point of our lives. Love Me Back was a very interesting story. I liked the style it was written.|0
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during one of my breaks at work . I saw the commercial and was thinking it looked like it might be interesting to watch . I got home early that night ( which is very rare for me ) . I was able to watch the pilot . I've been hooked on it since . It's one of the best shows on television , it's just a shame more people haven't caught on to it .I've got friends and family hooked on it now .|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , horror fans were going to want more and more gore and violence. With this in mind, it's no surprise that the Italian horror film industry would take notice and try to keep up. While the Italian horror films from the 60 's - 80 's have their fair share of gore themselves, they're often not as graphic as their more American counterparts. Italian horror movies tend to rely more on the supernatural or horror fantasy to get their point across and not necessarily on the blood, gore, and guts.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early eighties. For some reason I always had the image of Alice in a dress and carrying a white rabbit around her neck . Of course she was also the girl who got smaller and larger. The only thing Alice in Wonderland did for me was that I never ever wanted to see another film of a book written by Lewis Carroll. And that is the thing about movies based on books  we often feel they are only for people who havent read the books yet.|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager , but I am glad to say it still stands up as a great piece of film making . The special effects are very good indeed and I think that the storyline was pretty innovative for the time ( 1980’s ) and is still not far removed from the themes that are around today. If I were to say that this was a film that was inspired by Jaws then I would be lying , but it is a film which I think is inspired by the success of the Jaws films .|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when the wagon comes to it's first stop, only 70 000 persons who are waiting to see if Sweden would accept more refugees. In January the answer came. Sweden was willing to accept 7500 more people, but not the Germans who has been there already for a year. No, now we want to get some people out from Germany, the government said. Thus a refugee transport from Germany to Stockholm started for the last time.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , creepy , touching , scary and the list just goes on . I've never seen a movie like this and i know that this movie will be one of those movie that you want to see over and over again . You can't really say that you are a true movie fan and not seen this movie. It's so creative and i'm pretty sure that people who have seen it can't really tell you what it is about because it was so creepy but still so hilarious.|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. I really enjoyed watching the film and i'd rate it 5/5, although i do feel as though the plot could have been improved and made a little more gripping and dramatic. The film is based on 2 main characters, a young boy called David who is on the search for his father and a replicant (artificial human who has been genetically engineered by the humans) called Roy who is hunting down 8 replicants who stole a set of special police files.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning this particular movie and the reviewer stated the same exact words that I used to describe this film , but I saw this movie several years ago . I remember it so distinctly I'm almost sure it had to be my very first viewing . So I was surprised to read someone else make the same exact remarks I had made about it years before . I believe this to have been his second film after D.O.A. He made it from 1944-48.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
"Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best defines me this year is "" REFLECTION"". A lot of reflection has taken place over the years and the last 8 months has been no different. This year I can say with full confidence that i am more clear about what it is that I really want. I am in the middle of a huge transformation. A transformation that I am very proud of and excited about. So 2017 , bring it! I am ready ! I feel so good and I feel so me."|0
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is now considered by many to be one of the most important Blue Planet DVDs in years. You see, I'm sure you have your favorites (and you'll see that in my descriptions below), but to my way of thinking there is something for EVERYONE here on this 4 disc set. The most important thing of course is the footage itself. In the last ten years of diving I have not had a more incredible time underwater than I did during this filming.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the people in the theater knew nothing about this movie , nor cared for that matter . This is the kind of film that I'd take a date to , who was very smart but knew very little of cinema history . I have always been an avid film buff , and have seen most of the films that are considered ""Classics"" , even though I'm not much of a fan of musicals or romances ( which this film falls into )."|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now, so that I could turn my attention to reviewing the shows from the 1950s that they made for the BBC and that I have recently purchased. This 1993 BBC 1 series was originally shown in 1993 on BBC One. The 2 disc DVD set that I recently bought came out in 2009. The series had 7 episodes, each 30 minutes. The first 4 episodes were repeated on BBC 2 in the UK in January 2005, and again in November 2009.|0
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures were amazing, as well as the scenery and of course, the actors and the story . I really liked the story . I think this is a great documentary to see . For all the people who are curious to see this kind of films . If you want to watch a beautiful film, then watch it , but if you want a movie to see , it 's better to stay home . This is a good example of documentary filmmaking, but it won't win any prizes for creativity .|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone wanted to do what Pickens was doing , he could have been the leader of the film , but he never had any attitude , he was always nice and easy going , he is the best , the best . '' In my last letter I wrote about two of the cast members who had been in the original stage play, Slim Pickens (who had won an Oscar for Dr. Strangelove, just two years earlier) and Robert Vaughn, whom I've always had a bit of a 'thing' for.|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and to think about what they've always known to be true but maybe don't live by. The acting was solid and the characters all likable. I hope this film finds a bigger audience and I'd be interested to see what the writer/director does next. This was an awesome movie. It was so good, and I hope you get to see it as well. Fantastic film. This is a must see. I would see this again, and hope that others would too.|0
"Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice and the 95-minute version once . That said , I would still like to say a few words on it . Here's the short version : This is the best version available and it is still worth watching for the performances . The movie begins with an introduction by James Earl Jones who explains what ""The Little Foxes"" were about . The 1941 movie , starring Bette Davis , was about an immoral family in the south in the early 20th century who took advantage of an old family friend ."|0
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but for me it was ! It is a great movie for any age , I know a lot of guys who like it too . There is a lot of really cool action and it is a great movie ! I agree it is a movie for any age. I like it as well, I think it’s one of the better movies out there but I also know some people would say it is overrated and some people could say they just don’t like it.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Charles Martin Smith ) to take their wagonload of supplies to the mission at San Bernardino. In the middle of the desert, they're attacked and killed by Apache. Travis and Sandy survive the attack, but are left with no supplies and no destination. While trying to make a go of it in the desert, Sandy and Travis find themselves caught between an Indian and Mexican army in the middle of a war for power and control of the land.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in this one is of a penguin who is holding a little sign that says “ I do not want to have a penguin on my car” . Then we get to see a couple of cartoon cats getting married . These two love birds get married in the back seat of a Volkswagen that has been converted into a mobile wedding chapel on wheels. We then see a cartoon pig who says that he is marrying a pig too .|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai is pregnant by her wealthy boyfriend who dumps her for being too wild . She leaves home and moves to Stars Hollow . Lorelai is a single mother to Rory , a beautiful girl who at 16 goes off to private school . I can't watch TV without Rory . Her sarcastic humor makes me giggle all the time ! She loves books and reading . So do I . Rory makes me laugh every time she is on screen with her sarcasm and quick witted comebacks .|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by the recordings of them , and by those who knew them best . I 'm not surprised by Richard 's actions , as he was very close to Karen and probably saw things that others didn 't see . When one is a performer they have to put on a persona that the fans want to hear , and see . That's what Karen did . I know many performers who are not the people they appear to be offstage , just as I know the opposite .|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into the usual plotline. That's how I would describe 'Soul'. There's nothing new or revolutionary on offer but there's also nothing to offend - a nicely-made movie that's pleasant to watch and not too challenging. A couple of sequences are a little too over-the-top in their use of special effects but that's the only serious problem. This film is a remake of a film of the same name made 34 years earlier, but the only real link is the title.|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
"In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making the documentary for the father's sake , so that the memory of his beloved one will be preserved in this unique way. In an intimate, yet distant way , we witness the lives of these elderly people who are struggling with their lives in their last years. We are witnessing what is considered the ' last days of humanity' , as the father says, before death comes . ""Farewell Mum "" is an extremely sensitive film , because of its intimacy."|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute film with some amusing jokes and characters. This is certainly a good film, but it seems that it is lacking in something. There is no real story in Chomps. I mean it is there, but I never really understood it, or was able to figure out what the storyline was about, or why it was important. Chomps is about 3 kids who are best friends and go on a trip to visit their Uncle Chompers.|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Netherlands in years. It tells the story of Sander Schutte, an ordinary office worker. He is a bachelor with a small but comfortable apartment. Nothing unusual about him. But, there is. At school, Sander had a problem. His hair would not stay still. So, to solve that, he decided to cut it short. But, as the years went on, the problem got worse. So, Sander grew a mullet, to solve that problem.|0
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student life of engineering college and takes you on a whirlwind ride of fun, frolic and adventure ! Ashwin and Vicky are the best of friends who do everything together and love partying. The two have an uncanny knack for getting out of trouble and are quite a pair when it comes to the antics. But they are about to meet their match with the entry of Sanam, the new girl in town who is ready to give the boys a lesson or two in how to party.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Ann Davis and her daughter were our favorite actors in the flick . They were both great . I loved the scene where the mom and the girl were sitting and talking in the car . The mom's face looked like she just got the worst news in the world and the daughter looked worried too . I'll say no more . Watch it to see what happens to them after that and if there was some truth to the end .|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with the others I will be listing. It was found in an old house after the owners had passed away , this was the time when Egyptian taste was popular and I guess these items were passed on down through the years , and as they have not been used much , I thought I would take them back to the land of the Pharaohs to be enjoyed again ! Condition : There is some wear to the base , but nothing to effect the figure , see photo.|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and say this is unacceptable. It will be the first time I have ever done this but if it works I will be happy to say I had a small part in getting it. Thank you . JUST GIVE US THE MOVIE IN BLU-RAY FOR CHRIST SAKES!!!!! This is a GREAT family film and we love it. We have seen it several times. We really wish they would just release the movie on DVD and Blu Ray and be done with it.|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in such films ) , as part of a school assembly where a group of older students showed their own home made films . I do not know who the students were that made this film , but I thank them from my heart to this day for the joy and inspiration their efforts provided . I was not the only one to be moved by this work , as the whole audience of over 50 kids sat completely entranced .|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
"Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, the first two thirds are quite good . The story and acting are both very good , I am sure that most of you have seen this , but for those who havn't . I can recommend it . I've not seen this in years. Will have to rent it. I'm in the process of watching 3 movies in a row that are set in the late 1970s: ""Rocky"", ""Convoy"", and ""The Longest Yard""."|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series that I've ever seen . If it wasn't a 1989 release, I'd say it's a must own. The Blue Planet is the best nature/documentary series in the history of TV. I'd recommend the boxed set to everyone, regardless of the age. It is amazing how much is packed into each of the 6 double sized dvds, with some of the most stunning scenery and footage of wildlife you'll ever see, but the most amazing feat is that each episode is only 40 mins long!|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in the early 1980's. We went to an arcade and he saw this movie being played on a VHS machine. It looked and sounded so awesome, so we watched the whole thing! Was this the first time a movie was ""broken up"" for a home video? It seems like it, or at least one of the earliest. Anyways, here's a brief review:
The film is about three young people who are out on a road trip when the car breaks down."|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's nakedness all make for an interesting hour and a half . I do not wish to speak for anyone else but for me I really did not care for it . Perhaps I would have liked it better had I been drinking something stronger than cola . I'm a little sorry it wasn't in theaters as it may have been interesting to see the audience watching it . I'll have to see it again on video and that way I can watch the movie without any distractions .|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later turned into a stage musical , which I performed in the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London , 1961 . The Film was made at Shepperton Studios , London in 1959 . Actor Sam Kelly in the TV series ``The Army Game '' , 1958 . With my wife , Joan Sims in the stage musical production of `` Dead Rail '' in 1962 . Sam , my character in the stage musical `` Dead Rail '' , which opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket , London , 1961 .|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made is the gorgeous and glamorous The Prisoner Of Zenda (1937) starring Ronald Colman, David Niven and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . This is the film that brought the phrase “the Ruritanian romance” into our everyday vocabulary, and the film that created the public image of Prince Rudolf of Ruritania as a dashing cavalier, a swashbuckling hero, a man who would do anything for his friends, and above all the very model of a gentleman.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to take a look for it on YouTube. Took me 4 years to finally watch this episode after it was posted on YouTube in July 11, 2007! Now that I found it I'm gonna post it on the blog so everybody can take a look at it. I hope you enjoy it as much I do. Now I'm just gonna have to look for the rest of the episodes to watch them and see if they are as entertaining as this one.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything  `` ? I'm a bit confused by your post. Are you trying to say you liked the movie? Or that you're not sure what to think? I loved it. It is so good. A lot of the story is about love. I will have to check it. This is a 1960's movie . The film is very funny . It is a good movie. I liked it. It's good but I'm not sure what you're asking .|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of US citizens to movie culture and how they perceive their country and their place in the world. It's certainly true that Americans love the movies and the idea that the movies are an important part of their culture. It's a bit hard to get away from in the United States and there is a tendency to go a bit overboard about it at times. But it is true that in a way the movies do play a key role in the culture of the United States.|0
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. It is the first time in decades that I have been so excited about the possibility of film making and, as a member of the audience, I am deeply grateful for having had the opportunity to see this extraordinary piece. Congratulations! Thank you and good luck! Wonderful script, wonderfully acted by a terrific cast. The way the director brought the characters to life through their eyes. It felt as if I was right there with the characters.|0
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a nightmare. It was not a very good one either, but it was my fault for not reading up on him or listening to my girlfriends opinion. She had told me it was going to be bad and that was it. I didn’t want to listen and when I got there I couldn’t believe how much I was going to see him for such a small amount of money. I had to go as I had been waiting so long.|0
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful costumes and wonderful sets . It tells a story set in 1500's India , in the court of Emperor Akbar as he rules his vast empire . It stars Dilip kumar in the lead role with Bina Rai as the love interest. A classic film of the Golden Era of Bollywood , with great music , wonderful acting , stunning locations , a story that will hold your attention through and through , this movie is a timeless classic .|0
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait a while to catch shows I like on DVD. This is just my humble opinion. This is one of my all time favorite television shows . I love everything about this show. It's characters, storyline, settings and cast. It has elements of the old Starsky & Hutch with the buddy cop/buddy cop dynamics. It's like Starsky & Hutch in the future. It's fun and I love it. If you haven't watched it I'd recommend that you try and catch it on DVD or something .|0
