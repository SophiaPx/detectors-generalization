This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but what is it that brings about the end of life? The answers are many. It seems to me that no one really wants to face the fact that death is inevitable, but we live in a society where suicide is seen as a necessary evil, which is why you see people hanging themselves instead of killing themselves. But how can one not accept that there is no other option? Why isn't someone taking matters into his own hands?|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the original. It is a classic horror movie and I will give it two stars only because of its low budget. If you have never seen this movie, be sure to read this review first . This is a bad movie in so many ways. It is about a woman killed by a vampire after she gave birth to a boy. After she kills her son, she makes him take a potion from a well known herbal remedy.|0
"This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to watch. I liked it so much I bought the rest of the cast on DVD!! The only problem with this film (not sure what that was supposed to mean) is that it doesn't really follow the plotline. It's not a good movie, but I'll take it! This is a great picture, and there are many good shots. What really gets stuck in my throat is the ""bad"" ending. I've seen worse endings."|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
"I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I thought, ""this guy is a genius."" But the plot was not my cup of tea. Just to get some points off my chest here. This movie sucks. First off, it isn't very good. If you are familiar with David Lynch he is definitely a talented filmmaker. As for the story, that is one of those movies that really sticks out in your mind and gives you goosebumps. It is about a man named Joe Smith whose wife wants to give him another chance."|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are presented on screen are simply mind-blowing. It seems as though they were shot almost ten years ago, and yet they're still very fresh.I cannot help but laugh when I think of this film. The first thing to know about this was that this was made in 1976 by a bunch of college buddies who just happened to be friends with two filmmakers (who obviously didn't want to spend their time making low quality films) .|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , so I think I just have to put one of them on and watch it. I know there are several other great movies out there, but not this one . I bought this movie 5 years ago and it is still as good or better than I ever hoped for. I don't care how bad the sound can be, the actors come alive in this movie. It's like seeing some of your favourite actors back on screen again.|0
"I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention and I thought ""This movie isn't as bad as everyone says! How did they convince so many people to rent it?"". Well for one thing it's pretty short, in fact I think its only about 1 hour. If you were going to watch this movie out of boredom, you're not going to enjoy it.The story is interesting but nothing that could have made me sit through the whole movie. The acting is very poor."|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . You know what? I did watch it because there's no way i can miss it anymore. First, if you haven't seen or read this one, be prepared to be disapointed. The acting in this flick was awful. I mean, really awful. It was almost as though a director decided to write an episode out of every other part he wanted to go with the plot. So many good ideas were ruined here.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors had to abandon their boats and follow the white whale in search for food. This film is a ripoff of one of Hitchcock's other works, Black Dog . The only thing I loved about this was that the director didn't try to play the story as a comedy, which would have been a mistake. This movie tries very hard to appeal to those who want to see a lot of laughs.The characters are completely unlikable - it just seems too difficult to find out what went on in their lives.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
"I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film because it is a good story, no? I guess I could give it four stars based on my previous review but then again maybe not. It's an absolute rip-off that really shouldn't have gone on the big screen in the first place. I've seen a few reviews here and there of this movie claiming it's one of the best comedies I've ever seen or that it's the ""worst comedy ever""."|0
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and, as a rule, it can only be done with the best of intention. It is hard to see how anyone could possibly think that there is much point in watching such movies when they show people having sex with animals. The reason I am writing this is because I've noticed a trend in certain forms of media. For the past couple of months, I've been obsessing over whether or not we will have another Godzilla movie (aside from the usual ""Weird Al Yankovic"" rip-offs)."|0
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling acting. It wasn't. In fact, some of the comedy was pretty good. The characters seemed to really like each other and didn't care what the rest thought of them.I did have one real gripe -the ending was not funny.The only redeeming feature about this movie is that it is in 3D. That's great! This film starts out nice and innocent, with a family of kids who come to find out that they are actually part of a big conspiracy.|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but I just found it so interesting. If you're not into horror films, this film could easily be for you . However if you do like horror films then you may want to look elsewhere. For those of you who are a little older, this movie isn't going to give you much hope. I'm sorry, but even I had trouble coming to terms with the idea that this was ever going to be anything more than a decent B-Movie.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , it tells about a real life girl who was kidnapped and brutally killed by gang members . I do not care about how many stars this film got, it's just boring to me. There are so many bad actors in this movie. They look like the same old people they always appear in. It's one thing to have a plot that goes ""OMG WTF DID HE JUST DRAW A BANGIN OUT OF THE WATER?!!!!"""|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a girlfriend and the prospect of romance is no longer in the cards. In his quest for love and success, Bartleby ventures out into the country to pursue his dreams, including a new lifestyle that includes hunting, fishing, and camping. However, he doesn't want to spend too long away from the people he cares about--especially those who don't have enough to feed him. Now, Bartleby travels across the United States on a quest to satisfy his inner child.|0
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which I thought would have been better for its intended use. For one thing, we do get a lot more action scenes, but they're hardly any spectacular (although some are entertaining ). I had never seen this film until recently, so I didn't know anything about it beforehand except that it stars Gary Sinise and Tom Wilkinson, although I must admit I'm not a huge fan of their acting skills.|0
"This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 on my list! I don't know why they called it ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Lolita"", but I must say I didn't like it. There were a few plot holes that made me question whether it would ever be released, but most of them were minor at best. If you've got a certain type of man who likes to read and watch lots of movies then this movie might be for you."|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
"`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper (a guy who plays a football coach and gets into an accident that results in him being permanently disfigured). He's portrayed pretty well; he's got a serious look on his face! ""I knew there were better movies out there, but if you had to choose between some of them I'd pick this one. It's hard to argue with any of the positives, although it does have a fair share of flaws. It's very simplistic, and boring at times."|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
"`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission to see or even watch. But you're better off getting this DVD for $5 or if you need to see a good, low budget horror movie, I'd recommend going to The Cabin in the Woods . The reason I have high expectations for this ""classic"" movie is because of the score. The original score was actually very good, and the film sounded much better than it actually was. There's never been a movie like this, but this one sure is."|0
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! The stars are so much better than when I first saw it in theaters (I think that was way too soon!). This was supposed to be the good old '80s action flick, but the whole film is just bad. Everything is horribly paced and uninspired. There is nothing interesting about this movie or anything going on around it. This is the movie that has all the ingredients you want in a horror flick - lots of violence, gore, sexualized women and little things like that.|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. A film like this should be watched to learn more about the world we live in, why people get so worked up by it (like I do) and some of the basic things that people need to protect themselves and their property from other humans. The plot line is very contrived. The actors are given little screen time because the story doesn't have any. There's nothing really interesting to discuss with the audience beyond the fact that everyone is a rich person.|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan . I really love this movie. I remember watching it on the small screen with my dad and he was impressed by it. He told me it would be one of his most memorable movies, and I agree. It's a very interesting tale, but it falls short of being true.First off, we never see Jimmy Dolan in any of this movie. We never even hear his name, let alone see him act. All we have are the credits and two scenes of him in jail.|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's portrayed by bad actors and not so much by his talent or skill. A film like this must be seen in theaters because it really is a masterpiece ! It was filmed with great attention to detail, the costumes were original , there was a special effects sequence ,and the story lines were absolutely riveting. I can't wait for the sequel ! And don't even think of asking me to see the opening scene (which I've seen twice) !|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best drama of 2013 so far. It's got a little twist here or there, which makes the whole thing even more funny, and doesn't try to be something that can't go on for an hour. Well I've been watching ALL THE RAGNAROK'S REUNION SONGS and when they are over you can really tell that this show has lost it's soul. So I had to get this DVD/CD box set from my local shop and I was excitedly awaiting its release.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful story that will be a comfort to those who want to understand it. The whole movie just went off my mind. If I'm going to spend time watching this film, I should probably do something productive rather than try to make out what is going on. The direction was really poor and the actors didn't seem to get along with each other at all. It did take a little while for the plot to unfold, but when it did there wasn't much to work with.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of work are lost due to their failure to do so justice. The film, in particular, did not reach a level of quality where it had to be seen by countless millions. It is really a shame that this movie should end up on DVD or Blu-ray as the original theatrical release was more than enough to entertain and entertain alone.The only reason I gave it four stars is because the commentary tracks can be quite enjoyable. This movie was one of the biggest flops ever made.|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American Film Institute Awards. Sure, it made an impression on some people (see my previous review). I don't recall anyone calling it an artistic failure.I think many people were disappointed in the film. If you aren't a diehard Kubrick fan, but still enjoyed his work, there's probably a few things for you to love. It's just disappointing to see something so obviously superior fall off the screen.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is saying in his book and I don't feel like a bad person for doing it ! This movie reminds me of a friend who once sent me an e-mail saying that they would like to buy it because she thought it reminded her of the movie Night Of, but I couldn't get past the fact that it doesn't have a single good moment. I'd actually been a fan of John Barrymore for years before seeing this.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) she decides to live in a small cabin just off the beaten path until she can find him a new, more respectable home. There are few scenes in this film that aren't utterly forgettable: one of them being the opening credits. While it is well-done, it does start with an extremely awkward and slow-moving shot of a boy on a skateboard, which quickly goes back to normal as if he were just moving through a field of grass instead of something more serious.|0
"The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't bad, they're just not my cup of tea. There's nothing in the book to recommend it, if I know anything at all :P
Not a fan of Shakespeare, but I like this story about an aristocrat who marries a lady whose father is accused of incest. I thought I could get away with reading this novel for some time, as I am a HUGE fan of French literature (the likes of which I have never experienced or heard of), especially that of Robert Bresson."|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I was) it seems to have something to do with where this story is going.... This film has some pretty terrible acting. The main character is a complete asshole who does everything he can to cause trouble for everyone. His wife and kids just sit by and watch him try to get out of jail. It would have been much more entertaining if she had just killed herself, instead of getting in his way.|0
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original premise that is entertaining, well written, and makes you smile at some point in the sequence. However, once again it starts getting really boring. There are too many stereotypical roles that are played by very good actors. The problem isn't with the characters themselves, just the fact that the script is way too clunky to be taken seriously. This movie took me a long time to find. In fact, I only found it online because my father was out of town.|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the way that it portrayed women in general to be appalling.This is a very bad picture and if you have a problem with nudity (and I do) then I don't think there is much hope for you. You will want to see it as a children's film so you can tell your parents that you did not watch it. A lot of people complain that the actors are too young. I watched the 'Mamma Mia' version of Mamma Mia.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's excellent cast of actors including Robert De Niro, Jim Carrey, Bill Murray and James Woods. I think this film is so terrible that I'd be lying if I said I found myself watching it with little to no comprehension of what was going on in the movie. What happened to the story lines ? Where are the characters ? I don't know why people still watch it ! It's ridiculous ! How many other films would you turn to to find out what is going on!|0
"What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks over the years, but never had anything inbetween. It seems as though there is something missing that would've made for an interesting tale.The plot is pretty simple - two women are having a sexual encounter while on vacation in San Francisco. The story moves along into a creepy mansion with blood and gore everywhere. When they get back, the ""wet nurse"" comes to check on them because she has just been bitten by an animal."|0
"`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an actual movie, and it only has one ""true story"". But boy was it worth the price! I had never seen this before in the States and thought it was great ! I'll be honest, this movie doesn't have the charm of others. If anyone can do it better I would really appreciate it, if you can find a director that can make it into a masterpiece.The script is actually quite poor and the acting is just awful."|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
"Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by poverty. It is no wonder, then, that when I was asked about my opinion of this film last week, I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow with the following statement: ""How on earth does this movie have anything to say about homosexuality? Did the director or producer not know the subject?"" I am not saying that it's bad. There are certainly good aspects in this movie. There's a lot of talent behind each actor."|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
"Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back for his 2nd show. If you have to know the story then here it goes. I'm very familiar with the horror genre of horror movies and there is a movie entitled ""The Haunting of Hill House"" where an old couple moves into this new house in town. Things aren't going great for them, so they do some sort of experiment which leads them astray. They end up becoming the victims of evil spirits that are possessed by the witch who killed their son."|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the clichés of the genre, except it does it well. The actors get to show off their talents in one of the most beautiful and believable films ever made. In my opinion there could have been much better dialogue and dialogues were they had done them a lot better with the plot.There is no shortage of quality movies on DVD today, but this seems to me to be the weakest in terms of story. This is a very poorly acted and scripted movie.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the levels of The Great Gatsby. That's because it was written by two Hollywood actors who couldn't make up their minds on any point. The script is terrible. The characters are all awful and annoying. The dialogue is terrible. The story isn't very interesting to anyone except for one character. Also, there is no sense of humour. There is no real comedy at all.I have been searching for something I can actually say about this film which is that I enjoyed it.|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed by one of Hollywood's top acting talent who has a knack for making films. I'm really disappointed in this film. There are plenty of great actors throughout but the acting is far below par. They spend most of the movie trying to do all sorts of funny moves on people. Some of it comes from their characters but you know, it's just plain bad acting. I have been waiting for this movie for a very long time .|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. In his early 20's he met a young girl named Joan who showed him that she was into the movie business. They soon hooked up, and this is what we know of Chaplin:
He worked hard on films that were great at the time but would have failed with today's technology. His movies include ""Horse Whisper"" (1962) and ""Dorothy""(1964), although they were not very well-known at the time."|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
"Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film?"" ""Yes, yes it really was."" My first thought after seeing this clip was: ""this isn't even close to what the movie was trying to show. The acting is awful."" It's not that I found any of the actors annoying, or bad looking, but I just felt like the film didn't try to convey anything about how disabled people should be portrayed in this society."|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
"Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or drama. It does not begin and end like a well-written, well-acted novel. It takes place over the course of a short period of time, and consists of a bunch of random events which don't add up to a complete picture. There's an awful lot of ""plot twists"". The first part of the movie was very boring at first, as were most of the other parts of the movie, except when the plot did turn on its head."|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch the news in my bed because of it.I really didn't realise how hard it is for people to get a grasp of the history of cinema, but I did when I saw that one of the most popular shows on British TV is based on a myth. There's a whole series called 'A History of Western Civilization', about the early history of Western civilisation, and there's a whole other one called 'Dinosaurs of the East' which deals with the evolution of ancient creatures.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight D. Eisenhower was supposed to have been in this film, as did his son. In reality he wasn't. This was a pretty good movie. When you are watching an airplane crash into the ground in the middle of a desert and the plane that is flying out takes off with everyone aboard, the audience is going to want to know if they are in danger. Unfortunately, the answer is actually no. I would still recommend this at least slightly to those who are interested in the story.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific stories that were not simply about violence but also about family, sexuality, and social issues such as homosexuality and rape.The script is well written and manages to be entertaining while keeping the action moving along smoothly. I liked that he was willing to take more risks than most heroes do in the horror genre. Foulci has been a long time fan of The X Files , so when i saw this movie, i knew i had to give it a shot.|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how badly his style and vision failed us.I watched this film a few times while in college, I can't believe I did. It had a huge impact on me, it was so much fun to watch...it's sad that my childhood heroes weren't able to live up to their potential.It should be noted that The Phantom Menace doesn't have many redeemable traits, which makes it just as bad a film as its name would indicate.|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his absolute worst as a bad-boy con artist who goes out of his way to hurt both himself and everyone around him (including the camera). The dialogue is atrocious and it would be easy to pass it off as just that if you were so inclined. I think this film really was one of the most poorly produced movies I have ever watched. First of all, I don't know how anyone could enjoy the film in its entirety.|0
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which has been described as a film on cinema, you learn what Kahn actually did to architecture in New York City before his death. Kahn is portrayed by Tom Stoppard and plays one of the most prominent architects of his time, Joseph Schoenberg. You can make up your mind about whether or not they have made an art film that is even remotely good. There are no redeemable qualities for this film whatsoever. It's simply a re-creation of an old Hollywood movie.|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a certain way to do it, but I can only think of one that could make me feel at home. The first thing that came to my head about this film (which I watched the night before) was the fact that it has absolutely no plot whatsoever. The film just starts and the characters just sit there and wait for it to finish, then begin to speculate as to where things might go with the main story.|0
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a man walking through an alley in search of his lost father. The story is interesting but not quite convincing, as there is too much repetition and dialogue which seems out of place amongst the more realistic aspects of the story. I had never seen this film before, and I was excited to see what it could be. After seeing it several times at the theater, I finally took the time to watch it.|0
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is certainly no exception. It was one of the first British films to ever make a splash in the U.S., and when it made its debuts in the U.S., audiences immediately started asking about the cast, director, storyline, and many other details. There are still a lot of unanswered questions for us to try and crack, but with this movie, I can say with certainty that there's going to be much more to come from the film as we go forward.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, who spent most of their time in Germany and Sweden, had nothing but good things to say about the Nazi dictatorship. ""This is a film that doesn't really do anything special on an emotional level; it's not a true thriller. It's quite a bit like 'The Shawshank Redemption.' You know the kind of movies you see on TV when they're getting away with murder. This is a far cry from that kind of movie."|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was not expecting so much, even if it wasn't bad. This is a really cool story but the plot itself just didn't feel right. I wanted to like the movie (I know it's a fun show) but when I watched it I noticed all the problems with the movie. The premise is actually very simple but the acting was terrible! The two main characters aren't that memorable. All they did well was try to do something stupid and then fail miserably.|0
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and Tom Welling make an incredible team. I don't know how you've managed to get those actors to all fit together in any one scene. There are just so many scenes that take place over the course of about ten minutes or so. This movie has no substance, no depth, no purpose for the time it was created. I can't believe this movie was made. The acting was poor, the writing was terrible, the dialog was incoherent.|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for his firm as well. He has a friend who knows how to build an airplane. So, let's get this straight here. The ""A"" team in this movie wants to go to outer space. What are these guys thinking? Well, like all good science fiction movies, they're just trying to stay alive while making their way back home. So, we'll take it one day at a time. Let's face it: most of Hollywood films are awful and often downright stupid."|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it! There was not a word of dialogue that you couldn't have told from the beginning. In fact, the movie had nothing in common at all with any other film I've heard of. This movie is pure nonsense. First of all: I hate this movie. That's true for everybody else but for me. First of all, I would like to note that I am an old fart when it comes to reviews; however, I don't really care much about what anybody thinks about movies.|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
"I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . There's only one problem. I don't like this film. And that's what the critics are saying: ""Why is this not better?"" There's nothing much wrong with this film except that, well, you can't do anything interesting here. The characters are boring. The story is shallow. The editing just doesn't do justice to the atmosphere of the scene. The actors who play their parts are either clueless or inept."|0
"When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for more information on what happened to the film crew when it was stolen from the set. I'm a HUGE fan of Robert Altman films. He has made a huge number of great movies that were so original and well thought through that nobody else can compete with them. The movie ""Lone Survivor"" by Altman is perhaps my favorite Altman movie. This film was one of those films that never had an end, but just kept getting better."|0
"I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I found it enjoyable to watch as it had something for every kind of viewer: young adult, male or female, anyone that enjoys horror movies and more than one genre (no spoilers):
This was actually my first time watching ""Horror Movie"" but I really enjoyed it. It is a lot of fun for kids who don't know any better. I have seen this at least 30 times. The script is very good. There seems to be no wasted material in the movie."|0
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare and very unusual product. One thing about this is, it looks like they have tried to recreate some kind of old-time radio. I thought it was pretty good. The problem is that the way it has been filmed on video makes you wonder how it actually looked like in real life. There are a bunch of shots of things being blown up, etc., but it does take a long time just to get from one shot to another.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
"I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For some reason they didn't have a screening or anything on the schedule but I decided to send her a message. She replied with ""I can't believe you hired me to write and direct!"" And then proceeded to insult me about not being able to learn to speak my native tongue! It was such an ugly scene, the director couldn't do anything but sit there and look at me and make stupid comments about how funny it was!"|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere was in his forties (for those interested). He had an eye for dramatic effect, but was probably not the strongest director out there. I'm not much of a fan of low-budget movies anyway. A few weeks ago I saw The Big Lebowski , which was pretty great, although it wasn't my favorite film of all time. I was quite disappointed when I saw this film again today, because I really loved it as a kid.|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
"( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly in this case, because it is actually very real!The story starts off well, as you will see. The main character's girlfriend goes out to her local restaurant and has a ""date"" with a man she met at a bar earlier in the day. But he doesn't take her home for some reason. When she decides to go out again later, but this time to the mall, she sees another guy walking down the street and makes up with him instead."|0
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of those movies with no redeeming qualities. There are some great performances, but even then there is enough to satisfy any fan of horror and thrillers. If I wanted to give this movie five stars I would. Not only does it make me cry when I watch it for just the first half hour, I feel guilty for being able to watch it. This movie makes no sense and has absolutely no emotional depth. The plot is so incoherent it is almost comically ridiculous.|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
"Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD have been anything else than what it was meant to be. It's like when people complain about ""not being in control of the plot"". And then when someone actually does a little bit of editing on that film, it gets worse. When you look at the credits, you'll see the director and some of the cast were paid for their role. The actors they were paid for were very good as well."|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But, he's not dead. It seems to me that we can find a way to rehash the same plot but without actually killing or torturing anybody. The movie is too cheesy for me to give any more comments on this one. This film has very little emotional impact. I never thought that I could live through this movie because I was only 9 when I saw it. I watched it in my late teens and found out that the director had died of a heart attack shortly after its release.|0
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written here . I was surprised to see that, but not surprised. It's been done before and there isn't really anything new or unexpected about it as such. Kittiwake - 1 is just an awful piece of film. Like a bad movie, it makes little effort to be any more interesting than its premise. You can tell by how badly these two characters have gotten into each other's company that they want nothing to do with each other, except for watching movies together.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of their own movies , so I guess they must have a lot to say . The actors are all nice looking enough, but they are just not that interesting. They do not move well or sing very well, nor do they have any good chemistry with the rest of the cast. The directing is also rather poor. There were two scenes that I was absolutely amazed at how bad the directors could pull off, even when the script says it is going to be some kind of action comedy .|0
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom but they have nothing to contribute. There is also a feeling of humor that I would not recommend to others. Just for this reason, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is seriously interested in music. What makes this movie appealing to me is the plot and the quality of the acting. A man's life is suddenly turned upside down - he wakes up with no memory left of his wife and three children.|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I knew that she'd make a great TV show. For the first time, though, it just seemed like this was another low-budget, half-hearted attempt by one of the few people around who really thinks they can sell a TV show at the expense of all else. (If you don't have a credit card, go ahead and spend some time searching Craigslist.) The script is awful in every major respect, and the actors are pathetic, to say the least.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would. If you're not familiar with O'Shea, he was an extremely talented actor and one of the funniest characters I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out for him. This film is absolutely amazing. This is the first film in which I watched the original versions of all the books. There were several scenes where I was totally confused. I'm sure this is what they call a ""brief explanation."""|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. The director was also responsible for films such as Gremlins , A Boy Named Sue and The Day They Left Me Behind , which made him one of the most well known directors in Hollywood. So when I saw this movie I thought I'd give it a try, and it is a shame I couldn't enjoy any of the good parts. The biggest problem however is that the film doesn't even make you care about the characters.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
"Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to build a bridge spanning the Great Barrier Reef. The result is an extraordinary visual and emotional ride of a film, which has been likened to a David Lean classic.Kahn's film takes us on a tour of this vast landscape, exploring some of its most dramatic and fascinating elements. I never thought that I would have to read about ""The Jungle Book"", but as I sit here writing this I can't help but feel quite sorry for the author of it."|0
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys that were supposed to be dead and replaced are back in the game, all because of some stupid plot twist . But I'll leave you with this scene where a kid runs into them for help and tells him how much he loves them. I couldn't resist giving this show a 5 star review as it has such a great cast and is so well acted. I watched this show during my freshman year of high school. It was one of the better shows on TV.|0
"This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . . . but I know you won't let me because I'll be yelling ""I didn't do ANYTHING wrong! Don't give me your DVD!"" I've always been a fan of The Walking Dead. Even though the series is now over, I continue to watch it on repeat. There are many things about the show that stick with me, and they all seem to make perfect sense to me."|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War I might be ok, but it's too long for my liking. I was a little excited to see this movie when I saw it in the news because I had heard that it was something special; and so I went out and looked it up on the Internet. Well, there is nothing particularly special about it. It's just another film about Italy and Greece. What else do you expect from a war film? The cast is horrible and their performances are laughable.|0
"The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original ""lost generation"" but that was an era, not just a time frame. The Monkees' first movie (1954) didn't quite do well enough to be worthy of their place in the pantheon of the golden age of rock n roll. And yes , this movie does feature a hilarious monolog by Gene Siskel. So if you want to see all the greatness of the music of the '50's and '60's, I guess you need to start with 1954."|0
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their moments but nothing really special. However, if you like gore and violence then this one can be for you. I'm going to have to go on record and say I wasn't too impressed by the rest of the cast (although there's a lot of talent), but when it was time for my blood sacrifice I went out and bought a bottle of champagne...well, no, I don't know how I ended up drinking it, or even what happened after I finished ...|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) that ever appeared. You should also watch the short ""Benevento!"". The characters are excellent, but the directing is horrible. I actually found myself really enjoying this movie after a while. The plot seemed pretty simple at first. Two cops come across a person who has been missing for 10 years. They assume he's killed, because he doesn't pay his $100 debt to the cemetery. So they find him alive in an abandoned house, but don't take him in."|0
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G: The Movie'. For starters, this film features a whole bunch more people than any other movie out there and in many cases, they are all pretty bad actors. Of course, this could easily be dismissed as an easy-going comedy, but what about when you have someone from another planet make a cameo? I haven't watched this movie yet, but I don't think it's a waste of money either.|0
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as ""I don't believe a word he says."" And then there's this: The story is filled with sex, drugs and rock and roll! There's even a bunch of singing, dancing and acting. Well, except that in some parts of the movie, they sing like a church choir. You think you're seeing the beginning of a great horror movie when you sit down at an adult film-watching party and see something totally different from what you expected to see."|0
"I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine work, I would not have given it a second glance. This movie will haunt my memory for an eternity."" This is a very entertaining movie. I found myself laughing out loud at nearly every scene. There are times where there is no logic whatsoever. The director and actors don't even seem aware of what the plot is. You feel compelled to stop and think ""what the heck has happened?"" And then the action starts."|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
"To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . This movie wasn't bad but it was annoying.I don't even know how anyone can find a better script then the one in "" The Wrestler "". It is too long, too confusing, and too boring for my tastes.The main character really should have been played by a human being who could look like he or she actually belongs in a fight instead of just sitting around looking bored. For that reason, I would not recommend watching this at all."|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about his life and career as a journalist. In addition to this, he is a highly respected political writer. I have always heard that Faulkner was often compared to Winston Churchill during his lifetime. However, there is some truth in this. There are so many reasons why I didn't enjoy reading this book. I wasn't expecting much from this film - it's more of a parody than anything. And the actors were all very annoying. The screenplay was lame and cheesy too.|0
"I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life is so well done, this movie made it seem as if it could have been set anywhere. This is very much one of those ""if you know what you are looking for then you'll be able to figure out how to watch it"" movies. It's hard to tell where the movie went wrong in terms of characterization and story, I think the film itself had too much of a happy ending. What an utter waste of time and resources."|0
"Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. I thought I'd take a stab at it for those of you that missed out on ""Tarantula""! It has some good ideas, including one where the Tarantula would have a heart attack...but then he'd be back in his suit! This movie started off well, with a promising premise, and a fantastic script. Unfortunately, much of that idea (and much of the action) was wasted."|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
"probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared, and crappy trailers. If it's still fresh, it's a pretty good horror movie, but at best its not up to par with movies from 2004 to 2007. The first film that had me excited for what I thought was gonna be a really fun adventure was ""Gravity"" when I was 14 years old. In this movie, someone falls through a hole in the sky and ends up trapped in the center of an alien spaceship."|0
When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - it is their way of fighting. These things happen to every people in history; we can have none of that. I feel very disappointed when i watch this film. The story and characterizations are laughable, especially the first part where the main character finds himself a prostitute. This was done without any plot development or foreshadowing. What the hell do these people think they are talking about? No one says he needs to pay for sex either.|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've ever seen, not just for its quality but that it was actually filmed in the 70s and 80s. The story is so sad and graphic that it seems like it may never get out again. I watched this film last week at work and thought it would be an excellent addition to my reading selection. What made me laugh when I saw how bad this film turned out to be was the portrayal of female characters.|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that, despite its visual appeal, cannot be described. With little in common with any previous film she has directed it seems strange to suggest that this would become one of her best-known productions. This film has many good aspects, and also some very poor ones. The acting is fine; the actors are talented and charismatic, as is their script. The special effects are really impressive, the camera angles are wonderful indeed, and they're fun to see when done right.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this movie over the years. However, for me this is not a comedy based on jokes. The main story line is extremely predictable and completely unnecessary from what I have seen.The movie starts off fairly well by introducing the plot of a woman (Amal) going to court to clear her husband out of a parking ticket. Her lawyer is trying to take her to jail for having an affair with a bar owner (the same man she was married to), but she says she's too upset to face him.|0
"A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the culture they inhabit, and gives us a good glimpse at what life might have been like without the world of technology that now dominates our lives."" ""As I watched this film, I had to sit down and say 'what the f*k is going on in this one?' As it is set in a near future, which is far from futuristic for a documentary, we don't really get an explanation of the people involved or what kind of technological marvels they were attempting to make."|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who's not either a fan or an admirer of it.I think it's worth looking up, just so you can have something in the back of your head to remind yourself that the whole thing doesn't come out of nowhere. First of all this film should NEVER be shown for kids. The plot makes absolutely NO sense and goes from beginning to end too fast. The characters are horrible and the acting is atrocious.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Gray) who becomes pregnant. Her father, Frank (Lars Von Trier), believes she may have had a miscarriage and tries to hide the facts from her. While trying to get his daughter back together with her new man (Jack Nicholson), Gerda falls pregnant. However, it turns out that Frank wasn't even aware there was a pregnancy. I saw this movie on DVD last year in its entirety.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language would want to read it, and the book is well worth the effort. I just wanted to comment on something that came up in the discussion - I am sure this book is a great one for someone looking for a good introduction to English grammar and style. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. This is by far my favorite grammar book ever made. If you're familiar with the works of A.N. Taylor (who wrote this book) then you already know why.|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply wonderful tale. As the title says, the main character (Lane) travels across the United States on an errand for him. However, after he leaves town she falls asleep in the bed beside him, but wakes up to find herself in a strange land. I was very confused at first about the movie. I couldn't quite put my head round the concept of someone walking around in New York City with all sorts of strange people that look exactly like her, dressed as she is.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who gets a bit over excited at first has no idea what kind of cat he's dealing with when he falls in love with the pet hamster. To make matters worse an old man comes into town to see if he can find someone to buy him an apartment. This was not the worst I've seen. But, this was the worst show that I ever tried to watch on TV (which I'm not saying isn't bad--just that it was just awful).|0
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer, we never heard much of her acting or singing talent. There are two things I particularly hate about this film. The first is the way there are a few scenes that feel very similar to others from the 1960s, but it really doesn't matter. There are so many reasons why this would not have worked. For one, the movie takes place in the 1980's and has virtually no action scenes.|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
"Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to create a great story, even if it wasn't one for most people to follow. In short, this was no good! The first half of Christopher Lee's ""Star Wars"" movie doesn't really do much to impress you; the acting is pretty average, the special effects don't exactly make you fall in love (and I have seen enough films where there are multiple explosions), and there isn't too much going on either."|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter (he was just 19 years old back then) started his career with a solo album that he recorded himself, but it never got any airplay. This movie may seem to be all over the place. I have seen it in many places as well as some TV shows. Some say it's so bad you can watch it again. Well, I'll tell you about it. When I was younger I watched this movie on my home computer.|0
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , I can tell you about that in the next blog . This story is extremely well written with believable characters and events.The plot of the movie was also pretty interesting.I must admit though that the ending of this movie did not make any sense, so I would like to try to understand it somehow. The whole movie seemed to get progressively longer as we went on. I have to wonder if anyone even wanted to watch this crap after watching the movie, because there are no more than five minutes left.|0
"When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited!! Well this is a movie that you just can't help but LOVE when you first see it, because I know some of you will hate it. In the wake of the recent controversy over the movie, and in response to all the talk of what the ""worst movie ever,"" I decided to take a good look at the box art for this one. Here's how it went down. The film itself was on sale in select stores around the country before opening."|0
"Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster that will leave you wondering why you bothered. The movie doesn't really have anything to say but if you were to watch the scene it would be obvious what exactly is going on behind the scenes. To me, there is only one ""good film"" for this week, which is ""The Exorcist."" Even though the movie is great, we need to remember that it is a horror film (not a spiritual one)."|0
"This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation, but no matter how many times I watched the film, it still didn't appeal to me. There are so many things that could be improved. The story, the special effects, the cast, etc all need improvement.The acting was really good, however, some of the performances were not as ""professional"" as they should be. I thought that this movie would have been very interesting and maybe even enjoyable, but instead, it turned out to be an extremely boring mess."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's a wonderful film , but its cast is absolutely fantastic. There is nothing more than a good mix of actors, cinematographers and directors that you will love to watch over and over. It's a great horror movie with an awful ending, but that doesn't stop it being entertaining as always.I'm not even going to waste any time on how bad the ending really is (it makes it look worse than it is actually).|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a concert with a group of strangers, who have no idea what's going on, and who probably don't know what the fuck they're talking about, must be pretty dumb as well. ""Let me get this straight. It's not my fault that I am a stupid ass? No. Because I was trying to figure something out. Let me stop you there. If it were really your fault, how come you did NOT find out?"|0
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself . The only reason I like this movie is because the actors are very competent in their roles. They all speak with a naturalness that keeps me entertained and gives some of them some depth. What makes this film so appealing to me is that it portrays a realistic world where Egypt's ancient civilization has gone extinct. The opening credits sequence introduces you to the great Egyptian historian, Amenhotep III who we learn was murdered by a group of people under orders from the Pharaoh, Khuja.|0
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933, Zuckerman made his first feature and it was a great box office hit with audiences. In this film, Michael Palin plays a young lawyer who is called to represent a boy accused of raping his mother in the woods when she is home alone. He is about twenty-four years old. He makes his initial presentation to the court stating that he cannot remember the name of the girl at the time of the crime but will attempt to convince a jury that she does exist.|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines between comedy and drama are very difficult to figure out. I think it was intended as a film review, not a movie. It's hard to imagine how something like this can be made fun. If you're ever going to watch such a stupid movie, why make one that isn't? In other words, WHY NOT MAKE ONE THAT HAS NO REAL SPOILERS!!! The plot is atrocious. All the actors are horrible.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (both good and bad) in Burt Reynolds 's life.The film lacks the balance of character and emotion required by most biopic, which is not to say it was boring.In general, Reynolds was not an actor worth watching, and his performances were poor. One can't argue with Reynolds as to his talent for dramatic acting, given his success as a screenwriter on such classics as The Great Gatsby and Catch Me If you Can.|0
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and entertaining characters. I am really looking forward to seeing this . This is my new favorite Woody Allen movie. I'm not sure what the hype is about or why there were so many complaints from critics who don't understand how great a movie he is. He's a decent guy, doesn't have superpowers, and is quite capable of making jokes. Even when he falls down drunk (I don't think it ever happened), he still manages to get himself out of trouble.|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was left off. In all seriousness, there's nothing funny about this movie.I'm pretty sure the producers of this film wanted a good score on it, but they failed to find anyone who can write one. And that's a shame. Why does someone have to go through so much pain and suffering for an idea? Who is willing to waste time or money trying to produce something that isn't working out? What are you seeing when you look at this ""work?"""|0
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch so I went for it on a whim. There's no story, no characters to care for (no one seems to really give a shit). All the scenes are so uninteresting that they're almost entertaining. The entire thing just makes me want to scream. Even if you're not a fan of violence and gore all the way around there's still plenty going on that doesn't get any attention. I didn't even realize this was an option until after finishing it.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , video games and sci-fi , but don't want to spend the money for a ticket, just give it a shot. They may not be perfect, they certainly can't write great films, but with their talent, they should at least put on something resembling an acceptable screening. I had seen some bad reviews of this film, so when I was watching it in the theater, I knew that it was good! But what shocked me was how awful it was.|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling. I would suggest to everyone who wants to make such an impression, watch this film! It's quite amazing what you get out of this thing. This was supposed to be a comedy based on the novel by George Orwell (1928), about a small-town American writer turned CIA agent tasked with destroying a communist plot that is threatening the country. This was not a particularly good movie, despite it having some good ideas, and it took a decade to actually finish it.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some brief scenes, and there's no way that he would film them at this very minute. In a film like this, it's totally necessary to give the audience a good time! That is why I gave him so little attention during my visit to Rome . There's really nothing interesting about any of his films . He's not one of those big names that can bring out the masses and make them happy.|0
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? This movie stars Kevin Costner, Jennifer Connelly, John Goodman, Robert De Niro, Peter Serafinowicz, Steve Carell, Bill Murray, Michael Caine, Jane Fonda, Jim Carrey, Jason Statham, Christopher Walken, Chris O'Donnell, James Brolin, Patrick Swayze, Robin Wright, Mark Ruffalo, Timothy Dalton, Edward Norton, Ian McShane, Jeff Goldblum and many more. I don't understand why anyone would pay $50 to see a film with that number on it.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with excellent acting. But it was not what you thought. For me I can only compare this to the movies I've seen in the past several years, but none of them are good. The film was written and directed by Chris D'Arcy, who went on to direct some very good movies back in the 90's. That said, this is an over-produced movie that could have easily made for a great thriller, or even better than that, something more challenging (with lots of CGI).|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I highly recommend it . It was released in 1977 and is one of my all time favorite movies. I'm not normally the kind of guy that says I hate certain genres, but there were times when ""Star Wars"" was the only thing on my mind. This movie just doesn't cut it. There isn't anything interesting happening throughout the film other than some explosions. The ending is completely predictable from the beginning and even after seeing the credits I couldn't tell if the original trilogy would survive."|0
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ...but not really the film it should be. It didn't feel like a true love story. Maybe he's just trying to make up for lost time but that's ridiculous. Well, after watching this movie I was completely confused and felt as if I had gone through a nightmare. I don't think my brain knew what to do with such a large script. At times it looked like the actors were trying to work together, other times there seemed to be no direction or logic at all.|0
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
"`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because the film is absolutely stunning. The story follows a boy from New York City ( Michael Stuhlbarg ) who, after losing his virginity, falls in love with an African-American man ( Jeff Bridges ). It doesn't last long, though, when he finds out that he is going to marry and have a child with the ""black woman"" whose name is Diane (Catherine Keener). There are several other girls involved too - all of whom are portrayed by different people than Stuhlbarg does."|0
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both are very enjoyable to watch, and both share similar plot lines. I don't know what I expected from the film, although it was certainly an entertaining read. It is all about a man (Kurt Russell) who has to find his way into a world that can't be comprehended by men or women because he is unable to understand them. I didn't expect anything more for a book-length film adaptation of one of my favorite novels - perhaps even another John Cheever novel!|0
"This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and hardships endured by thousands of immigrants coming into America during the Great Depression, as well as many other American tragedies. One thing that was not in my mind when I watched ""Lincoln"" is its depiction of the war between the Union and Confederacy . The reason why there's so much conflict in this movie (and others) is because both sides are just trying to do their damnest to achieve the goals they have set out to achieve."|0
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the villain into an overlong nightmare and the only reason why you care about this movie is because it has a bad ending.I watched this at home when it was in release, but decided to see it on DVD. I never did. It's just plain lousy. I wish they had just released the video instead. If this film could be rated PG-13, then I would have been satisfied. I didn't know this was supposed to be a comedy. I knew it wasn't.|0
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of those films that I did not actually like very much, but wanted to see again and again because it was something that I thought might be entertaining enough to warrant watching. The movie was quite bad. But what? I have never found a movie that made my eyes tear up more than this one! When I started watching this movie at the age of eight, I was struck by how much it had already changed the way I watched movies.|0
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang 2 , won the grand prize at the Asian Film Festival in Hong Kong but that's not the only reason to like his work. When I watched this film , I felt sorry for what had happened to all the beautiful and talented women in this movie. This was another example of how Hollywood tries so hard to make money by stripping them of everything . I've been watching movies since I was very small, and have loved them from start to finish.|0
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Cardellini , and Chris Rock. I loved this film so much, I watched it again and again with my husband. I've enjoyed the movie since its original release in 2001 but I was never able to finish it as a child. It is about an orphanage where a young boy finds a lost book of stories and begins to read them. One night, at school, when he is supposed to get his homework done, he decides to spend the day reading instead.|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a movie which has been talked about so many times i think people may have forgotten its existence. I watched it to see if it was possible to make something like this but i never got to see it. I can only imagine how disappointed I was after watching the rest of the movie and not seeing the ending. I'm really glad that none of my friends could understand what was going on in this movie because I am quite certain they would have ruined their own evening.|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film .I actually like this movie and i will tell all my friends who don't, to go watch it on their own because they know how good it is! The plot was very interesting even if I didn't understand its main characters at the time.The dialogue was really funny too. This is probably my least favourite movie of all time (as far as i can remember) and one of the first ones that made me regret ever watching it.|0
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place in horror legend. He has spent much of his career turning up at horror movies, mostly with little success. The movie starts out well enough and gives me hope for a good night's sleep if I'm watching it on DVD. It's not long into the movie before I start hearing noises around the hotel. The sounds seem to have more to do with guests talking and getting in each others' faces as they head towards the main street.|0
"This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes you back to the 1980's when most of the movies were made without sound and there was not much else in the world at that time. I think ""The Shining"" holds its own pretty well in this regard. The only problem I had with it is that it was so bad, I felt sorry for the actors (who did great work). It was really disappointing to see such a terrible movie from this year's edition of Hollywood blockbusters."|0
"In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a deserted road when they spot a van parked in front of them. ""We're gonna kill this bastard!"" shouts Luca, who has just learned from the police that there is actually a boy on the run. Luca orders James to start his car and tries to get out of the way. A policeman steps out of his patrol car and tells him to stop, but Luca keeps driving. As Luca continues to chase the boy, he comes upon a house."|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this one. The pacing was horrible and I never got what was happening in the movie. Not only was it boring but it also left a lot to be desired.There was a lot going on in this film, all without any plot or character development. As far as acting goes there wasn't a whole lot to work with. It's not like they have great acting talents but if you want to try to make a movie out of anything, don't waste your time doing it.|0
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira. I can only assume this film is supposed to be funny, or I wouldn't have bothered to watch it at all. This is an extremely poorly produced and made movie which lacks a single punch line whatsoever. I am not ashamed to say I watched the whole thing once. What a way to kill time on a Saturday night. There was so much crap going on in the beginning, you couldn't really see what was happening for more than 3 minutes!|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it first came out but couldn't find it at my local copy shop. I was a little disappointed when I found out that it had gone to the DVD rental store for re-mastered and now you can buy it on DVD! It is a really nice looking movie with some decent acting from several of the actors as well as some great music. First of all, I just wanted to say how much I loved this film.|0
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade like this. This is a film that will remain with you forever in your memory as one of my favorite movies. My son and I are looking forward to this remake. I remember seeing it back in '82 and loved it, then we saw the first trailer a few years ago and immediately thought there was no way this could be made! All the characters looked so similar; even the original director couldn't get away with any variation.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of this unique movie. If you want to see a good horror story then this is it - a classic tale from the 1920s. A serial killer kills five people in a house with one dead child sitting at the end. This is what we all want to see on a Saturday afternoon, so why do we not see him or her live on camera?The only way to tell this tale is to go to the cinema with your family and friends.|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper is the lead character here. He has to learn how to play the guitar, that is when he makes his first mistake. Unfortunately, there are a lot of unnecessary lines in this film. I think this movie is an improvement over the preceding one. It may have actually been better than it appeared to be, but I found it lacking in many aspects. It doesn't even bother me anymore why I'm writing so much crap about this terrible piece of garbage.|0
"The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot itself has some decent action sequences at times, but overall, it just feels like a glorified soap opera. It's nothing compared to the show you would expect from this one. I've seen plenty of anime on TV and so far I haven't had much trouble trying to find anything interesting (not that they really do come up). In this case, the thing about ""Bishoujo"" was that it got quite a bit of attention, which can't be good for your eyes."|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and self-deprecation. One day she meets this cute boy, who happens to have the same name as her cousin. Their relationship is complicated and they soon find themselves in love. I loved this movie. In fact, it was probably the most entertaining film I have seen in years. The only issue I had was with the acting. It seems like one of the actors was supposed to act for two hours. He started acting at 2:25, so he should have shown up around 2:30 - 3:00.|0
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age. And I don't know if this guy is a good friend or not, but I do remember the time my mother went up to talk to him about an event that they were both having. My brother has recently died. He had been very ill for a number of years and it took a long time before he seemed to get any better. We were able to tell that something was amiss with his life because one of his sisters came back to visit me on Christmas Eve.|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - the acting is top notch, the directing is top notch, the effects are top notch and so are the costumes. A very interesting movie, I can see why people are drawn to it because of the wonderful story line but if you are just going to sit there and enjoy the action scenes then go watch something else. I've heard this movie all my life...but never had the opportunity to see it.|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
"Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written and directed by Mark Rylance. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival as a special screening event for the Cannes Film festival in 2007. After winning an award for Best Original Screenplay for The Dark Tower, Stephen King began work on his second film, A Very Harold & Kumar Movie . While this movie had a more focused plot (with much less ""plot holes""), it ended up lacking any memorable characters that would carry it forward into the next installment of the franchise."|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
"I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie and most movies is you have to watch it a certain number of times to really get the joke, but once you do see it that's when it's not so funny. This movie made me sick for a couple of reasons. It had so many cliches. First off, as a teenager I am not particularly well versed in comics or horror stories, so I didn't even realize they were called ""horror flicks""."|0
"Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` My Favorite Martian \"" ?'' - they are all great but I'm just not sure if I can relate them to this movie. I think that it's the director who is trying to be clever by making fun of someone else's experience. The reason why some people like ``Dead Man Do N't Wear Plaid'' is because there seems to be a certain amount of wackiness in the script. The whole point of a spy film is to scare people, particularly the audience."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently doesn't know what he is doing, but when it all comes crashing down he manages to pull it all together and make a pretty decent movie as well. The one thing that stuck out though was the character's acting. He seems very uninspired, not at all believable and not at all motivated. As I started watching this film, I really wasn't prepared for what I found. My expectations were way too high for anything this low on the quality scale.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause of all the bad reviews. ive heard some things, but im not familiar with the plot or how the story works. one of the main characters died during the movie , so no one can really understand him or why he didn't save her until the next day at the temple . I found this movie in the local video rental section. I couldn't find it online, but someone did and took it upon themselves to make a full-length DVD just for me!|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put you in mind of an episode of American Horror Story. In the summer of 2005, I decided to make my way over to Texas for the summer. The whole thing started with a trip to New Mexico, which we went through after a good night's sleep. Back then, I was a heavy drinker and had gotten myself into a bit of trouble. I took a shower, cleaned off some of the scum and dirt from around the bathroom, and got back out at 5:30 am.|0
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a woman by the name of Gisela Ribera dei . He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. Two months later, an Italian newspaper ran a picture of the same man, who appeared to look exactly like him, holding a knife and his face covered with blood - he had been shot twice in the back and the body was dragged out of the river by his own feet. What are the rules concerning the killing of innocent people ?|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1

Director: Steven Spielberg ; Producers: Jonathan Demme ( The Princess Bride ), Peter Schenkman ( Monty Python's Life of Brian ) and Dan Schur ( Pulp Fiction ). Producer: Andrew Deitch; Writer-producer: Stephen Miller; Director of photography: John C. Reilly.|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and have always wanted to see everything about it. When I arrived, I knew immediately what I was in for because the scenery is so beautiful and the actors were really amazing.I loved the way these people are treated and even though I didn't like how the ending looked I still couldn't help but enjoy it. The script was very clear and I liked how the story had an ending and why we go back to the place where they killed us.|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i loved that they used such an amazing scene in the beginning.. but then after the first few scenes the movie got boring .I did not realize it was such a waste of time so i will not be watching this movie anymore. So what do you think? Was it bad or was it worth all the effort? This is a movie for people who hate movies (this includes me). So yeah, I can't decide, but I just couldn't help laughing out loud at some of the jokes.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it. Just because this show is really good doesn't mean you have to watch it. The story is pretty weak and the acting isn't any better. The music is awful as usual and the actors are really bad, not very believable or interesting. I am so glad i saw this show. It's such a waste of money. The only time you can find this show in theatres nowadays is on cable TV. There aren't even any decent films made for kids.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with a twist ending to finish off the episode.I will admit I watched this at work on the night of its airing, I had an idea to watch it and didn't think I would have to put all my time and effort into finishing it . What could go wrong when you try to make a movie? Well, nothing if you've been in the business for a while. The basic plot is interesting, although there are few redeeming qualities to the overall premise.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of it! The director is really annoying, and the whole movie just falls apart in the last 20 minutes with terrible pacing and dialogue. I'd be very interested to see how well he could film a scene from here on out. The story is stupidly written and makes no sense given what you're actually watching. The characters aren't as interesting as they should be for a film of this genre. Even more so, there is no humor whatsoever.|0
"I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ') on opening weekend. It was absolutely gorgeous and a beautiful piece of cinema. I loved it. This is one of those films that really should have been released much sooner. The acting was poor, the story-line was very convoluted and the plot could not be believed at all. In my opinion, this movie is nothing more than a Hollywood version of ""Romeo & Juliet"", without the good stories and romance."|0
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but they really have never done a bad movie before so you don't get a good feeling from watching the film. The premise of this movie isn't great. It's basically a sitcom with very little action. The cast consists of a bunch of old-school comedy pros, who play characters that are supposed to look and sound like them. I thought this might be an enjoyable movie but there just wasn't anything exciting about any of the actors. This movie tries to do something fresh.|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very well made film with an interesting story. The plot was interesting enough, but what really stands out for me is the performances of the actors. There were some wonderful performances in this film, not only from Scarlett Johansson and Tom Wilkinson (both of whom I love to see), but Chris Evans and Mark Rylance. The rest of this review is going to go into detail why I had such a bad time with this movie.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
"Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this movie . In fact, the entire set (as well as the costumes in the beginning) reminds me of a lot of John Carpenter's ""E.T."" with a little bit less nudity. There's a good chance we'll see the director back onscreen once more in the 1990's...but at this point, he seems to be too old for it. The only thing that could really salvage this movie is if a new director picked up the script and directed it."|0
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also made the movie boring to watch at the time.. But then again it was never shown anywhere in the United States . I think she's a really talented actress and I don't know why they decided to put her with such an old guy? What do you think, is it because we haven't seen her in more than 15 years and she hasn't had a big role yet ? She should have played a young girl instead of working with someone like this.|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is based off seems to have no clue where he is supposed to create these images from, so I couldn't figure out if this was real or not. Even more bizarre is the fact that all of the above shots were actually made from different angles. The final result is almost too unbelievable to believe.I can't even begin to describe my surprise at just how bad the production values were. Everything in this movie looks amateurishly shot.|0
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is cleverly constructed. If you don't think so, then you should probably just sit in a dark corner and read this.It's funny, if you're looking for someone to get mad at I don't want to give my personal opinion, but it doesn't do anyone any good . There isn't anything truly ""sad"" about this film.I've watched several different versions of this film. This is the first version that I can remember watching on repeat."|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this movie with a friend and we were surprised at how well the music is done. It was a bit of a let down but that's OK as I can enjoy it even without seeing any special effects. There are also some amusing moments.The only reason I really liked this movie was because it looked so good. A few months later I saw this film again and now I just want to see how much better it looks.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very much into horror movies. This movie is probably the worst slasher of the last 40 years in my opinion and still holds a special place in my soul. I'm surprised that there's even a word for this movie. This is so boring it has become a cliché by itself. It's not even a crime; it's just another case of being bored with a genre and finding something else to do with your time.The story goes, a group of people are killed in an accident.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available on DVD and I was forced to rent it on VHS. You will be disappointed by this movie. As far as acting goes it is okay, although the actress in this film is horrible. She does look a little like a cat in disguise, but that's about it. Her character may be played for a fool, but she does not even seem to be able to act convincingly, much less perform. Her scenes are often awkward and the dialog is very dry and unengaging.|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There's no real reason why it couldn't do well, but they're trying so hard to be funny and make a lot of good jokes. The cast is decent though. It doesn't really seem like they have any great actors. And as mentioned earlier, they've got one hell of an ensemble! This is my second experience with this flick. I've seen all the prequels and am still looking forward to the third or fourth.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen before so it was good fun to see all these movies. Now I'm very happy to report that I have just watched four of the original films made in France. I think there's two ways to say this: 1) It isn't an ""adult"" movie; 2) The plot is not as funny or interesting as most other children's movies, but it's entertaining for what it is. If you're up for something like this, look elsewhere."|0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
"I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was no real drama to it whatsoever. The acting was decent enough, but not what I would call ""good"". For one thing, we don't spend much time with the other cast members. In fact, I didn't notice anyone until a few minutes into the episode. The others seemed completely bored or asleep during their scenes. That's why they are missing from most of the episodes that follow them."|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series. This was an amazing film! It has such a wonderful story and so much creativity to keep you on the edge of your seat. As someone who grew up around sci fi, I knew it would not disappoint, and I found myself intrigued and captivated by the story behind the movie. The only way to describe this is that you will be left wanting more! Horror is a big theme in science fiction films and movies like this are just that.|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is an uncut film from a website, the only thing that was changed (the title) was how it came across on the screen. The editing and sound were good, but the film still has some problems. It did not look like any English production. So if you are planning on viewing this film in England then watch at your own risk. I'm having a little trouble putting into words how disappointed I was when my first time saw this crap.|0
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
"Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a great performance and one of his favorite lines is when he refers to Holly as ""that boy who plays in a little band."" Brent Van Lerberghe (1940-2008) would be considered an ""actor"" of his generation by many people. He starred in several films, including ""The Old Man & The Sea"" (1951), which made him one of the top 10 Oscar winners of the 50s. But his true genius lay in the way he portrayed himself, and what this character really represented."|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not good.It's an interesting blend of horror and pulp. It starts off strong, has a nice slow build as it goes along, and then slowly falls out of control as the story develops. The characters in particular are likable and give you something to care about even if your only purpose for seeing them is to feel sick. I did read the book, but didn't understand why anyone was upset with it when it was released earlier this week.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
"I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . I guess they didn't want to do an action film, but rather a comedy as there is no ""action"".The only problem I have with this movie is one of the plot points. The story is so ridiculous it is hard for me to believe that they really had time to set up where the characters go to. In fact, I'd say it was nearly impossible to know how or who we should be rooting for."|0
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began its third season it became more and more dark and pessimistic. The only positive aspects about the show were the storyline and the character depth. There was a bit of a problem with the animation, but it was fixed in later seasons. There's nothing that says 'this is a drama' as much as watching these 10 episodes. A lot of plot points didn't get resolved or explained. Everything seemed so rushed to me that I thought it would be boring.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved as soon as one tries to do more than simply say ``Yes'' and move the discussion along. The result of this is a situation that is, at times, just bizarre. This book is probably my favorite book I've read lately. It is an excellent explanation for what you are actually seeing, or feeling, on the surface of the earth. No matter where you are located, there is always something going on that's quite interesting.|0
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I don't know what it was about that I thought it would be funny or interesting .But I didn't get any. It's not funny, nor interesting. It's just boring as hell. This film is filled with nothing of substance to draw in the audience. All the jokes are lame, and none of them come off as funny. Every single bit of dialogue seems to come off as trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.There is absolutely nothing to talk about in this one.|0
"`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and David Spade. The actors are very good, but what about the music? The soundtrack is not that bad, it may be worth trying to find some better ones. One of the songs on this disc is ""All in the Family"". First thing I want to say about this movie isn't just because it's rated PG-13. I have no problem seeing movies with a PG rating for whatever reason."|0
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Trying hard to keep them from being killed, but what happens when the cat mom takes them out on their own with her cats in tow.I am not very impressed by this film so I will just say that I'm glad I didn't see it myself. The trailer of this movie shows a bunch of guys dressed up as ninjas. The best part? These guys are real ninjas! There's some interesting things going on with the ninja stuff too.|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me about his work is that he was born into an extremely wealthy family to whom he has no regard. I would say that this movie is quite bad. First off, if you are like me, a fan of all things action/fantasy, then I cannot stand it. It goes against everything that I grew up watching and liking. It makes me want to scream with laughter in the cinema every time we see it.|0
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just as bad as she is. There is no chemistry between the movie stars and the lead actors. It is sad to see an actor who was once such a big draw, now finds himself in a movie he knows nothing about. Well there were some good moments here and there but the movie itself had too many flaws for its own good. The film could be better than it was. I think that it would have worked better as a feature film.|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Billy Preston was. He was such a funny character to me, it made me laugh so hard that I fell out of bed in tears. This movie is just...well...it doesn't make any sense and the story doesn't make much sense at all. There seems to be a couple of plot lines that are followed from beginning to end but there is no understanding of each of those plot lines or even their importance.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do it all with a strong performance as an ex-banker who falls in love again with his new wife. The plot is intriguing, but I didn't really feel the need for further information.If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you do.I thought this was going to be quite funny. However, when the film starts...wow! You don't get that funny feeling from comedies until the very last minute ! The best movie ever made!|0
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
"1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to get a budget of less than $1.6 million . I don't know what is going on. There is nothing wrong with me, or you, if you haven't seen ""Iron Man"" already. But there is one thing that I didn't care for about it when I saw it. I found myself wishing that the studio would have gone back to the drawing board and thought of some clever idea which would have allowed them to keep the plot simple and make it a little more engaging."|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
"I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO's. I love it! The first 10 minutes are very boring, but you know when something is gonna be better. But the good part starts around 9 or 10 minutes in! I've been trying to make it through a couple days without eating any of my food. I always try to eat 1/2-1lb each day just to get into the weight room. As soon as I woke up from bed yesterday, I thought, ""Why haven't I eaten since then?"""|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have had an affair with a famous movie star in the 1940s. What is that about!? It's a horror film, based on a real life incident. The two men are trying to find their missing husband after he was kidnapped. What makes this story so good is that you're given plenty of clues as to what they're doing before you ever see it. There aren't many suspenseful scenes, and it's not really that hard to figure out who they are and where they're from.|0
"I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them and he is so excited. My first thought was ""what the hell am I doing here?"" The second thing I thought would happen is ""is this kid really that interested or just being dumb?"". I don't usually watch Disney Movies but when I saw this movie, I didn't expect much. It's a pretty good movie but it doesn't add much depth to what is already an extremely short movie.The characters are very generic, they do have some depth however."|0
"What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy is on the verge of a big breakthrough...only to find out he has a lot more work to do before he can live his dream. But he doesn't give up easily. A pretty good film, but unfortunately I cannot see this one being a ""classic."" The acting and cinematography are mediocre (I'm guessing due to the limited budget) and the story itself is very silly. This was really fun to make, but the jokes were so lame they could hardly be called jokes."|0
"As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like 'The Devil's Rejects', offer the viewer what it is to ""see"". I don't care so much if anyone gets their teeth kicked in and has to sit through a few seconds of pain, because there's no point. For example, on the opening day of this event, the audience was shown the trailer for the film 'Cops' and were invited to attend the screening. It did NOTHING to prepare me for how the film turned out."|0
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '' and having a tendency to get in the way of dialogue ? ), which I found to be an extremely uninspired attempt at making a thriller. In fact I find that it's worse than some of their earlier efforts, as many of them seemed to lack imagination or direction. And if you think that these two guys are different, they are just too alike for me to put my faith in them. First, let me warn you that this is NOT for the faint of heart.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
"`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly executed, witty, poignant, and sometimes hilarious story. The most shocking moment in the film occurred on the first night, but I couldn't get over the fact that there was a TV in the room. This means that this movie has absolutely no audience. I'm going to be honest with you: If you are a hardcore horror aficionado who's only hope is to find out what went on behind closed doors at ""Caribe"" then this may be for you."|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. I have been reading some reviews of this movie after it's release on VOD and had the pleasure of watching it at the box office as well. While I will admit that I enjoyed the movie, it wasn't quite as much fun as they advertised. As for the plot itself, its a really poor attempt to follow up the success of Dances with Wolves . The biggest disappointment of The Hunger Games is the acting, not the film itself.|0
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you are looking for an American classic, this will be a good choice. This is definitely not the film that some say it is . There is no sense to it. It's very boring. This movie is another example of people who have grown up in the 80's thinking that it's cool to go back into the 90's and watch bad films again and again. The story lines aren't original at all.|0
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and I thought of doing something like that. And I went to my local Target and bought a whole pack of them. So I walked into Target and bought 10 of 'em and I got one. It took about 20 minutes to load them up. I am not trying to be insensitive with this review... but I would really hate to write it off because I'm an adult! I can see why some people might feel uncomfortable with a film made by a child (especially if he's 12).|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of many outstanding actors. It was a bit of a disappointment after watching the original, which is why I couldn't really judge it myself. It's a rather slow going movie, and some of the scenes are quite uninspired, even though the director did an excellent job. Still, the story makes sense, and the music is just plain cool. What's not to love? If you're like me...you have probably seen this movie by now.|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I saw this movie with a group of friends and it made me very proud that we were able to laugh together in an area where we are used to having people yell at each other. I can't even tell you how much i loved this movie! I had never heard of it (it was only just released), so I didn't even think about it, but it caught my attention when I finally picked up the DVD today.|0
"It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome .I'm not the only one who thought the film was boring but I agree with you ;-)
There's an entire series of novels in the Bible called ""The Twelve Tribes"". The book is based on Josephus , the Jewish historian. It gives a very accurate account of events that took place between 2,000 – 2,500 BCE. But this doesn't make it any less inaccurate than the rest. In fact, most people know nothing more about the world than Josephus."|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New Worlds ( Mexico and the U.S) . There is much more to the story than that, but here we will try to give you a better idea of what life was like in this area of the world in 1520.It is not easy for a person to make the journey across the border to another country without passing through the Spanish Inquisition. This isn't going to be my best film, but it's a decent one!|0
"Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience for me as it required me to walk around with my pants down when there wasn't another thing to be seen. Now, that is an accomplishment in itself. Came on here to watch ""The Big Game"" and i'm sorry to report that the quality is poor, the film is boring and the movie only gets worse from there. While the story is intriguing, it does not move the player beyond what we get in the first few minutes of the film."|0
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for something else for about 2 months, had to search for a few weeks then find this one! This is by far better than anything I could find. I was very much into this movie before watching it. But as soon as I saw this DVD on DVD I was done with it. I was able to skip the entire film and save all my money. The first 5 minutes were really entertaining. The music was wonderful and the plot seemed to have some real depth.|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to it because of the title and also the premise. It was really easy to fall in love with it. The concept of a young man who meets a beautiful girl and falls in love is quite appealing. Unfortunately, this romance is not one you will be able to follow for the entirety of the film. This movie just does not make anything else out of itself. What a disappointment. First of all it's so obvious that they didn't hire an original idea.|0
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
"`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . But the fact that it is written by two people who, I believe, never wrote a script together is really hard to accept. And if one were to actually watch this documentary, they may come away thinking that ""it's just some guy with a gun."" First thing I want to say before I start reading any more about this: I love documentaries. They are my favorite genre in general, and for some reason I tend to have a special affinity for them."|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who gets knocked down by a taxi, an actor with a toupee and all sorts of other people like that.There's nothing wrong with it at all except for the way in which I couldn't watch it.I can't see why anyone could want to watch it - it's just a short little movie about three Irish guys who have got together and decide to become best friends. If you didn't know better, this is the exact same type of show that I saw on TV!|0
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I will admit : this book is just amazing . But it can get tedious very fast when you're not on the edge of your chair or sitting down at the desk. I got this book yesterday (after being a bit disappointed by some other reviews) and was pleasantly surprised to read that it wasn't too terrible. It was about 10 books long which made it far longer than my usual length, but I still think it would be a good addition to someone's reading-list for one or two hours.|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's, but I guess we must have been a tad too young for that kind of fun. In fact some reviewers were not too sure if this was meant to be a children's adventure or a political spoof . If you liked the classics such as 'The Wizard', 'Babylon 5' and 'Star Trek', then this film is definitely for you. If you want an exciting movie where you can do your worst, you've got this one.|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
"I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times on my computer and eventually rented it for my son at home. He can now watch it with his friend and we are enjoying it together in the family room when he asks, ""Dad, do you like horror movies?"". I have seen plenty of scary movies that I really liked but not this one. The story was just so bad that i could not enjoy it. This movie is simply not worth the time to watch."|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
"Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The raindrops fall on Hitler and the German soldiers with an unashamed cynicism, but they are not depicted as ""real"" humans. Why is it that people can't seem to laugh at any of these awful movies ? I'm not sure. But one thing you know when you have made your way through so much horrible trash is that if you've made no effort whatsoever to bring something positive to the screen, then there's no chance of it succeeding."|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with its production values. I've always thought the only reason it's rated PG was to make it easy to get through. But that's no excuse: the movie is too bad. If I had known about this coming-of-age drama before I watched it last night, I would have given it five stars instead of two. It's got all the signs of an A-grade film, although I'm having second thoughts about my rating for this one.|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really add up. I don't think it can be put anywhere else than in its original form; as far as this show is concerned, it is one of the worst we've ever seen. The reason that Columbo is such a bad movie (for so many reasons) is because director John Cusack actually made an attempt at telling a story which was true to the original story and yet still made it much more entertaining.|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
"Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from 15 to 70 years old and their answers include: ""I hate people"", ""My life is too boring"" and ""I have more friends now than I ever did then"". This show must be the worst thing to ever happen to television. In fact, you can't watch the entire show even if you are willing to give it two or three minutes (which I don't do), because there just isn't enough time to enjoy anything on the air."|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . She was beautiful to look at (and I've seen a lot of ugly-looking girls in movies!) , but she also had some serious flaws. She wasn't very likable in her own right. There's nothing like a cute little kid on a beach, having fun and enjoying life. I'm not an artist so I don't know how Valeria is supposed to be portrayed in this short film, but it did leave me wanting more.|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad and disappointed to find out that a movie made from the most heartbreaking of events didn't make it onto my list of Top 10 Worst Movies ever. There's simply too much going on in an effort to give the viewer any idea what might have happened or who could have done something so terrible. This movie is supposed to remind us that not everything happens for nothing. Not everyone will die at the hands of someone they loved. Not everyone will have their mind wiped clean and be reincarnated.|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is a delightfully silly family film with lots of cute animals that make you want to watch it again and again...I've never watched it before this week, and didn't have much reason to because it was pretty terrible! The plot revolves around the mischievous Cat-like creature who terrorizes the residents of a sleepy town in the early 1950s. His name is Dr. Muffins, named after a local boy who played drums and played guitar.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it would be impossible not to laugh at this movie. It may be difficult to find anyone who didn't adore this movie even before it was released, but if you're going to give it that much of an advantage, why not have some fun too ? It wasn't until my late 80's/early 90's that I actually picked up a tape of this movie.I'm not entirely sure how it came about, since I never bothered to read the reviews or anything prior to buying it.|0
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the loose �) did a solid job of delivering an original story that will stick with audiences for years to come. This was a really enjoyable movie. There's nothing like seeing your favourite actors playing characters whom you are familiar with. Also, this movie has a lot of acting talent from all the actors and they do an amazing job. All the scenes are well acted. I can't believe how many good performances it produced.|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
"Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but for the filmmakers, because they knew that there were other talented directors in need of their services who needed them. I was expecting this one to be an okay film from the first viewing. Then I watched the DVD, and saw that it was made by the same team that directed the best movie of the year, ""Fantasia"". It was almost like they took the same story and put it in a blender. There weren't many differences at all."|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of this?? I'm going to get all of this right, I didn't watch this show just so that I could make the point that a lot of movies and TV shows use some form of fantasy. The people in this movie do not deserve their place in history. They deserved better then where we got them. If anything they should be honored as being among the greats . This film is an absolute joke. From start to finish, there are no redeeming factors.|0
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm so glad it is finally here on DVD/Blu Ray. As you know, this movie is a parody of every one of Hollywood's most successful comedy films. If you want to have a good laugh at bad jokes then watch these movies over and over until you fall in love with all that went before your eyes. However if you just want to be entertained for two minutes then go for it.The acting is usually great but the writing is often annoying too.|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , so I'm familiar with that kind of thing."" This film is based on a book by Robert Stannard called ""The Mystery of the Gulf"", which was released in 1960. There's no doubt about it; Stannard created a riveting mystery that has lasted more than a century, but he was also an excellent writer. He wrote several suspense-thriller novels set in various locations around the world, most of them very different from Los Angeles."|0
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be called it since the whole movie is about a boy who has lost his way after losing his mother to death. It's not too bad by any means because we're supposed to follow him as he wanders all over the town trying to find himself. It starts out alright, but later on it goes off the rails and really gets ugly. I have seen movies like this before, and it doesn't help that they have so many bad actors.|0
"I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by far my favorite horror film in the 1980s and I really enjoyed this one even if it wasn't.The story is about a man that, after killing his first wife when she fell asleep, begins an affair with his second wife as well. The film doesn't seem to take much time to figure out the relationship between their husbands. That aside, the acting is very bad. I got this DVD because I'd heard something was going on called ""House of Wax""."|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to have a few drinks. When it came on the screen, I started thinking that this was one of the best movies ever made. This is a masterpiece! So far I've watched two of these but this is the first I haven't found any good stuff on IMDb, just a couple of trailers. So I had to see this... I don't even remember anything about it, except for the title. The picture is pretty bad but the story is pretty good.|0
"The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first. I mean, you can't write a better ending than this. And that's really saying something. I had one thought when I started to read this book. Maybe it was because I loved reading ""Trouble on Elm Street"" or something, but I felt like the characters' reactions were too predictable. Not only that, their reactions are very similar to some of my own. The story starts off innocuously enough and goes from bad to worse in less than 30 pages."|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar falls out of favor and the cat-lady decides he must do his best to make himself useful. The only problem? She's always been so good at taking orders. But perhaps she knows how to use them well... Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen! It was a lot like the TV show it replaced, even though there was more dialogue in it than on any of the episodes. Not only is it horribly written, its characters have no agency or personality whatsoever.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . This movie was an embarrassment to me. First of all, it was absolutely terrible acting and dialogue. The director should have just gone back to his earlier days when he was able to make even a decent-looking piece of cinema. If that were possible, why did he do this? The acting here was bad enough that I never even bothered watching it again. Second, this film was made to be seen only by those who have been following the conflict from the beginning.|0
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of friends but she likes to make friends. You'll see that after a while they start hanging out.The main thing for me to hate about this film is not how bad the sex scenes are, or even how awful the plot turns out. What i really did hate was the scriptwriter's inability to properly write female characters. He tried to make us believe that they were women-only in the past few years, but it has all been wrong. This is a mess.|0
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the owner of an illegal black-market drug trade and he uses it to blackmail his closest family members into doing his bidding. He gets them to sign over their guns, but then he takes some friends with him and shoots them dead. For a film based on a short story by Edgar Allen Poe called The Cat & the Rose (1894) it's clear that they tried really hard to make this movie be something unique.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the DVD versions so that's what I'll be talking about today. The story goes something like this: a bunch of kids (maybe 10-12) are living together in a house with only one bed. This house has been rented by two friends, both of whom think it's a very funny idea to go to a school for kids. But there is a lot of tension in the home, because each night, after the parents get up, they watch the other kids sleeping.|0
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and got some really good laughs out of the characters. That said, I found this film to be an incredibly overrated mess. There are very few people that have ever seen The Legend of Tarzan, and certainly no one who's ever heard of it. This is definitely not one of those rare examples of a film made by a small production house and released at the start of World War II (1941).|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, Lord Strathspey is able to take him up on his offer and convince him that he's too good of a speaker to fail. I don't know if there's really any truth to this claim - although I can see why it would be so popular amongst the political elite - but here's the thing: I grew up in an era when anyone could become a politician or minister. My mum had a go at it when she ran for the House of Lords.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a way you never see from him. This movie, as many others out there have written off as cheesy or bad, is really not that bad at all. It doesn't have too much to add to what I've already said below (I thought it was a little over the top for the kids). However, the storyline is a complete let down! The main character has no motivation beyond seeing his brother again after being kicked out of his home due to a drunken brawl.|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
"A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great performances by actors like Robert Downey Jnr . I don't usually like movies that I haven't seen. In this case, my initial reaction was ""Why bother?"" and to be honest, I wasn't completely sold on it at the very beginning. The script doesn't give me much to feel good about so I couldn't really get a grasp on what was going on, but once I began to dig a little deeper and see why it was so important, everything clicked."|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which the movie is presented. There are many reasons to like Chihayasu-kun as a comedy, but if there is one thing to take away from it I would say it's that while it could be fun for the whole family, it certainly isn't entertaining for anyone who doesn't have a high IQ.The first half of this movie centers around an old man named Kameki (I'm guessing he played by Takashi Terauchi ) who tries his best to convince his younger brother, Kazuichi, to become a teacher.|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Čegel, this one-act epic will take you off your feet for more than 80 minutes! It is a true triumph at the box office. It stars Robert Duvall, in a terrific performance. This is a movie that deserves to be watched on its own with no commentary. My wife and I had recently bought an Italian DVD from a store in our home town and thought: why not try something a little different. Well, we actually did just that.|0
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
"Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a shadow of a doubt one of the great, if not the greatest works of the modern medium.The movie opens with this:
I don't know why I was so turned off when it opened. I wasn't even going to watch this movie. For some reason I had absolutely no clue what it was going to look like or how it would make you feel. I mean, where did all the action and violence come from anyway?"|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but it is not an important movie.The acting by Rourke was pretty bad and his character in this movie actually seemed like a waste of time. If he hadn't had a girlfriend then I would never have thought of giving him a second chance. If you want to see a film that features a plot revolving around a guy, a dog, two cats, a man, three women…well here goes! This one is all about the cat and the man and their relationship.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one scene to another, often ending in something like `` I Don't Believe'' and then back again with a new character. But the film is all that matters. I don't think this was my first impression of this cult classic but if anyone else can give it a 2- or 3-star rating, I hope so. In the early part of the 70's, this movie came out as a box office bomb.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make me laugh, but i didn't see anything funny in it ! It was like watching a Disney cartoon with no animation ! And the story line was so stupid and contrived ! I don't want to say that I hate Disney movies because of this one (I really do), but why would they give such a stupid plot to a kid who's only interested in learning how to fly ? Maybe they shouldn't have done that ! This is simply an extremely poor movie.|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) I've seen it twice. I'm a huge fan because it's funny and has a great plot! I watched this one at the last minute with friends just because we thought it was the best episode to ever air on TV. So when I read the review on IMDb i was shocked by some comments that the movie was terrible. I have to wonder why? If you want to talk about good plots you will probably see them all on IMDb and then look them up online...|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote cabin in the woods, only to discover a series of shocking occurrences.As she makes her way into the cabin she becomes very emotional and starts crying as she gets ready to begin writing her next letter.When she finally gets inside, it turns out Susan has gone missing, leading Kate to believe she was murdered. So many times I've been tempted to write this review but have always wanted more information on this film than what I can give you at this point.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce their own material? This is a very short film, which has been done so well by its director and screenwriter that I had to watch it twice in order to remember it. It follows a serial killer and his cohorts (a group of former members of the Italian secret service) around Italy until they come to a small town inhabited by a young girl named Rosalind. The story focuses on Rosalind and her relationship with the police who are called upon to put an end to the serial killer's life.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes on a shooting rampage, but gets distracted by his wife and two daughters who are hiding in a nearby tree house. The father of the children manages to take them all into the woods and chase him off. That is when Charlie comes across a giant statue of a man made of stone standing in the middle of a field. He makes his way inside to investigate.The whole movie can't have been more boring. The plot was like a bad dream from the 1980s or so.|0
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the story of the original soldiers who escaped from a nuclear blast. I liked this movie quite a lot because there was so many interesting characters that you could root for. The only issue I had, was that the movie was too slow and not very funny at first. This movie does NOT make me laugh at all. I thought it would have been funny but it felt like it didn't belong there. There weren't any jokes. This movie just isn't funny.|0
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It may not be a classic, but it isn't awful and it doesn't take itself any seriously. It's still a beautiful movie, in that you don't get too attached to any of the main characters (who are mostly likable and well-acted), because the story just doesn't interest you. I must give credit where credit is due - I'm so sure this movie was never intended to be as serious as what it got.|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly so, from the usual fare on this list . The lead role is played by former Broadway cast member and actor/writer Joe Mantegna, who has worked in TV and movies as well as television commercials. With his trademark sardonic style, Mantegna does a masterly job at keeping us entertained throughout the movie, but still manages to leave the audience wanting more. The following review will be based on the original review which I published on May 7th 2012 (more than 20 days after its original airing).|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering'' that occurs between their two families. One can only imagine the shock and anger that such a high profile actor would face if they were caught cheating with a teenager. One wonders how long it takes for someone to say something like this on the set of an acting show, especially if you're a leading man. As I have mentioned above, however, the scene was filmed well beyond my ability to process it all.|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them involves a twist on the formula . The plot is interesting but boring. It was easy to forget about all the problems that existed in the story because of how well they were introduced. The film doesn't offer any depth to the characters, so the viewer is forced to guess which way the plot will turn. The only character who manages to hold it together is the father, although his actions aren't really relevant to the story at all.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be very funny but as I watched it I felt a little depressed. However, I still want to watch it because of its story lines. The movie was very good, especially when you see the scenes which are so realistic. But I'm not convinced that this movie will make the grade. I am a big fan of this film. A lot of reviewers seem to agree with me. So why did I keep coming back?|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with everything that they say about the plot and acting, however it's very disappointing. I never expected this movie to be good. So I'm in my late 30s and am a college professor (my degree is in public administration). My wife has recently come into my life, and was going through her divorce and remarriage. The two kids are 5 and 10 respectively, and both of them are so sweet and friendly.|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) trying to save his wife, a prostitute who has been kidnapped by a group of white thugs. I have never seen this movie until recently and while it's obviously based off one of the best books on the subject I can't imagine it being as good as all of the other greats that came out last year. It's certainly an interesting story but is far too predictable in its twists and turns to be worth your time.|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see how it would turn out. This film is very predictable, just boring enough to satisfy me (and hopefully my wife) but not so boring that we forget what the characters are up to as they move through the film. My girlfriend and I were walking through a movie theater when we came upon this movie. Her boyfriend was watching it with her at the time, and she felt bad that she wasn't watching more movies.|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i never understood how someone can play such a funny guy so evil ! you have to watch his movies ! he gets more and more annoying the closer he gets to the end of this show ! The ending was like one of those ""what's going on here"" type episodes ! You really think he is over there saving the world ? I remember watching this series with my friends when we were younger. We didn't care enough to finish it, but I'm pretty sure we enjoyed it at some point."|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well and deserves to be seen in all its glory.The only complaint I have with this film is that it does not carry the same level of emotional weight as the other releases. I was really hoping we would see a movie with some good actors like Chris Pine, Jamie Foxx, and Jennifer Lawrence. They could have brought something interesting to the table by bringing their own unique personalities into the story. Sadly, they didn't manage to pull it off.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it to someone' before. It does, however, give me hope for a future film in which the filmmakers try and recapture its sense of wonder. A little over two years ago, we started thinking about making a follow-up to an extremely well-received TV series. Unfortunately, this meant that there was no way to make any progress until 2014. We were at a loss as to what kind of movie we wanted to make - not least because none of the episodes ever made it out of the drawing board.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss . The last film I've seen from this group is The Devil Wears Prada, which I don't think I'll ever watch again. There are several things about this picture that aren't good, so let's just stick to the negatives: (1) the actors are all in their early thirties or late fifties, they don't have very much energy, and the acting is terrible, as usual with such an aging crop.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows ideas, but doesn't use them all. I don't believe there is a reason to watch this film if you haven't seen it. If you have done that, then you are in luck! I found this film to be a complete waste of time. A few things make up for it being terrible. 1. The original story lines are amazing. The only thing missing is the love story between Dr. Egon Schiele and Rose Tico. 2.|0
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,`` the movie where the father tries to have his son kill him because it's just too good. If you want to enjoy a romantic drama or a romance, then this is for you. It shows off the talent of the director (Rita Hayworth), the writing, and the direction.There's a lot going on which I've only seen in many other movies. Some moments are interesting but they're nothing special. There's not much action either.|0
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast, the movie could certainly be a big hit but I'm just disappointed that I really liked the first half. Well let's face it - this film was terrible in every sense of the word. So why bother wasting your time watching it after you've seen it so many times? You're more likely to like it if you have seen the original (this one), and even then it may not be much of a recut.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I had the pleasure of being an intern for The National Lampoon during its summer 2006 run. Since then, I've been lucky enough to spend a couple of hours with the crew every time I visit New Zealand. My wife and I recently spent two weeks in New Zealand looking for one of the great 'lost' feature films (that we thought would make a great movie) that never saw release. It turns out that this film was in the works for years prior to any of us even thinking about it.|0
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs .The main character (played by John Hurt) looks like a complete idiot. In fact, he just does everything the other guys in that movie do.He can't get along with everyone as much as he would like, even if it means breaking things. His friends are more than capable of getting along with each other, but his inability to understand them keeps him from being able to create a meaningful friendship. There were so many moments where I really felt sorry for the man who lives in this stupid world.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Gibson's, and this is probably one of his finest. The film is very well done - there is a great plot, but the acting and writing were not up to snuff. The performances were good too - although it was hard to understand some of what they were saying.The only problem I had with it is that it has a lot of repetitions throughout most of its 90 minutes. I found myself looking at the movie once and then re-watching it again to get the same idea.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if it were simply a movie. It doesn't have one of those moments where you sit back and watch something like this and think, wow, I wish someone could have given me something like that in the past instead of making this crap. The problem with this movie is that most of the acting is horrible. A lot of people are trying their best to fool the viewers and make them buy into some stupid plot twist.|0
"Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book in my second year of school I was surprised to see that there is such a large number of words in it, most of which were not on the first page. In fact quite a few of them had already been translated into English! I just finished reading ""The Art of the Kill"". It is about a serial killer's attempt to murder an American soldier in Paris during WW II by using his girlfriend as a human shield."|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that is only worth its existence when the people who make it and the people who write it don't exist ? This movie will make you want to scream for help . I've seen everything. I think most people are going to watch this movie because of how crappy it sounds, but I have never understood why anyone would put it on TV or other media at all. The dialogue is ridiculous, there's no humor whatsoever...the acting is downright awful.|0
"Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! Cute, fun, and pretty. I didn't like it, so I did it over and over for another two days. The whole premise was just a cheap knock-off of ""Good Night Kissing"" where the guy plays with his girl's tits in order to try and make out with her until she goes home. And what do you know! Her boyfriend ends up raping her on the bed! But that wasn't even bad enough."|0
"I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 but I still think she looked so young for the time! It is not surprising to find in a list of top 20 worst comedies that the number one spot is given to ""Bewitched"". That being said, while it may have fallen short of greatness in my eyes, it does feature a few good ideas. The premise is a very nice one: two characters who meet at an airport are sucked into a twisted universe where each other becomes part of the show."|0
"Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I loved every minute it took me to get back to work. I don't know about you, but I haven't found much of value in television shows these days. While I've seen a fair amount over the years with my favorite cable channel, The CW, as well as countless other channels, movies and TV shows, there really aren't very many (or even any) real ""stand-alone"" entertainment experiences out there - at least not ones worthy of your time."|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in 1989. I have no idea whether or not this was intended as part of the ""Big Three"" series, but there are too many similarities between some of their films to give me any confidence that it wasn't.The story revolves around an aging family that lives in an old mansion at the edge of town. Their two youngest children are married and the remaining four adults are widowed or separated. They live out of the main house with other members of their own family."|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read them all and none of them seemed to enjoy it in a good way . It was not hard to see why.First of all, one can understand the idea of watching a film directed by a man who is often described as a genius . But there are so many clichés with this movie. Most of them were already mentioned during the review. First of all, we have an almost total lack of any human emotion in this film . This makes it difficult for the viewer to form any thoughts.|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I can't watch him anymore. Now that this movie comes out there is no excuse!This movie may not be for the squeamish but, I would recommend it to all who are concerned about kids and their food choices. I love this movie. Even though I haven't seen most of the films released as of lately, it still keeps me very interested. This one did. It's got some great scenes between the cast and other people.|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake, this isn't a very good film; there are so many plot holes that it becomes tedious and unnecessary. I would have loved to see more of these characters as well as the story. I just hope they can make it into some kind of coherent movie someday (I really don't know how). If you're a fan of The Dark Knight Rises, you will probably enjoy this. It might be worth the wait. Oh man, i love this movie.|0
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a big movie star. He would go on to write and direct quite a few films, which were all based on characters in his comic strip. But he did not want to make these movies anymore, so he turned to Hollywood to produce them. I'm sure you can guess what the reason is, I am pretty sure there's no one else that would be willing to buy it. The story starts as a group of kids from an unknown island get trapped inside an underwater house.|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
"If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another one before. The whole movie is just wasted in the end. There is a lot to love about this movie, I mean all the things that make great horror films (the fact that you are scared when you see something and not know why). It also has a good story and some really interesting characters. All that being said, we must remember that this is a generic ""horror-movie"". I was disappointed with this movie."|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as all that. But it is fun and funny enough to keep an eye on. One of these days, I'm going to go see the new movie. It looks very promising. If you love Chucky movies, don't bother checking this one. You won't like it anyway. The best way to find out is by watching this bad ass movie. Let me tell you: it isn't funny. It's unoriginal.|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them, by giving us a story about an alien invasion on Earth. We see it from the aliens' point of view, so we don't get into any discussion of the human part. But as the film progresses, we get closer to understand some of the things they are thinking and feeling about the people they want to destroy. This gives me hope that I might actually be able to put this film away if I was ever lucky enough to work on it.|0
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' style of plot; an all out war between two competing families; violence (usually gruesome); and at least one rape scene. I am a little embarrassed to admit that I've been watching the horror movies for years now. I'm not sure whether it was my curiosity, or my inability to watch them that got me hooked. This is probably the only way to explain it. There are a few reasons why I didn't buy this movie.|0
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that my husband and I didn't like it at all, even though it was on a Friday night. It is a bit cheesy when you start to get into the plotline. The main characters (played by two guys in black trenchcoats) do nothing but talk about how they hate each other and how the rest of the world is an evil place. At one point they try to shoot each other! The story is predictable, but the acting is top notch too.|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes into an all-out frenzy as everyone gets their hands on anything that is out there and wants to have a laugh. As for the rest of the film itself it is pretty decent except for the first half hour, where you really start to think about how bad it is and why anyone would even bother watching it at such length.The story was pretty well done. The only thing I could really say about this was that the writing wasn't very interesting.|0
"The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's. This movie is pure gold. In a way, it could be a parody of ""Love & Friendship"", but not exactly. It was an all around amazing film. Not only has this movie changed my life in such a profound way that it is now one of the very best movies I've ever seen. When I saw the trailer I was like ""THIS IS A GREAT MENTOR!"" I just can't find words to express my enthusiasm for this movie."|0
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is there, even when it's not. I really loved this movie so I was ready to give it another shot, especially after watching last night's season 5 premiere. I've watched a few seasons of the show (so I know they werent going to be good) but I can't stand them anymore. This seems to be an attempt to take the show to a new level. This is about as funny as you could possibly imagine.|0
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time.The characters are very weak, some of them are really bad actors with no real character or acting ability. The film is about a war in Vietnam, which is an understandable thing to do in that it is where most of the action takes place, however, the script and the production values are lacking, even for Vietnam.The story is only loosely coherent and doesn't really develop any characters beyond the main character, who ends up being a buffoonish soldier and his two buddies.|0
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies, and usually it's either one of those two things that are easy to see.This film does nothing to advance my understanding or help me understand the film. It is completely flat. If you're someone who likes big-budget blockbusters, but doesn't find them a good enough reason to stick around in your local neighborhood (or at least isn't sure why you'd want to come here), then this movie might just be for you.|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
"Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch . I can see why she's got such a huge following. The movie is good but it's the actors (and the director) that put on one of the funniest performances in movies.I watched the movie twice and the acting was just terrible. For some reason everyone seems to be playing a ""bad girl"" and this makes it seem like they're trying so hard not to have their hair cut off."|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . While the script doesn't feel at all like it was done by anyone else, there is no effort to give anything resembling a plot or a storyline. Rather, we are treated to ""a bunch of dumb teenagers"" who have absolutely no idea why they are involved with evil people. This movie is just utter garbage. As a horror movie fan, I am not surprised. This movie had so many flaws that I couldn't really tell what was wrong with it."|0
"by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his mother and father. He's having trouble staying out of trouble because his dad was a gangster, which leads to problems in the home he shares with his mother and his ex-wife. ""I don't know any better way to tell you that my life would've turned out otherwise than to say, 'This movie can't be funny.' I don't care what you want to say -- even people who disagree with me are gonna have a good time with it."|0
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality (it was actually filmed in Bangalore) these films are one of the finest pieces of television this country has to offer.The story revolves around a boy, Ram, who has his mother's blood on his finger. The only person who could save his life from becoming the next 'Bollywood blockbuster' is Ram's girlfriend, Vika (Raniya). She seems to be having some issues with her self esteem after witnessing her husband killing an innocent man.|0
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary has done it and i am a fan of Richard Geary films.The only problem is, Richard Geary does not give you any clue how to get this movie started or what happens to the characters.And even if he do give you some hints, you have to wait atleast half an hour before the movie starts playing.You need to spend around 20-30 mins in order to get a basic idea of the plot.Some scenes are too funny for my taste but still, it is worth it.|0
"This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the only criticism that could be made was for the movie's acting, as if the director thought it would be funnier and more appealing if he replaced the people on screen with actors. There are scenes in which the actors have no clue where the plot is leading them and how to make the scene flow smoothly and realistically. They just stand around and act silly. As I've said before, I am a big fan of the ""The Lost Horizon'' films."|0
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more. I was not disappointed when the story starts off as well. A young girl is kidnapped and taken into an underground mansion by her parents, but there is another person with her. The two of them are soon able to escape and find some way back to the main world.The plot for the movie gets a bit ridiculous at points. I'm having trouble seeing what's so wrong with this movie. The premise seems like a good start.|0
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I knew what the plot was actually about. It's one of those shows that needs to be kept in your head when you watch it, but doesn't take much effort to get out of your way because you know exactly where it's headed. This one starts with an old guy getting into a pool and then gets involved in something violent, but he can't stop from running away.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
"A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in many respects, but it was not just a ""giant"" movie. The plot was extremely convoluted, which was pretty much the only reason I was watching it. The characters were very weak and the story was so stupid that you had to keep track of everything going on because you would wonder why all the other characters don't know how to answer questions. This film follows an ordinary family in the early 70's who is involved in an illegal underground drug trade."|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would make me cry, so I avoided it. Then I saw this one and fell into it with great pleasure. The plot is interesting, mostly because the main characters are young women who were abducted by aliens in the 1940's. You have to admire the actors as they try to convey how different they are from us. There's an amusing scene where a guy goes over to talk to a group of aliens while his wife is out of the shower.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The characters are well written and believable, however, I didn't care for any of the plot or character development. It seemed as though all of the dialog was directed at one person: an ex-soldier who found out that he is not actually a soldier after witnessing the death of his soldiers in a war. The film starts off pretty well, but there is so much wasted space on screen because they only had enough time to finish half of the scene!|0
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now here it's the movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie (well, not really) is that we never actually see any of the characters. They all appear in the background , and then they're either forgotten or make their way off camera after what seems like a very long time. This film is an absolute disgrace to Hollywood. The story itself is so ludicrously absurd that it is hard to believe it came out at all.|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest level with a lot of crazy plot twists . The script is amazing . In my view this is the dumbest movie i've ever seen. Why would someone put on such a lame film, I don't understand. It doesn't look any better than anything else out there. The scenery is horrendous and the character actors suck. There is no sense that people who are living in ruined cities would still have jobs and children.|0
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar brawl in the park at night. We see them walking around and doing nothing for 20 minutes only to find that they have been arrested. They are taken from the place on stretchers, but it is too late. At the police station we see a lot of people coming and going from the jail.It's like they were put on this special island to entertain the community. But what could ever bring them together?What was I expecting?I don't believe in the concept of friendship.|0
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does have one good idea, though I don't think it's particularly brilliant at this point in time. I'll start with the IMDB review. I've been watching this movie for some time and haven't seen many reviews on it. In spite of that I was pleasantly surprised to see a reviewer write a very interesting review. I'm not sure what type of fan this reviewer has, but he seems to have a strong passion for this series.|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least 10 of those 10 nights, I couldn't sleep. It took all night before I even started the next episode. I thought they were going to give it a real story line, but this was about as bad as it got....and it was just for the first two nights.I don't want to comment too much on any of the characters' personalities, since I can see where people are getting annoyed by them.|0
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over two hours, it might have been longer. At this point you would probably start wondering if it could ever be completed again. But that's not quite the case. I actually watched this early on and couldn't believe how good it ended up getting. It wasn't bad, but I'm sure most people who watched it had an issue with it. Here is my list of the flaws:1. It was filmed by a bunch of teenagers, in a school setting.|0
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments in the world. But there really wasn't much to like about this one! It had no story or characters and just plain, dull dialogue that was made more confusing by its slow-fire pace. And then there is this... I liked this show. I am an old guy who loves sci-fi/fantasy films. I do not want to spoil what you would get out of these shows but I think we will be treated to a great movie when this one is released.|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of you probably think it's boring and not very funny but for me it was one of those movies I never forget. After finishing the film, I just couldn't get it out of my mind as it had such a powerful effect on my childhood. I don't remember exactly when I saw the movie but I remember going to bed at 5am thinking this was some kind of amazing piece of filmmaking. It still amazes me how much has changed in so little time.|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Gunslinger's Walk is an interesting and quirky, but still entertaining, comedy . The premise is that a group of mercenaries are hired on a secret mission to kill President Jimmy Carter. But when one of the mercenaries dies, his body gets taken to a secret location without him realizing he is being watched by the military. First off, I'm so sorry that you're suffering from this horrible mental illness. If you can, please see a doctor.|0
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do It Better "". What's this about ? You can see them singing at the end. This seems to have happened somewhere in India where they were living and there wasn't a lot of classical music. This film isn't as bad as the rest but if you like old-fashioned comedies (like Sleepless in Seattle) you will love it. There is no humor in the story, which is very reminiscent of a movie like ""Good Morning America"".The characters are very generic and boring."|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald McBride, in a fit of anger decides that he would rather go to jail than make a movie. It is then up to his lawyer to convince him not to run. A little over a month ago, I saw the first trailer for  The Muppets 2 , a sequel to the cult classic Muppet Babies which was released nearly two years ago today. Despite having seen the first installment (which came out in 2009), I had never heard of this new film until it was recently released.|0
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need something to fill those holes, and this movie was NOT THAT. It is not a comedy, because it does NOT have a laugh line (although there is one in the background). It's always good to be reminded that you can't take your own words literally, as they will come back to haunt you. This movie has no plot whatsoever. They just keep repeating things over and over again until you are sure they don't have any idea where they are going with the story.|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film and thought it was a really fun idea to try to bring some of the music back to cinema. The movie was supposed to be made in 1974 but didn't get made. Instead, it became one of my favourites. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either. The story is basically that of a man and his son who happen to cross paths at the same time on an adventure.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' That's it. There is not a word of plot or characterization, not a clue that any of this would even make it to film. You'll never see it on Broadway. The story is as old as the stage itself. If you have read and liked my reviews for some time now then I can't blame you for wanting to purchase this collection. This book has all the characteristics of such a masterpiece.|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that should not be made.The plot consists of a pair of men and a woman who, upon learning the truth about their former life as warriors, have been separated and are living in relative isolation. It is a pity that two such great films were cut down in the course of ten years, but I am not an expert on these types of things, so I felt that I should write to one of the producers.First of all you must know that I don't give a damn about movies.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is an incredibly boring parody of teen movies and shows, with many cringe worthy scenes. The only redeeming qualities about it are the excellent acting (I'm not kidding), the good soundtrack, and the ""good kid"" jokes at the beginning. There aren't any characters or plot twists to be found in this film whatsoever, so if there's one redeeming feature that I can find it's the story. I would just like to thank the reviewers for being fair."|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could want in a horror film, but that 's how its going to go. You will never be disappointed with this film and I highly suggest you buy it. It doesn't matter if you're a newbie or someone who's had a hard time getting into movies for more than 20 years, there is something great about watching an old horror flick. There are several reasons why this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen in my life.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star and 2 ) one of her co-stars getting hit by a car while being drunk. I had no idea this show was coming out! Well, I have now been watching it for several months and I finally watched it. I like to compare myself with other people from the same geographical area in order to help me figure out what makes someone tick (I am always looking for interesting people to compare myself to, and this is an example of that).|0
"SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is silly and over the top (I say that with no malice) , the action scenes are too slow paced (which I don't understand). If you like comedy from the 1970s and 80s, you will definitely want to look out for this gem. This movie was produced by a guy who went by the name of John Belushi in the mid 90s and has directed some pretty funny films since then including ""Rocky IV"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""."|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched this film over and over again , when i went to the theaters i couldn't take myself out of it , its one of those movies where the audience is expecting a lot from you, and they are not. I have heard of this film but never had the opportunity to see it. This was my 3rd movie with Ang Lee so far and i wanted to see what he was able to pull off.|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in America in the first half of the 1800s. The movie has a huge impact on me, not because of the movie itself but because of my hatred for it.I can't say that I have never been into a movie about a black man committing an atrocity in the name of God (that is, if it had anything to do with religion). However, this one doesn't fit the mold any better than others I have encountered.|0
* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . This is definitely the most awful, repulsive piece of trash that I've come across in the last year or so. The actors do a poor job of making any sense whatsoever as they sit in their little white vans talking to each other who are all completely unimportant and unmemorable. Not to mention the plot of the whole movie is ridiculous and contrived. Why did you make a movie where a woman can't have sex when her husband insists on having sex!|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of fans were waiting outside movie theatres to find out their favourite movie was making its film debut. As far as I know, they have no idea how many people saw them. The only clue I can give is it's not there on DVD yet and I haven't found any other information online about it so far...it could well be a hit or miss kind of film at best. When you watch it like this you are probably going to want to throw money in the toilet.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives. This documentary takes a look at what it may be like to raise your own children as an alcoholic . It follows two siblings who were raised by a father whose family was of European descent. In his spare time, they played with toys on the playground, laughed together, and enjoyed life. One son was a successful business owner, while another worked in a law firm. The eldest son is now out of work and desperately trying to save money to re-entrant the workforce.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a rip off of Hollywood. I mean...what's not to love?Well, at least this is a story that actually happens! And in case you don't want to waste your money on watching a movie with just one good thing, here's a great list of what NOT to watch.If you're going to buy anything, it needs to be from a source other than someone who doesn't deserve your money.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening day and I couldn't wait for it to start. There were a number of interesting features in it that would have made up a better film, but if you look at the summary it's hard to tell where the film started and ended.I really wanted to like it. I'd read a lot of negative comments about it and was hoping someone would pick it up and make it more entertaining. Instead, I waited for it to show up on DVD so I could watch it once again.|0
"I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of what happened. In fact, the ending of the series is very interesting , so it is worth viewing. While I loved the original Star Trek I have since grown up with much more modern sci-fi television (especially those from Fox) and as a result I've watched most of them. I am quite happy to say that this is my first ""adult"" Sci-Fi show on the net and certainly not my first time watching something like this."|0
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there. This was a really disappointing film I had hoped for to be a bit of an oddity and maybe a ""good"" indie film but instead it became something much more. The movie doesn't know where to begin. First off the story is absolutely rubbish, the only real reason they even bothered going to such lengths as making this film was because it came out about a month after the release of their debut film."|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death plots ! Bizarre twists ! Lazy writing ! Bad script ! Worst director of the century ! There are far better movies to watch, but you won't hear about any of them because there are no good ones ! You can see this from the opening. One of the guys tells the others that his wife is pregnant in the next month. He says it's not due yet and then he falls asleep. The first thing I saw was this movie on DVD.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since it seems to not have that much impact. The ending is really cool and I hope it will end on a happy note for everyone involved. I always find myself getting annoyed with the acting in these kind of movies. I feel like most of these people aren't going to be too bad, but they just don't have what it takes to make a decent lead role in one of these movies. Not only that, but they don't know how to actually act.|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a total waste of life. I've been to several places, and one of the reasons that I liked it so much (as well as most other movies), was that it made me feel like I was really there...and for a brief period at least! This movie didn't get anywhere near that.The characters are generic and uninspired, and the story is just another plot device to pad out some more material for the inevitable sequel, which will be called Blind Spot II.|0
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It's not surprising that one of the three finalists won. The best part is, there was never a chance this movie would have any merit whatsoever. The director and writers just couldn't pull off anything that looked even remotely like what they were writing. I really had to sit through a lot of wasted screen time just because I needed to laugh. The fact that the actors didn't even get a chance to make a single laugh makes me feel bad for Hollywood.|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. I'm actually not sure I ever really felt a need for that kind of movie, but this film is just plain weird! It doesn't really seem to have much plot, and as soon as it does, you're left guessing what is going to happen next, because you know something awful will happen in the future, so you just keep thinking about what could have been. I mean, seriously, don't be silly with me, this movie is NOT THAT bad after all!|0
"This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are all so well drawn. I can't wait to see this next installment. But I will warn you before I watch it : ""It's about time to get out!"" A good movie, a good story, an enjoyable ride. This movie is no different. It doesn't have anything special on the inside, but at least it looks decent.I would give it four stars except for one little thing."|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really that good anyway. I can't understand why it was so hard to get a movie made in the '70's when you could go to a big box office and make a decent movie with very little money. It's hard to explain how difficult it was to do this movie from beginning to end without sounding like a school teacher saying: ``If only my kids could do this kind of thing for me, I would give them all the credit they deserve''.|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an example of what would become a common practice in many movies. For this one, I decided to follow the lead of those who say you can tell a film's true nature if you take away the ending. Here's the summary: A teenage boy and his girlfriend fall asleep during a school dance; they are awakened by their teacher who finds them drowsy and disoriented. He decides to wake them up and bring them back home, but she is too frightened to do so.|0
"It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's a good movie. I just watched it for the first time tonight on television and thought it was quite decent. This film does have its merits but, to be honest, even if you've seen all of the original films, there's not much new to get through here. If you're a Murphy fan, this isn't worth the watch.If you' ll need a bit of context about the plot, ""Murphy"", played by the excellent Richard Belzer , is a sleazy New York taxi driver."|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ) it's no surprise that few people saw this as an action movie. I don't usually judge movies for what they are, I usually see if they are entertaining, if not, why they are doing so poorly. That is not always the case in this movie. The acting in the film is bad, too many of the characters sound like they just left a bar and went home. The music is annoying, especially when there are only three or four songs in the movie.|0
"Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like a pig. This movie made me want to break down a door and run through it . I mean, really . I feel like I need to throw away this DVD as soon as possible. If only someone was able to make something that looked like this. The main reason I started watching this film was so that I could see who ""I"" am. It's not difficult to guess the role I'm playing, but I think I got it pretty easily enough."|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully original, beautifully shot play in which the viewer must choose between finding clues that will lead them to answers, and finding evidence that will bring about their salvation. It is perhaps one of the top 10 best plays ever made; not least because its message was so simple and well received by the public! It is hard to imagine that anyone could find fault with this remarkable play. The story is very moving, and the acting is superb.|0
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde to its knees in my opinion ! The script was by William Goldman and I don't think he even read the book . But they did a good job of setting things up for it . This is not the most interesting movie ever made, but if you've never seen it, you may want to have a look. The first thing I noticed before watching this film was it looked like a bad rip-off of Tootsie.|0
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it at the end of the day, while waiting for our children to go to bed. I thought this was really funny and entertaining but it kind of fell flat with me. If the script didn't have that same tone of humor then there would have been nothing to it. The plot doesn't really make sense when you think about it. Not only are they making a good movie out of what seems like a cheap rip-off, but they also ripped off several other classic movies.|0
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience as a child is rekindled as he goes on a date to Juliet's home. As the sun sets outside the house, Sayid tries to comfort him in the darkness of night. Suddenly, two strangers enter the house and disappear into a large hole. This episode was pretty terrible. I really didn't watch this one because I don't really understand why people would watch this kind of garbage. It looks like it may be the worst hour of my life.|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was involved was very disheartening. The characterizations are all completely inaccurate as far as I am concerned, the acting is also extremely unoriginal, and the fact that most of the cast members look like college kids in drag is just mind-blowing! As a lover of comedy myself, I can say without any doubt that this movie does not give me the laughs I'm used to.The writing has so much potential to really make you laugh...but unfortunately, it's totally lacking.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in an Italian seaside resort hotel during World War II, the movie was shot in about 45 minutes, and I can only say it was perfect for the time. It also features some beautiful cinematography and terrific acting. Crazy Stupid Love isn't a bad film, but that doesn't mean it will be of any use to you or anyone else who may want to see it. It is certainly no horror film, so it should not make us worry if we like it or not.|0
"My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers. He was clearly an incredibly clever, brilliant, intelligent, and wonderful human being who really could have taken the role of director at a great film company. Unfortunately, his dream never quite came to fruition. I guess it all has to do with him wanting to be ""the guy"", but he just couldn't come up with the talent or the ideas for the job. From what I understand, there is some truth in this statement."|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . It has some similarities to that book (though with a very specific setting), but nothing much else. The story is about an orphaned boy named John (played by Ben Kingsley) who becomes obsessed with his father's painting of a pirate ship in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. He also finds out that his best friend, Jack (played by Richard Chamberlain), has been kidnapped and will soon be executed for desertion.|0
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I know how it was made ) but at no point did the humor make any sense or even really make sense. The best comedy in the entire world! A few words on its title: The Great British Bakeoff takes place on a beach that is, quite literally, nothing but sand and ice. That's about what you'd think, right? Well, as you'll see below, it goes much more serious than that. Yes, this movie is incredibly long.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention and makes you feel that there is more going on than what you need to know. I am really enjoying this movie. This movie was made when I was in high school and I was excited to be the star of this movie. This movie is just not true to reality. First of all, let me start by saying my husband and I are very big supporters of children and were always excited about this film. In fact, I remember watching it in elementary school!|0
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a fun ride. If I had to do it again (I would not), I'd probably give it 5 stars. But if you're in the same boat that I was, good luck trying to find out how much more entertaining the movie is from start to finish.The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because of the fact that i found myself really bored with the movie once i got into it.|0
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series began, but with some minor changes in plot and tone. It is hard to find a film I have enjoyed in my entire life that comes out on one of these dates. This may be the worst excuse I can think of for making an excuse for such a film.The production value of this film has nothing to say about its subject matter, nor does it show much talent whatsoever. The story is very generic (it is actually a short-film).|0
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three weeks later, it was released in theatres with no explanation for why anyone could expect it to compete with 'The Rocketeer '. When I first saw the movie I thought it was good enough to make an entry in the 'Great American Horror' Hall of Shame. I was surprised to discover that many of the films were so crappy that they would easily be forgotten about by modern horror buffs.I didn't really think much of it when I saw it for the very first time.|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian cinema buffs. This is an excellent film, however I had some reservations about it. The story is about a family living in New Zealand. It was a lovely Christmas present to my son that his parents would not be visiting so he invited his uncle's wife and daughter to join him. My brother-in-law and niece were there for the occasion. They are also both actors, so they may have contributed to the success of this film!|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness ,"" and is about the American war effort from the beginning . The story centers around Colonel James ""Joey"" Browning, a young soldier who goes to Vietnam on his first combat tour with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. He is sent into Saigon as an observer for intelligence gathering. On his first night in Saigon, he falls in love with a woman whose father runs a bar. The movie begins with Colonel Jim Browning, the main protagonist of the film, sitting quietly in his tent watching television."|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a crime spree, he does it only to get into trouble with the law. This story of a little boy gets into trouble because he thinks that he can solve the world's problems by beating up bad guys. So he starts having adventures in strange places... but he ends up being killed when he falls off a high place. I hate stories like this. Maybe the worst part was watching this kid fight for life after getting shot in the stomach.|0
"Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the video below (and don't mind spoilers). ""How can we make this world a better place? By telling the truth and being honest with each other. It's pretty amazing how much information we're supposed to take in at once. If we were told everything, we'd never get through an entire day, so why do we have to know so much more about what we are supposed to say and do?"|0
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent of the Romanian government who goes undercover into a prostitution ring. There are many problems with this premise. One, no one gets hurt. It's hard to believe what happened to these women at all. Second, why do we have to take part in this disgusting activity? The main character doesn't even go to sleep. He's always awake during the day. So what if he's an agent for the Romanian government? Why does she have to be out doing something wrong?|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll get exactly what you were looking for, I know this sounds trite but in my mind it gets better. A little over twenty years ago, a team of scientists led by James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) embarked on a secret mission to uncover a series of mysterious black holes. To their surprise, when they arrive on a planet riddled with deadly radiation, they are immediately attacked by vicious beasts which appear to be human clones.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew aboard a luxury cruise liner (the Enterprise) on a secret mission to save a princess.The production values are stunning. They are good as well as impressive. There is a nice mix of space and fantasy in this production. For that matter, the special effects are fantastic. What an excellent show! This was my favorite episode of Star Trek yet. If you have the budget to pay for it, I would certainly recommend watching it.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot and killed for nothing, but I never understood why. There is no reason to think any police officer would shoot at something when they have their hand on his or her belt. This movie was really lame. The actors that were supposed to be funny were just flat out silly. You couldn't help but laugh every time the cop who was about to go to jail walked in the wrong place at the wrong time.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and there's always someone else watching who'll comment on what they think are interesting bits. While the movie is technically about a serial killer, I feel like the character in question doesn't really have any personality except his obsession with killing people (especially women). The first half hour is basically just him trying to kill people for fun, and then one of the victims takes her own life rather than be abused.|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) is simply stunning - I would have preferred a more human side to him, but you can't make this crap up! I am really not sure whether I've watched this movie before, or if it was just rehashed and re-uploaded at some point in the last couple of years from somewhere. However, I did want to check it out, because I had already watched the original, and now wanted to see if this remake was anything like the original.|0
"We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear, pain, and helplessness experienced by slaves in the U.S. During the revolution, a mob of slave owners led by the infamous ""Grand Master"" Charles Taze Russell set up plantation in the Carolinas to exploit the freedmen and turn them into slaves.In this film, which is based on true events, we are reminded of an even greater horror, one that happens to millions of Americans every single day. The only difference? It is here. This film is about freedom."|0
"I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was a very bad movie but one of my favorites at the time . This is a worse film than the first so far. First of all this movie doesn't seem like anything other than another sequel in the same vein as ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" The rest of the cast is no longer there, nor are their names anymore mentioned. The only real change is to the storyline which is almost completely different from that of the original."|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he knew thought he would make it into a hit. He could have gone to the movies and looked like that, but he chose to stay in LA. This show didn't need much work to keep people's interest. It is an odd mixture of old school hip hop and modern music with a big twist at the end. The production values and the song structure are excellent, but I never got into it too much.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say, I wasn't sure what they were going for when they picked this one up. The movie is just so poorly shot that it's a shame that we even had a chance to see it at all. I'm not sure why the production company tried to make an action thriller out of this film; the actors are average (and in the case of the main characters, forgettable) but the plot never seems to get better.|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
"I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti's best, but their acting skills are pretty good at least...
A film based on a real life event has always been a risky venture for the company behind it, as there's little guarantee that the cast and crew will make any kind of impact upon the movie or the audience. That being said, this one is quite good! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it out of the theater."|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , it is. In fact, there is only one film out of every 1,000-2,000 I have seen that really makes me question whether my mind can cope with something as ridiculous and preposterous as this. There are movies where the hero (played by Michael Palin) saves the day and does what he must to protect the village. Then there are films where the hero has to destroy the village because his wife was possessed by the Devil or some such thing.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be good, but nothing more than that. What I really appreciate are the special effects. It's an action movie. If you have never seen it, then you should at least watch it. This is not the first time they've tried to pull a Peter Pan. The premise is interesting enough, but there are other problems as well - most prominently the lack of any redeeming quality in the story itself or the acting. This is a cheap $1 popcorn movie.|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage. It just doesn't look that great. I think this could be a very nice feature to have. But I've heard better things. It was pretty hard to watch the first part of this movie, but I found myself sitting through it again and again. This film has become quite my personal favorite ever. The acting in particular is beyond atrocious. There's really only one character who deserves to be cast as such.|0
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that ends up taking them all to the edge of space. What he has no idea is that they are going to be destroyed by an alien force in the far future and that he's got to get out of there as quickly as possible. I watched this show about six months ago (it's now at 11:35 am), and I have to say it took me quite a few hours to really get into this movie, even though it was more of a sci-fi/horror movie than a family drama.|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between them are excellent, and the fact that they don't appear in this film is just a bonus. Unfortunately, I could not quite figure out why the film was so bad; it seemed like the director wanted to try something different. This movie has a horrible script, which doesn't make sense considering the amount of money at the beginning. After watching ""Hiding"" again, I decided I had heard everything."|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. In addition to being spoiled, she doesn't seem like someone who has much time for human interaction. The plot of the film follows Princess Anne as she falls head over heels in love with the beautiful young Prince John. The two are about to embark on a secret engagement that could lead them to marriage. They also want to see one another's children and take part in some family activities. However, what happens after the engagement isn't what people expected!|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
"Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been great). One thing they didn't do was take care of their cast/crew . My husband wanted to give it another shot. I tried so hard to keep him excited, but when we got home, he started singing ""I Can't Believe"" and ""I Was in Love."" After that, it was just me crying on his lap and him laughing along. The second time he stopped singing it, he said, ""You're the worst!!!"""|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull guy was a good character. I loved it but I would have preferred if they made him a man. He's so bad in the beginning he is practically a joke. This film has all the qualities of a cheap rip-off that will get more money for the director. It's not a very entertaining movie to watch at all because you're stuck watching the guys try to walk away from what looks like a dead end with their hands in the air.|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother was a big hit with children's audiences) I wondered if any of the special features might be worth watching. So here we are!! First and foremost, this is a great animated film but not an especially good one. You'll hear things that sound like they were ripped from commercials but are in fact drawn from real actors. The plot itself is pretty poor at least by the standards of 1990s animation. There isn't enough depth or humor to make up for these glaring flaws.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
"What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here's a short list, with links to some of the films that you will probably like :
1) The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (the only other film that I can think of with an average rating is ROTAR). It's one of the worst films I have ever watched in my life. The dialog isn't even close to being funny. The story is so convoluted, and the plot so ludicrous, that it made me want to throw myself onto a bed and cry for hours afterwards."|0
"I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store but now I have, I thought it might be quite a big deal. I bought it on DVD from my friend as a way to give it a chance for me to review it without him having seen it. First off, why do people care about this movie so much? The opening scene is really cool, but the rest of it is awful and totally annoying. It starts out with a kid sitting in front of his TV talking about some ""festival"" that will take place tomorrow."|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name does not seem all that funny to a lot of us Indians. The fact that India is often depicted as a harsh place is very odd indeed. In this movie everyone is trying to look cool and are acting pretty bad. I had to stop myself from laughing out loud because I have no sense of humor. There's nothing remotely funny about it, at least not until you've spent some time in India.|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most people didn't find it interesting or engaging enough to be able to get through the entire film. However, after watching it several times, I have developed a sort of affinity for what makes it interesting (in my opinion) and why people would pick it up. First off let me say I am in no way a fan of James Franco. Not because he is a good actor, but mainly because I think his character is so shallow that there's not really much to do with the guy.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz is a big fan of John Lennon's ""Imagine."" In the end, if you haven't already heard it, I recommend listening to all three minutes. You should also see this movie as a companion to one of Ted Sallis ' films. The fact that we are seeing these things for real speaks volumes about the depth and importance of the subject. I just came back from a meeting with Mr. Corelli at the Academy Awards."|0
"The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . I have to say that, although there are some minor differences, this movie really does not feel ""authentic"", it's too far removed from what makes up the other movies in the series. It also feels very out of touch with the genre, which was so well represented in recent films such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Deadpool 2 . ""Frozen"" is based on the best-selling children's novel by Michael J. Sullivan."|0
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following, because I was one of those who liked it when I saw it at the movie theater. But when I watched it, I couldn't figure out how to proceed without taking out my camera phone and trying to take photos. The plot is boring and the acting is awful (if I can even call it that) but the picture quality is OK.The first time I saw this movie I didn't think it was interesting enough to justify spending money on it.Now I'm glad I watched it.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid with no background or knowledge of comic strip animation was trying to make out, and there's no reason why he should. Why do you even bother going to see this? First of all it is based on a children's book that has no relevance to its plot. And secondly, the movie itself is actually so boring that most of your time will be spent laughing and looking for more things to laugh about instead of enjoying it.|0
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I was extremely disappointed with the direction, editing and writing skills used in this film. I am so sorry that many people find this movie very offensive. There is no place for this type of thing at all in an art class. It makes me angry. I will watch this movie again and again because I want to destroy anyone who tries to write about it. I can't wait for it to start again. And I hope one of my brothers gets killed over this nonsense.|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
"This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us inside the mind of Dr. Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" universe. I've done a lot of reading lately, but mostly about religion and politics. I have to admit, I didn't want to start with this movie: It's not very interesting. It's full of clichés, as you may notice from the opening scene. We don't see any alien races. We don't know any names of people or animals. There are so many things I dislike about movies like this."|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall i don't have much to compare it to. However i must say that i liked it the most out of those three movies I saw last year! I've always had a deep interest in mythology, fantasy, science fiction, religious themes, mythological figures etc. I was born in the 1950's, so I'm not exactly old enough to appreciate this subject, but I do remember the first time I heard of this film.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time! I've always found it funny that so many people don't like horror films because there isn't enough gore and dismemberment. What I really enjoy though, especially if you can get past the awful acting (as I usually do), is all the hilarious dialogue between the various characters. This movie has some great writing and the acting is spot on. This film is not easy to recommend to non-horror fiends.|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video clips, interviews etc. I love watching this as i like to read lots of articles from time to time. This show should have been cancelled many years ago but the cable company decided that it wasn't worth it anymore. They also made sure that no new episodes were being made. What a great show! There are a lot of things going wrong with the plot and its characters...the acting sucks, there is so little chemistry between any of the characters, and the entire series is incredibly pointless.|0
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind . . . and I'm not sure what more we could ask for from an entertainment experience that is so mind-blowing.'' At first glance this little film has a pretty solid story behind it. At the end of the day, it doesn't. But to be honest, I thought it was a really good idea at first. This movie didn't live up to how I had envisioned it in my mind. In fact, I think it may have turned out worse than I originally expected.|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things that were not so nice. The story here is quite good, though it doesn't always follow the plot and it often seems like they have a plan in mind before everything goes wrong. The only redeeming factor for me was that I got to watch the film in its entirety for the first time as I'm getting old. I think it was important that the plot remained consistent, as there were many scenes that could have been edited out.|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
"I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen all of the trailers for it. It looks like something that someone would put together to raise money for charity. If you've never seen it or are curious, I suggest you rent it from your local video store.If you've not seen it, here's some information about it:It was released in 1980 as ""The Last Temptation of Christ"". After a couple of mediocre movies, it started to become a cult classic after the release of its first remake."|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more recent The Dark Crystal. It was filmed in a very primitive state, mostly in black and white, except for occasional flashbacks to the 1930's. This is possibly the only film where Chaplin plays an old school cop who makes it back to modern day Los Angeles. The acting is fine, the cinematography is rather dull, but the story is compelling.I've had this picture before, and thought I would see if there was anything to say about it.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must say that I do not think this movie is bad, however, for some reason. The script is very well thought out, but it is a lot of repetitiveness to make you sit through several scenes. In my opinion, the whole movie is just a bunch of wasted time. It seems as though the main character will never get anywhere because he's stupid enough to walk right into the wrong people's lives.This movie may be funny and entertaining, but it fails miserably at delivering its message.|0
"This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . While there are some flaws in the way the anime is done , it is still quite entertaining! The story of ""Himeko no Rave"" is pretty basic. A girl named Himeko has to get out of highschool before she hits her late 30's (or younger). She tries to leave home but ends up getting a job at a fast food chain. She does not like it and doesn't like her boss' attitude."|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind. When I was 11 the show was cancelled, and I sat through it all again this past summer. There are sooooo many amazing things going on in there that it was impossible not to love it.The story is about a couple of space explorers who travel from planet to planet to explore alien life, which turns out to consist of almost everything we're used to living on earth. They meet an extraterrestrial woman and they form an impassioned friendship. This movie is really boring.|0
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite being told he could not ? I just went to see this movie when I came to India in the winter. It wasn't too bad. There was very little action though and there wasn't much romance either. At least that is what I was told from the film's producers but it was really boring to watch. The only thing I would have liked about it was if they had taken some time to include a decent story line. It didn't.|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
"What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned into it early in the evening because I love comedy. Not only is it funny but also it makes me feel good. This is basically what you get if you don't like movies about animals, or at least the people who put them in there. ""Killer Cow"" is nothing more than a horrible excuse for human emotion. As a man of few words, I have little sympathy towards him. But to be honest, the film lacks any kind of humor or heart."|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially since it has nothing to do with porn or the arts, then watch it. The main thing that you see in this movie (at least the first few scenes) is that a guy does some dumbass shit while his wife is there watching from the sidelines. The second time she comes back and finds out what's wrong he gets so mad at her for ruining his life and she goes home to tell him how awful he was . I really don't care about this movie.|0
"The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , because I have seen quite a few of them (I'm a sucker for gore), but I never thought I'd say: ""this is a good horror flick"".SCREAM is one of those films where the film itself is just as interesting as the characters. Every scene in SCREAM is so bizarre and horrible that it was enough to make me fall asleep. If you're looking for a movie that's a mix of both genre and story, SCREAM might be an intriguing prospect."|0
"I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very funny to watch, which is always nice. I loved this movie! The story was really cool, but I hated some of the acting. At times it got a bit boring and the characters were pretty predictable. If you're going to make a ""comedy"" with comedy at its centre (and if you're making a comedy), you might as well have an actor who doesn't care what people think."|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , but not great. I enjoyed it. I did not believe in it. There is nothing particularly new or original about this story. It just looks old fashioned. If the story were better, it could have been funny. If it were better... that would have been the same for me.If you are interested in learning about some of the problems associated with having children and how society can be made to take care of a parent/caregiver problem, this movie might be worth watching.|0
"I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've wanted to get into the directorial arena, his films have always impressed me with their ability to create an amazing world. In the first film ""La Morte d'Arthur"", we've got Arthur (Jean Valjean), a young boy who wanders through the land trying to understand the nature of evil. But he soon finds out that what is evil lies far more subtle than he ever imagined. While investigating one of these dark places, Arthur comes across another man who was once a prisoner of fate."|0
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
"The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only has 6 hours of running time and doesn't show much of the plot. However, the movie is very funny as well. While there are many good jokes in this movie it also contains some fairly bad ones at times. As you may have read I mentioned several times before that I hated ""Aristorcats"" and had been doing so since I watched it about a year or so ago. This is the second part of a series of interviews I conducted for a DVD/Blu-Ray that will be coming out in November."|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary film. This film is based on an original story by Howard Hughes, published in 1980. Hughes had never heard of The Island of Doctor Moreau while making this film for a magazine called Science World. It was very difficult for the editors to decide whether or not they wanted to publish it in print, and they didn't know which one to go with, so they stuck to their guns. When they did pick up the book they went straight to the end and threw away half of the first edition.|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be the fact that it wasn't aired in America, where the show has been successful. There were other shows on the network with better and more interesting characters (i.e. Friends & Family). I'm going to start this review by stating that if you don't mind me saying this much, I am a really bad person. I can't even begin to describe how incredibly disappointed I felt when I watched the pilot for this episode.|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
"Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona has been a caricature of himself for many years. But after seeing him in The Night Manager , my first thought was, What the f**k is he doing? ""I don't care about any of it. I hate that this movie even exists at all. I just found it very disturbing to see a guy who should know better spend so much time making people look dumb. That's the end of me."" I love Kevin Spacey."|0
"Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This was one of the movies I thought were bad but they are pretty good. There were a couple of really horrible scenes in this movie but when you're looking forward to watching it you'll be glad you did. The cast is actually quite decent. Peter Serafini does some really nice lines as the head of a small criminal organization called the ""The Brotherhood"". But, what really gets me excited is the supporting cast that also appears in the movie: Tom Selleck and Robert Downey Jr."|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
"Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock star Elvis Presley. It's also, of course, one of the most famous movies ever made, which makes us wonder: how did you guys get such a great script, so bad acting and so little story? A few minutes before the opening shot of Elvis Presley's ""You Can't Stop The Music"" plays, we get a couple of glimpses into his life from his early days with his mother, Aunt Marlene."|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it was made. There are several scenes where you feel there is something really wrong with the actor who played the lead, especially in certain parts. Also, the pacing is just awful. I'm a huge fan of this movie and would like to see it released. The casting is very bad and the script is extremely dated. So let's face it: don't put this movie on your shelf; you will never see it again!|0
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had an all star cast including the likes of Fred Savage, Marge Simpson, Tim Allen, Peter Fonda and Al Pacino. The episode ended with a big bang as Homer falls asleep in front of the fireplace to the soundtrack of Santa Claus making his merry-go-round . This was one of my favorite Christmas specials of all time but I must say that I found it kind of repetitive. Most of the episodes were centered around family and friendship, and there was no real need for plot development.|0
"I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say this was a poor effort. The acting was very amateurish and there were too many silly characters that just seemed like they were supposed to be amusing at the expense of the story. This could've easily been worse. It was directed by John Singleton and stars Tom Hanks as a ""bad ass"" ex-policeman (who now works as an actor) named Frank. Frank is a hard working cop who has lived a pretty decent life without being able to help his daughter who is mentally ill."|0
"The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. In the background you'll hear the announcer, ""Buddy Holly is here."" It's one thing to see someone who is famous as a song-and-dance number singer doing something new with it. But it can be very disheartening to watch somebody who is so dedicated to his craft being cast as the main character of a movie that just happens to be about him. So I was really excited to see this when it comes out at the end of July."|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to being subjected to it. The problem here is that these kids have all the acting chops of an old school American football player (who probably would have been able to score a kick or two) and just can't get anywhere near what they're doing. The director makes them go to bed, sleep, take a walk on the beach, lie down, etc. And he says: ""What? What's wrong with them?"""|0
"It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY/NJ era of rock & roll. In fact, if someone ever wrote a song called ""I Got You"" about this band, I wouldn't let them get away with it.The only thing I'm not surprised by is how quickly this song became popular in the 90's, considering it was written in 1977. It also doesn't make sense that the group would have released this song while they were going through a bad bit of a financial mess and trying to recover some momentum."|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar . She is the most beautiful thing on the planet. I just want to tell everyone they will never be sorry, because if I were you I would hate it. What an overacting performance by Julie Newmar here, she seems to really believe she's getting away with everything she's saying and doing. You can't blame them for that; it's exactly like having a bad day at work, but worse than that, you don't go to the movies anymore.|0
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , they are not significant to what is actually being said, and it is impossible to believe that the author believes he is giving an accurate account.First of all, this movie is a complete waste of $13 million dollars. Why? There are some parts in this movie that were really impressive (the action scene, for example ) but other parts have nothing interesting about them at all. What happened to the director's eye for direction? Where is the acting?|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network. I've been looking for my home movies since they were on HBO back in the day. You know, when you go to see something, you can tell why it's not like the original. For example, one of the movie directors was so bad, he had to change all the words in the movie. And this movie is just terrible. The plot doesn't even make sense. This movie has a lot of flaws.First off there's the characters.|0
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The main character of this movie does nothing more than get high on something, make some stupid joke, and then disappear. The ending is a little predictable but the overall quality is very good. The only negative I can say about this movie was that it seemed like everyone who had seen it would love it. I don't know how people are going to go into a movie with no expectations and expect everything to work out so beautifully.|0
"My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect wife in Paris. The plot is somewhat predictable, but there are so many moving parts that it's not long before everyone onscreen has to ask themselves, ""How did this end up where it did?"" This movie is terrible. The acting is average at best. There is little to no chemistry between the two lead actors (even though it's one of the worst roles I've ever seen). The writing is laughable and the premise is as dumb as the opening credits."|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what I was hoping for from the first film. The movie isn't all that good (for example, the cast is pretty average). But it's a must-see for the horror aficionado. I am so annoyed by every single movie I see these days, and this one has no redeeming feature. Not only does it not appeal to a younger audience, it fails utterly. You know, if they were young, they wouldn't waste their time watching this garbage.|0
Dr. Paul Flanner ( Richard Gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son dies and he begins to feel isolated. A group of young doctors who have an interest in the story are invited to spend some time with him at his practice. While I love this movie (and am pretty sure you can't say that about most movies by anyone), I must point out that there are plenty of other things that could make this better. One problem is that the doctor, as portrayed here, is not really a scientist.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling that follows . The last couple minutes of the movie seem like it was written in one sitting. It feels like you're walking into a time machine where all these events took place . There is nothing wrong with it but it lacks the depth of imagination needed to bring something new to the screen. I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If it made me feel better, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Just don't rent it!|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've watched this movie countless times, it's become quite obvious that what was originally meant as a satire is far more sophisticated in concept than the film itself. The characters are very simplistic in their characterizations, making the most out of the screen time given them by the director. One of the reasons I can't give this a 10 is the lack of humor. There isn't one to be found. I'm so glad that I read the reviews on IMDb.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it with my friend and his wife. It's about a woman who goes on a very violent crime spree which is captured on film. However, her friends manage to turn out to be just as vicious. I will admit to not knowing much about British cinema when I first came to the UK but after finishing the film I felt that this was perhaps one of the best films I'd seen for quite some time. The plot has no redeeming qualities and the characters are completely unlikable.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , this movie just blew my mind. This is one of the great comedies I've ever seen, full of all kinds of crazy and stupid stuff (I'm trying to avoid being silly by making jokes that might make you cringe).The story is very funny, even though it doesn't really have much plot. This movie can't be called bad for what it's not good for; The acting. It looks horrible. There is absolutely no chemistry in the film whatsoever.|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . There's a reason why I got my hopes up :).The only thing that surprised me was the acting, because of course, most of the characters are just average actors who have never done anything memorable. But it was funny enough to keep your interest till the last few minutes.Overall, I would definitely rate it a 5 out of 10 ! What is so terrible about this movie ? Is it that it's very cheesy ? Is it the story? Or the script ?|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do have to admit though, this was a bit of an overkill. Maybe if I had just been able to look at it through a lens of my own, I might have come to enjoy it more for the sheer entertainment value it provided. The movie starts out as a typical Hollywood action flick. It takes place in Vietnam where the Marines and Americans are getting ready for Operation Overlord. The movie is set in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . It has great acting, plot twists and a very nice storyline. But it was never actually good, it only made me look forward to the next thing that came along! I have found this to be one of the rarest and least appreciated books in America. I read it while driving my friend through town. Once he finished reading the story, we went home to watch TV. What a pleasant surprise! !|0
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
"This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it, but at that time I was just a kid. It was funny to see an actor of his talents who had never been in serious movies put on the screen by someone who could have made a more realistic story. The plot is fairly simplistic and doesn't go too deep into the dark underbelly of the underworld. There is no suspense, no danger, no intrigue, and only one good character. If you're looking for something ""bad"", this is not it."|0
"The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay TV show if you're really desperate for something good to do, not so much if you're just looking for mindless fun. However, the way I've always interpreted it (though I have not watched all the episodes, and I don't plan to at least) is this:


There is a film that everyone knows about called Bride Of Chucky . It was released around 1980-1981. The story revolves around two women who go on vacation together."|0
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about the worst of them. But there was something so terribly wrong about this film, that I almost missed it because it seemed so far removed from what we saw in Brazil. I didn't think it was good but I'm glad I didn't watch it. My only regret is having not paid $10 for this. It was a waste of money to waste it. The acting was terrible and most of the writing was stupid. The main character was very predictable.|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how they can create such a huge difference between their characters that it would be so difficult to tell who is truly the villain. This is one of the least interesting movies on IMDb.It starts off innocently enough. An Indian man and his daughter try to go camping with friends (one of them being a famous rock band). The parents decide to visit an Indian resort. What happens? One day, when they arrive there, they are greeted by a group of women wearing black outfits which are very revealing.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is one of the most annoying characters ive ever seen on TV and I cant remember anything else bad about him other than having a really long voice. My only real gripe was that the writers chose this guy as their lead, they should have just let him do whatever he wanted. It would have been better if they could have shown him trying to make out with a girl. There's lots of great shows in existence, but what makes them stand out is that they aren't scripted or directed by anyone.|0
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for second ), is actually very good but, it's not really a drama as such. It's more like a thriller that you would see on a daytime TV show. What do you think of this film? I have heard about this before but didn't realize it was coming out and had been waiting until it was over. This movie seems to lack an ounce of charm or anything that could stand up to serious scrutiny.|0
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes I could barely hold it together, I was literally shaking. The whole time I just sat there thinking what the heck is going on with this dude ? What can I say that hasn't already been said by many others . I really hate this type of movie, because all the plot points don't add anything to the movie or the story whatsoever. If you want to get a taste of how stupid movies can be, check out this one.|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values are all superb . You can't believe how good these movies are. I watched them a few months after they went out on the market. I still have some hard feelings towards them. They were my favorite films when I was a kid but now that I've got more experience watching movies it's become obvious that I don't love them as much anymore. The movie opens in an empty apartment complex where a bunch of teenagers hang out at night.|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
"A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not, the people watching the movie did not have a bad opinion of it . When you look at films from the 60's and 70's, you find that the movies made in those eras were more entertaining. I remember when I was a kid watching ""The Rocky Horror Show"" I couldn't understand how anyone could go about doing that kind of act. Even if you didn't want to know what the Rocky Horror Act was , you might just be able to guess."|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers who are trying to get in a car and shoot at each other in a crowded parking lot. But I thought that, for once, the director was doing something unusual: he didn't take it too seriously. After all, there has been a whole genre of films made about such things in recent years, called ""The Bewitched"" series. I'm not sure what inspired the name. I saw The Blair Witch Project , and I was blown away."|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him over the head with its windshield, then drags him across the road and into a ditch. He has to jump back into his bike as the car drives away before he can be saved. I got this book for Christmas last year at my local library that I usually skip reading, but I wanted to give it another chance since I've always been a big movie buff. Unfortunately, the reviews were much worse than usual, so I gave up.|0
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save a bunch of people from a shark attack, but were unable to because of sharks that got into the boat. Wow this movie just destroyed me. If I could give one negative review about this movie it would be the ending. The reason why I say this is because there really isn't much else going on besides what's happening in the main storyline. We didn't really get any time to explore the city as well. There wasn't much story and character development.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you will know what this character was like and others won't . Here is the summary from Wikipedia : ""Sugar Ray Leonard (or Sugar Ray), a former policeman who became an assistant cop for the LAPD. Sugar Ray has a problem with his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Love Hewitt. She makes a deal with a drug dealer that Sugar Ray will kill anyone who comes after her, so that she can move in with the mother of her daughter."|0
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every woman in the world at your beck and call, etc. I could probably watch this over and over with no problems, as long as my wife was able to make me watch it all night. This film does not disappoint! I love the idea behind it, so I was glad that it came together on its own. However, I found the story line to be poorly executed. The characters weren't particularly likable either.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
"Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be able to create something special for this film.This movie is more than funny. It's one of those movies that people think is good but if you look behind the screen it can be extremely depressing at times.I found myself laughing my head off watching these characters get killed by each other from so many angles. If you've never seen ""Taken"" there are plenty of things to dislike about it. First off, the premise of this film is not very original."|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I'm not sure why this was taken out, since it made a great impression on me with its portrayal of the characters and the story line. The script is nothing spectacular, or even good in terms of plot development. This film is actually a very bad adaptation of a really popular comic-book movie. And that's kind of like saying that The Godfather is a better remake of Scarface than it is a more realistic one. It just doesn't work.|0
"This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times. The characters were so relatable even if you weren't really there for the story.I'm a little disappointed in this film being called ""a comedy"". It's hard to believe that a comedy was made about a woman trying to have an affair with a dog and her boyfriend/husband (who she had sex with before they dated). I just got off work this morning and wanted to sit down for a while and review something I recently completed."|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was expecting a dark comedy, but it got to that. The story was predictable in every way. There's nothing really interesting or shocking about this movie whatsoever. I did not expect to be so disappointed with this movie. So much of the humor comes off as stupid, and the ending is also quite predictable, but the story itself makes up for any dumbed-down direction. If you are looking for an entertaining movie to sit on the couch with, then give this movie a miss.|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the ball rolling. While Chaplin has been able to make movies that are fun and entertaining in their own right, there is no way to know how this one would have been received if he hadn't gotten it off the ground. It's almost impossible to imagine that any American would have seen this movie and thought it was worthy of an award. I feel bad for those who were disappointed after seeing it, but I can understand why they gave up and let it fade away from view.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had the worst experience I have ever had with a movie. It was so long, he had to sit through two or three hours of it! The ending was lame and we were not given any hints as to what is going on at the beginning of the film. What kind of movie does that. I really did not know much about this film till my husband bought it on DVD for his birthday. I don't know how he ended up seeing it, but it's pretty funny.|0
"I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction was top-notch. It's been almost ten years since I last watched ""The Girl with All the Gifts,"" and I haven't seen it in more than an hour. It's not really important to me, but here are some things I wish I had known when I first saw the film that would have allowed me to see it as a completely new experience: First, the movie looks absolutely terrible. Not good enough to be worth watching, yet not worse than my other recent films."|0
"That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is because it made me think of another film that I recently watched. There are some very interesting ideas in this film, but I found myself having trouble coming away with a good opinion of it. I'm not sure what the writer/director was hoping to achieve with this film, but there were some really cool ideas thrown in. The most obvious of these would be ""you're not alone"", which sounds great if you already have a friend or two who share your feelings about the world around them."|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you are a fan of Hitchcock movies and want to see him back in action it is worth your time. The acting was good as well . If you like dark, noir type horror movies you must watch this film. You'll be surprised at how much suspense you'll feel waiting for the twist ending! It's actually kind of entertaining when the twists happen; but what really impresses me about this movie is how they manage to take you out of the movie so completely.|0
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 4 was also good but that movie was directed by John Carpenter and written by Stephen King. So what did I get for Christmas?A crappy film with no plot or story, which was supposed to be a comedy, about a group of people who just happen to have some kind of psychic ability (I think). They decide to live on a cruise ship during a plague and try to save each others lives.|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and one that has been heavily hyped by people who aren't familiar with the genre or history of the film, it's really a great movie (especially in the original Spanish version).The writing is excellent, though I do not have much to say about it. Although I thought it was actually a fairly good piece, I don't think I really found myself ""in love"" with it. I was very surprised to discover how far away from the source material David Lynch came on this project."|0
"What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and all of those involved with it. The acting is very good and I am amazed at how little time went into every scene. I have not seen this film yet, but was looking forward to getting the chance to see it. But alas, it wasn't that great. I did enjoy some of the best parts of it (for example, the beginning of ""The Big One""), but it really couldn't hold up to its own high-level expectations."|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was just a young kid with no memory of it being seen. So I thought I'd see if I remembered anything about this movie. I remember the opening sequence having me in a very strange situation, where the main character comes out from the back of a plane into a field that looks nothing like what it should look like. What I can only guess at is that this scene is actually supposed to have been filmed in the desert somewhere.|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and that's only the first 1 hour of the film!). It starts at 3:30am local time and ends around 5:30am. There are a lot of explosions but it was really hard to see anything other than a bunch of people running in the streets. I'm not normally into horror but this was so far from my expectations. This movie has absolutely nothing in common with movies like ""Voltage"" or ""The House That Dreaded Halloween""."|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
"My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was so funny. But wait , there is more! This is one of my top three shows of all-time. It started out with the same cast in a completely different setting. The premise was pretty simple, as it was just about a couple of people having some fun. However, once they got going, everything went downhill fast. One might say that the ""fun"" really wasn't much to begin with since they couldn't make even an ounce of their acting work."|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
"At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better.I never thought I would love the music of this film! I have only seen this movie a couple times but i am very impressed by this film. The production values are amazing and the acting is great. The story is very cool and makes no sense at all.The only problem i have with this film is that some parts were not written to be taken seriously. As someone else said, ""This movie does not need to be told in order for us to enjoy it""."|0
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to two songs a week, they really should have played at least some of that film on tape. It would have been much more interesting were the Monkees not playing this stupid movie all the way through. I mean, the music and sound effects are so awful (or so annoying) that most of the time I'm unable to even watch the movie in question.The plot is boring. The ""movie"" doesn't make sense because there is no real plot."|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that the film was set in London during the 1920's, which is very interesting. I don't know where the writer or director gets her information but it is a fantastic story. I can't wait to see the next episode. Although I've never seen this film, I'm pretty sure I'll like it - there just isn't anything else quite like it in the US, so I'm willing to believe that someone has made a good effort.|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps you interested even after seeing the opening scene. I really didn't like this movie. I mean, let's just say, I enjoyed it from the get go. What did I like? Well: 1. It was quite a bit lighter than the previous two movies. 2. The character development was rather good in this one. And 3. I think most people who came here for this film were probably pleasantly surprised with the direction.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing', which is kind of funny because I had been hoping it wouldn't be a great film since I saw it in high school (it's not much of a romantic comedy). It's about a gay guy who meets his lover on an intermission at the theatre. I can't explain why, but when i first saw the movie my heart started racing. The director and producer were very good at making sure the story seemed plausible and believable.|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I can only think of one thing that made it worth watching! This movie has been around for many years...I thought it was amazing. I watched it while in college, and loved it at its best. Unfortunately, my friend's daughter gave this film a shot, and she loved it more than I ever had. Now, about five years later, I'm just glad I didn't spend any money on it again.|0
"This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for documentary filmmakers. What makes this one so amazing is the ability to create a compelling, entertaining, and in some cases, humorous story with no hard facts whatsoever. ""Holly's greatest accomplishment as a filmmaker was to convince me that there is more to life than just the beauty of an apple. And if I'm not wrong about that statement, I'd like to believe that he did his research when he chose this subject matter."|0
"This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , the only other film I have seen that ever had more than 30 minutes of screen time prior to its end was an earlier MGM production titled ""I Have a Dream"" . This film has no redeeming value.The original script was terrible. The actors seemed to have been re-recruited to play the same roles again and again (except for Paul Reiser) with very different effects. The acting was simply atrocious, as was the script itself."|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch this crap in college and now I can't sleep at night knowing what the fuck is wrong with you guys.I just got home from work recently and I have a copy of this DVD on my drive so I decided to see what could possibly go wrong. I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and was immediately intrigued as to if it might be good, but I found myself completely unable to grasp the message at the end.|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with the intention of finding his next girlfriend . I can't believe I haven't seen this movie since it came out just a couple of weeks ago! It's not bad, but when I first saw it I expected to have an awful time getting into it. However, after watching the trailer and thinking it over I'm glad I went ahead and did so.The main thing you notice about this movie is the fact that Garlin's characters are all extremely stereotyped.|0
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about a story of a boy and his mother. My initial thought was that there was nothing about it that would appeal to me. The film starts off with a very cute young boy's father going out to a party. This movie is pretty bad. Not because it's bad, but because it's an extremely boring movie. Every scene looks like you're looking at photos on the Internet for the first time. It never gets any suspense from anything it says.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down on the internet and it does indeed have some of the plot points that we've seen. The characters are great, you just wish they were more in character.The acting is bad. It's not all bad though, as with the actors who play the main characters, their performances are above-average.This movie is actually good. Not because it was well written, nor because it was fun to watch. It would have been a hit had it been made into a movie!|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in and out of everyday scenes as it is. Unfortunately, the storyline did not provide enough plot to keep me reading for more than a few minutes at a time (which could have been avoided if the script had given any hint as to exactly what the plot would be in the movie, rather than making it difficult for me to follow). If you're new to The Walking Dead series, then I recommend watching this.|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in over their heads and decide to murder each other's wives. This is an extremely odd story, but I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to write it.The only reason I didn't go in expecting this was because you never know when you're going to find a good bit of violence and suspense. A movie that doesn't try hard to make anything interesting at times.It's a typical low budget, low production value film where the actors have no control over how they look or move.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an ex-girlfriend who finds herself in a world that's as dangerous as it is lonely. And I mean REALLY dangerous. What can you tell me about what went down when they came up with this idea? Is it just some sort of ridiculous plot line or have they gone back to the drawing board? This movie was supposed to be a remake of the film ""In the Dark"" but they couldn't find a way to adapt that script so now we get something completely new."|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the anti-imperialist movement after WWII. The story centers on his childhood and education as a boy during the 1930's, during which he studied classical poetry at Kyoto University, where he also received a degree in composition. Miyazawa was influenced by early German writers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Robert Schumann (in the same vein as Hölderlin).In this short film, Miyazawa portrays a ""normal"" life for him and his friends, except for one strange event."|0
"The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a hard time enjoying anything else the movie makes you watch. ""There is something of a theme in this film that is really difficult to understand: it isn't about one thing but two or three things, and they both seem to conflict for our attention. I can see how it could be frustrating for the viewer, given that he or she has to wait several minutes to hear what each one of them has to say, especially if they don't all sound the same."|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched for this movie over and over again. So today I found it. And boy did I have to hate it. First off the story is just plain crazy. I was a little upset that I missed out on one of the most popular movies of all time, so I decided to watch it again. However, I still had no idea where the heck they were getting their information from. The movie didn't contain any plot twists nor did there ever be any.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a certain type of character is extremely rare. What makes these movies so special is that they took place in an absolutely different world than ours, one that wasn't entirely as well developed but still held its own as far as acting goes. What I liked about this film was the ability to get some very interesting dialogue without spoiling anything. There's just enough to be able to enjoy the movie, but not enough to leave you crying your eyes out.|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
"This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families in order to travel to Africa, where the natives are no more. When the men finally arrive they find themselves suddenly face with a choice: live in poverty while being treated poorly or seek freedom as a ""free man."" The cast is extremely talented and this flick has an almost surrealistic quality that's difficult to put into words. I have watched hundreds of hours of black movies over the course of many years so it's hard to understand how this one managed to slip through the cracks."|0
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but it seems like it could've been a little more direct than that. There is a scene where a car crashes into two other vehicles and they are separated, and as one of them gets back on its feet and drives away from the other it falls in the middle of a field, killing all four people on it. Well I am going to say it, I watched this last week and was shocked at what happened to me.I don't think anyone saw this coming.|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man who runs away from home, where he gets lost in a town filled with supernatural monsters.He ends up on a deserted island with a group of teenagers. He soon finds himself being kidnapped by some bad guys. He tries to warn them of his impending fate, but they ignore him. One of the worst things I've ever seen or experienced. The actors were absolutely terrible.The story line was so nonsensical that it felt almost like they were attempting to cram all of these characters into one movie.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (both of which are just as weird). But, what I found to be a bit of a problem with this film was its lack of substance. The acting was not up to par, it had a plot that left me wondering where it would take the rest of the movie, the pacing was uninspired at times, and the script felt like an afterthought thrown together by the cast in order to make the movie seem funnier.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
"No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave a glowing review of my latest film, ""Pulp Fiction"". In that piece he praised the quality of his work. The worst movie in years. If you have been a fan of the Dark Knight Rises series, you are probably already aware of the atrocious performance by Heath Ledger (played by Heath Ledger), but if you're not, please go back and check this movie out: http://www.filmsurprise.com/watch/the-dark-knight-revolutions/ It has no plot whatsoever, yet it sells tickets and rakes in millions."|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact their last album, ""God's Not Dead"" is arguably one of the most popular Sabbath albums of all time. I don't know much about these bands. My father used to watch them but he was always very picky when it came to television shows/films. We only saw them on the BBC because my sister liked them and wanted to watch them so we watched them while she watched other programs. But I guess those were the days in the 90s!"|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) . But when i started to work on my own screenplay and saw this movie about some old woman in a cabin, i decided to get myself involved. Well, first of all, yes, i'm a fan of classic movies and i have watched the original ""The House with No Door"" just like many other fans do. When i heard the story about the guy that was supposed to be the main character of the film, I wasn't really familiar with him."|0
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin's film, which is one of the greatest ever made (and I'm quite a big fan of this film), Humphrey Bogart has just escaped a life of poverty to become a successful actor and he can't seem to get over the fact that his beloved dog is dying from cancer. A few years ago when I was visiting my friends at home in Maine, we got up close and personal with a pair of leopards, who were pretty much invisible to us until we finally met them!|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the qualities of a great TV show, but as a comedy it's way too funny for comfort.In fact, it is so bad it makes me want to give up watching the series altogether. Columbo was written by Stephen J. Gould with David Slade as Columbo in his script. There were three different versions made before production and they were pretty similar. When Columbo aired on syndication I remember thinking that it was an awful film that should've been banned or even abandoned.|0
"Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge city building , the characters are all extremely realistic and they fit their respective settings well . Even though the plot could have been better or more interesting , there was a reason why I watched this movie . A bunch of high schoolers go into a bar called ""The Bowery"". This leads to an absolutely awful night. But what can you do when your friends come in and ask for your help? In this case, they get turned on by a naked stripper."|0
1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the deaths of as many people as they can before turning themselves in. The title character plays the role of an accountant hired by one of them to find money. He travels to Mexico, finds some gold, and heads to Las Vegas to pay off his debt. My first impression of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was that it felt like a poorly directed movie. It wasn't until I sat down with it again recently that I could appreciate its charm.|0
"After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to try the movie. This was my first time watching this and I thought it was one of those ""must see"" movies. What's not to like?? Well, let me begin by saying that there were some parts of this movie that didn't seem too good. I don't know exactly what happened because I really didn't watch it but I had no clue how they got the idea to have a circus act in front of a bunch of clowns dressed like bears."|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing the title and the director! But it worked out as well as it did ! Great movie. The only thing that disappointed me about it was that the script was so terrible. The plot consisted entirely of talking heads and random stuff that didn't add much to the story, and even those scenes weren't necessary to complete the whole thing. A good movie is one that has a lot of action, but doesn't lose you any sense of time.|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect when I saw this version. This was a very slow-motion horror film that I think would have been better suited for Halloween. My only gripe is that it does not have any gore, and that it seems to try to be scary every time someone goes up to somebody else. The only real gore I can see is a guy falling off a horse and breaking his neck after being stabbed by a woman in the chest.|0
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and Chris O'Rourke, we see just how much fun it really is to be a young man trapped in a woman's body. It was an enjoyable but not too great movie. There wasn't anything particularly brilliant or unique about it. It just had the right amount of violence and sex for me to care about it. I mean, I think that all women who look like they've done it before have got their moments in this movie.|0
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber has put him through his paces with his latest hit 'Pray For Me'.I can't say I'm really impressed with Bieber's voice, but what I was disappointed to find out is that in addition to having a somewhat annoying accent, there was also nothing redeeming to it whatsoever. There is no denying that Michael Jackson's movie The Thriller was one of the worst movies ever made. What's even more frustrating is that people are still willing to watch it on video today.|0
"This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the minority as well. There are times when it just seems like the script was written specifically for a horror movie. The dialogue is really annoying and you can't figure out if any of the lines are actually funny. It would be better if the writer didn't seem to care much about the subject matter at all. It has a lot of great scenes, but the acting is not very believable. I saw this movie after my first viewing of ""Pulp Fiction""."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life but never actually seen or heard of this movie ) people have been talking crap about this movie and it is not the most recent, but that doesn't even matter. This movie is garbage. The cast are just plain bad. No chemistry whatsoever between any two parts. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue which only makes me want to vomit. A lot of times I wonder if the actors are so dumb that they didn't know better.|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . I do know one thing though, that was a good story about a boy in his teen years. It was very funny, and well written. The only thing is it did not get enough attention or respect. I can't believe this show actually lasted this long...and I am just going to tell you what the plot is like. First off, there are many characters to love and care for but none of them are around for more than 90 minutes at most.|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the very first scene. You know something's going to break, even if you can't feel it, because the camera moves so fast that everything seems to slow down or even disappear altogether! What I didn't expect was that this movie would end up costing over $30 million dollars and be such an embarrassment to the movie industry. This movie is not only stupid and dumb looking, but also has some serious moral issues concerning children.|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite some cheesy acting and not getting enough action scenes to keep up with the original, this film is just another garbage flick. So, how do you make a ""great"" movie? Well, I would think there are a few ways.First of all, get the right person on the set (at least that's what I thought). There is nothing wrong with someone taking off their clothes when working out. Everyone should be clothed in their own way."|0
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson who was just about as awful as could possibly be. But this film doesn't need a score, so I gave it a ten. What can I say ? It isn't even bad ! There is nothing to suggest it's going to make you go away from your seat at the cinema. Instead it gives you an hour and twenty minutes to get through all the boring crap in order to find something worthwhile out of it (see the end of the description).|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to be this funny. The only thing I liked about the story was the ending. I always wondered if this film was made to sell the idea that there was a real world, but you can't go there unless you leave the movie behind and move on into something else. This movie is a total dud. There are so many elements that make this movie interesting. One of them is how well-acted each character is. They act like they're actors who have spent years rehearsing for their next roles.|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather sit down for a drink with his girlfriend'. The most interesting thing I've seen in this series was that they didn't want to follow up on what happened in the first few episodes as it seemed that the viewer may not even have gotten the whole of the main story, or even read all five episodes. For those who enjoy sci-fi movies, I'd suggest getting rid of this one.It is absolutely NOT worth watching any other version of this movie.|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . This film was quite bad, although not as bad as those that have made films in the last two years. It starts with a guy playing guitar in a desert and he meets his wife who happens to be an artist. After her death (who knows what would happen afterwards?) he goes back to his home where he will meet up with his young children. He ends up getting into trouble with some local gang members.|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play as the characters struggle with the reality of their situations. It is a beautiful film that was directed by William Wyler. He is known for his short films in the late 70's and early 80's but this one was different because he had written a script that had been adapted from a novel, which made it more believable. In the beginning we are in a bar (one of my favorite bars in the city at least) and everyone seems to enjoy some kind of conversation.|0
"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . I wouldn't have minded seeing it if it was not so boring. It's almost like you've got to go back to the 80s and watch this film to understand what's happening.The music in this movie is terrible , the acting is atrocious too. It seems as though every time a new TV series comes onto the air, someone (or several people) will write about the show and say, ""it sucks""."|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
"Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another example of a man getting what he wants (or is allowed to get away with), but there is an element of truth in that.Charles Bronson's early films are often described as ""horrifying"", and they certainly were not by all means. They did, however, leave behind some truly disturbing scenes, one of which was probably the best scene in the entire collection.I'll start by saying I wasn't a fan of this movie until I saw the previews."|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just a story about love, jealousy and the need to kill your ex-girlfriend for revenge. When they do it is very emotional and painful but I could have done without seeing any of those emotions. A really annoying character in the movie makes me hate him so hard that I kept turning the subtitles off at least until halfway through. I watched this movie because it was being released on Netflix as an early Christmas present. I never knew what I was getting into when I went out with my friend last night.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
