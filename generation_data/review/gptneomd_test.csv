This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the director does a great job in giving his story a dramatic tone, as all the characters have very strong personalities . The cinematography and the editing were also very good , and the special effects , especially the CGI , were well-done . But the one thing that didn't do it justice is that the story is pretty simple, which means the film has a short length to get to its climax . That's a pity , because the film is well-made , and it makes you think and remember things you never knew.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , in most cases , the way a man or a lady should treat a woman or man in every situation and at every level, this movie will show you the beauty and the grace in every aspect of relationships . And the message is good, the message is very important, because it is one of the things a woman or a man can be proud to be a woman or man in this world and in this generation . This is a movie for those of you who are still a kid .|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . It is so well written , I have cried reading it . If I had to pick one thing to improve in my writing skills , I would say to be more specific in my vocabulary , I often find that I am trying to say things when they do not even apply to me .This is especially true for my descriptions , which I often describe people who are not even as close as they think , they might as well be a fly on the wall .|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent trying to rescue a couple of teenagers who have run away from foster care . The plot quickly takes us back to the USA where this film took place , where it was shot . While the story deals with teenagers , the story is very good and very believable . The acting is very good . It was a wonderful experience to watch this film . The story of these kids is very sad . A lot of tears are shed along with laughter .|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly surprising, and very well-written. And it's even a bit more fun than you might have expected. I've read a fair amount on this film and on Billy , but I have not read anything on this one . It seems like it's going to have a difficult time getting wide release , unless it gets picked up by HBO and becomes a TV series . I would recommend seeing it on HBO . This is not your typical comedy , and I don't say that lightly.|0
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does its job quite well. But as you watch, you can't help but ask yourself , are they doing it for the fun ? Is it meant to be ? Are they just fooling people into being surprised ? I think they are. But then again, maybe it's their intention, maybe we're fooled by them and not the film , and that makes me very happy , so let's see if they can pull off a feat as impressive as that.|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind. I’d watch it as a child, then the next summer as a teenager and the next as a young adult. The fact that it exists today is a testament to its lasting impact on me, and to the quality of the show that made it possible. While I have no particular memory of watching it at any point in my life before college, I do remember seeing the series on PBS in New York on the night of its original air date.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him on the back and smashes his face to a pulp. There is blood everywhere but he just sits there in his own bloody mess. His wife tries to revive him with some water, but he's beyond her, so she lets him go with a promise she'll be home to help in time. That night, the husband has a dream where he is at home and sees his wife in her coffin.|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing.' If you like the Irish film it would be a great film to see, but if you are a true Irish Catholic it's a great film to watch. This movie has got it all! It starts with the introduction of three people: the girl, a guy and their dog. They all meet for the first time and all three of them dance. All three people sing together and they get along with the other people in the theatre.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic lines and that the American Dream, as envisioned by George W. Bush and the rest of his ilk, is more than the sum of its parts. That is, it includes the ability and willingness of some to pursue their own individual dreams, but that they can do so is not only possible for those of us in the private sector, but it can also be accomplished by those in public, government and business. This isn’t the first time we have seen this movie in a more recent format.|0
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every woman at the bar thinking they are hot , romantic without having them all falling over for each other, and a little sad without all the romance. If there is a movie that can be described as both , I am not saying they are exactly the same , however , they could both be good . I have always loved a good dramatic , romantic , emotional movie that is set in a location , but it doesn't have to be in a city , town , island , etc.|0
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine directing and acting skills, there'd have been a great chance for this flick to go over in the Oscar nominations . But that's not the case at all . A classic film with great special effects , outstanding acting skills , and excellent music . Busey is not only a great director but a good actor . His performance was perfect . This is one of the greatest and most popular movies ever made . It will live long in the memory , and will stay as a classic .|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
"WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... I am sure that it would have been very good. ""What we can't be sure about, what we don't know for certain, is exactly how this thing works, and what the implications might be."" ""It's an interesting idea, I like it. We should get back to the drawing board."" ""We don't know."" ""What do you mean we don't?"""|0
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned this movie out, because I really don't care to see this movie any more, and it's not worth paying a penny for. It's a movie of a bunch of people that can't even get together to watch a film they want to see. This movie was so bad, it's ridiculous. I'm sorry but this movie is still one of the best things I have seen in a while.|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
"`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because it seems he will get his first All-Star Game MVP honor this year . ""I'm looking forward to being back on the floor with our team,"" said Nesmith, who averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds for his hometown Atlanta Hawks . ""It's an amazing group of guys to have here in Atlanta, and it's a really special moment for me because I grew up playing for them, and I'm back to play against 'em."""|0
"If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this movie! This movie is just for kids and not for mature audiences. This movie was made to entertain and it does! It is a kids movie and you have to be a kid and not a parent to understand the storyline of this movie to enjoy it with your kids! Watch the trailer of this movie here: http://www.mymovie.com/trailer.html

What is this movie?!?!? This is not an adult movie!"|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself I do n't see a difference with that , maybe a little bit . I think it's great , though I was not a fan of any of the other Egyptian films I saw , so this one is definitely worth a watch . It's no secret I'm not a big fan of most Egyptian films but I always enjoy Egyptian Cinema . There are a few films that I watch regularly that are very Egyptian and that is what I enjoy the most , I hope I never forget this one .|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't that good , but they are decent enough to hold your attention . I would give this one a higher rating if I were to rate movies based on entertainment value , but since I'm rating movies based on how I like it, I'll give it a 10/10. The movie looks great , the characters and situations are well written , and the story and plot is quite well thought out . The only thing I found annoying about this movie is the ending .|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me with it’s beautiful imagery, haunting cinematography and the fact that it wasn’t about a female hero or heroine , but that was ok with me. The rest of the film I had forgotten all about. From the opening scenes , the film is full of beautiful visuals. I just wanted to jump on the band wagon and start dancing. There are a lot of good performances in this film , especially for a horror movie. The acting is top notch.|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read them all but most are so very general in that they do not tell you anything of interest. This review does. Barnens' first book, Lärarna, has a short introduction but is worth reading. In Swedish and English. In English it is quite readable. It does a great job of putting you into the characters' shoes. This book is about a young man's relationship with an older woman, who, for better or for worse, decides he will never have sex with her.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in Indian culture. This is an experience that you will want to share with all your friends. So, let’s begin! This story is a love story between two people, a boy and a girl. In this story, you will see the love story between two children. In all the scenes of this story, I have done the best I could. The entire film was shot with the use of real life location, which also helped a lot to make it authentic.|0
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was so very cute in the show . And I really love how she looks when she's playing with them . She can act so well . : ) It's so cool because she's really talented ! I would like to see all the other ones , cause i really like the show , and i like how she looks in each of the shows , but she's so adorable , I just want to watch all the other ones .|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's very exciting because you can do the thing that you love most, but it also make you realize what love truly means and what you 're actually doing to the people that you love .I love this book because it 's very different from the others in this category.This story was told in a very unique way, it is not a typical story in a book. It is something that you need to experience in a different manner. This story is about love.|0
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do Rock 'n` Roll ``. In the second transformation scene , does that song come up ? I 've heard it was `` When You Wish upon A Star ``. When you wish for a star, you 've got two options. You can look up into the sky and hope you get one of the right ones that night and hope you don 't meet a star that wasn 't the right one for that particular night. That is the second option.|0
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which covers the history of the building in which the name of Kahn is first recorded, Kahn is the first architectural genius ever to be born . The documentary was screened at TED in 2005 and the film was also shown at the Venice Film Festival. The film is a must for the architectural history buffs. This building is a symbol of the modernist spirit in the 20th century. Built in 1921 by Louis Kahn , the tower is a landmark in its own right.|0
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the guest line-up, this is a show I am very proud of. With so many people performing at the same time, it makes you have a great time listening to them, and we do ! It's been a while since our last broadcast on the channel, so it was a good time to revisit the show we were working on back in May ! It was so much fun to make the show with our friends, especially Rupert and Linda , who really got us talking!|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Friedkin's films since they are often about a man coming out of prison and going down to his family in New Orleans to seek his fortune. His brother, a successful insurance agent, sets out on a business trip to the southern U.S. , and his brother-in-law's son dies of AIDS. When the film was released it got a lot of good reviews, including a rave review by Richard Roeper who called it a master class in the writing of a modern-day tragedy, and the director's masterpiece.|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it with some good old British humour and laughter. I'm a big movie fan, but I do like to see a decent film with some fun and humour. This was no different and I was glad I had a quiet night and a decent film to look forward too. The plot is predictable at times. There is no character development in it and it takes too long for the audience to become invested with the character. It is quite a long story and there is no resolution.|0
"I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. I'm pretty sure there were some parts in it I did not understand and could not make it work. I think that the biggest problem I have with the movie and I don't even know if this is a valid criticism or not, but it's very repetitive. I kept thinking ""this movie is not supposed to be this long"". The only good part of the film is the first act. It's the only part I did get it."|0
"I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man , a young girl , a group of children , an old , mysterious lady . The movie is called ""The Curse of the Blood Monster"". And it is based on a story that is still being told today . It was the first time I had seen a horror film with a young girl . This time around , it was an eight-year-old girl . But I must say , this film is so dark , that I would rather watch the older version."|0
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . The film was well made . There were some bad acting and some bad script . But the film was well made and good story . Good story , good actor . I liked all in this movie and enjoyed it . I think it will be a big hit on television and DVD ! It was well made , a good film but I don't know how it would work in the theatre . The director is very good . I think it was worth seeing .|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the first draft. This is a story about a teenager who gets caught up in a world he didn’t understand. He had been raised in a home without religion, so when he realizes his life is being dominated by people who believe what they want to believe he goes to the movies, and finds that his life has nothing to do with it. His parents have no idea what he is going through or what the world really is, as they live in America.|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great characters , good music , a decent love story and a lot of emotion in the end . This film has a story that has been seen in many movies before , this time with some great actors in the lead . It was a great film from start to the end . The movie had many emotions . The acting and writing was well done . Great film , worth to see again. I give the movie a good rating because it showed us what it is like to be in the middle class .|0
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,`` but the main attraction in this version is not an animal, but the way in which a leopard turns the human into a man. The English Patient (1960), the only film ever produced on the leopard, also features the actor Robert Shaw in his last role, playing a doctor who takes on leprosy in the same manner as the film ```The Man Who Came to Dinner ``(1963).|0
"Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of girlfriends because she doesn't give a shit if someone likes her

Jade isn't your average girl. In fact, Jade's not even your average person. She is, instead, a woman who doesn't give a shit about the people she doesn't like. Not that Jade didn't have a lot of lovers, but she only cares about one man. She's that girl who sits in her car in the parking lot at work. She does that a lot."|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch on TV . I like that she has done so many good things in this world , and I like that she has no agenda . She is so very different from the ones I grew up with in the 80's . I like her humor , her honesty , and her sense of humor . She doesn't sugar coat everything . There are so many reasons why I like her , but this is the one I love . So , she is a fun person .|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it has made it on to your list. I hope I can be a part of helping out on the set and seeing it. I can see this as a ``great movie '' or even ``not so good movie '' . I would be delighted to have the chance to help out on the set of this movie. I know it is well made and has a great storyline. I am just a little unsure about my involvement on the set as it could cause problems.|0

( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a job and without a college degree. He is desperate, and in desperate measures he tries to win back some of the attention his parents have turned to his younger brother, a troubled young drug dealer.

This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite some of the problems with the original, which I will discuss in a later post , The movie is very well done and I give it a 4 out of 5 for a good remake . All in all this movie is not to bad . You should definitely watch this movie , but watch it on your laptop or in your dvd player , just make sure it goes on fast , I did not enjoy the original , so there are a few instances where I had to fast forward .|0
"I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . In my opinion , the film isn't bad , it just doesn't have the impact or impact that I hoped it would have . I am still trying to work out why I love the film so much . If you have a chance to see it , give Blind Spot a try , as it will make you laugh and you may find it interesting. Tuesday, December 29, 2013

Last week , I went to a movie in Coyoacan to see Blind Spot."|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies now as I do not like to think of myself a movie buff. In a way I suppose I am very much a movie buff. I think that watching movies is the only thing that I have always been able to spend time on in my entire life. It’s what I do. It’s what has shaped my life in many ways and I do it with no particular interest in what the storyline might be about, so I will not dwell on that here.|0
"What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy that he is , but no one should be expecting that he would turn out to be anything but the nutter he really is , and that he was actually born on the cusp of what we now call the '70s . It all started when this guy with a face that reminded him of a monkey was asked by some friends what his favorite food was, he replied "" Anything that makes you go nutty "". And that is what he has been doing , so far , all of the nuttiest things ."|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in Italy in 1932, the film is an early entry into a long line of Fulci horror films that would end up in his goreplasmic trilogy. In terms of story, this early film has a very good plot that is a bit slow, and it has some great characters and effects that are really well done. In terms of effects, this early film has some pretty great and memorable effects, like when a man is dragged up by the hair and strangled.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. I don't want to get into spoilers. There's a good chance this will be seen by everyone as well. However, I thought I should write this anyway, as I have watched it for the first time in a long time, and that's a very rare thing. For those that aren't familiar, here's the thing: the first ten minutes is a very funny thing.|0
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only grossed $1.6M in the opening weekend. The film was released on September 30, 2009 in the U.S. in 2D and was released in the UK on December 4, 2009 on DVD and Blu-ray and in 2D in 2011. It is now available in the USA in 2D, 2.35, and Blu-ray. Plot: An aristocratic family lives in a mansion in Greece, which has been usurped by the son of one of the family. This family is called the Aristorcats and they live peacefully with their servants.|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception . In 1915, Chaplin’s A Night in Casablanca (starring John Gilbert) was a hit. It was released in 1915 and made $25,000 at the box office. The film is said to be one of Charlie’s most popular of all time . This film was made with a budget of $4 million, but Chaplin and his business partner, Jules Stoppard , managed to turn that into $24 million in revenue .|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a street when a group of men attack. James, thinking they’re muggers, tries to intervene. Luca, on the opposite side, sees him as a “chicken” and shoots him in the head. But the scene is cut before James can react. He thinks it’s the end of an ordinary day at the office and is surprised when the men start shouting, and the camera pulls back in order to show more violence.|0
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but the supernatural element here would have to be subtle and in a way that does not disturb the viewer too much. You have to admire the creative team who have used such a dark and disturbing theme to tell a gripping story, and they have done it without making the viewer sick. This film doesn’t lack for suspense either, because it is a thriller with a dark undertone, which means that the film will keep you wondering and wondering what will happen next , and how will things go.|0
"Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with a plot full of twists and surprises that you never see coming . The first thing that gets you is the scene where they set up a trap and the rest of the episodes are like that but this was much better than the rest

The only thing that I noticed was that every episode was so predictable. I know that there are some episodes where we get more surprises than the others but it was not enough for me to enjoy this episode."|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an 80's movie but there's so much life in its characters and the way it's written , you can feel it all from the get go . The story of this movie is based on real history and it is based on historical events . You don't just have the names of the ships and names of crew , you really have the real history . You see it as a character and you feel all the history that happened .|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling, but the film is a masterwork of a very different nature. It shows a man who was a true master of film, not so much by his technique, but by his manner of working with film on a larger scale. As we look through his work and through the early days, it's hard to say how many of the films we've been shown were actually produced in the years from 1929 to 1933.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , who had to go back to work after being cast as Missy in a Broadway show , as well as a new character named Maxine , who was introduced in a later episode. But this Columbo episode begins with Peter Falk , who is asked to explain himself to the viewers about the murder investigation. His explanation will be his last one. After this episode airs, we get to know much more about the investigation.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
"Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a growing number of films based upon a true story that may have a chance of making it big . One such example is the TV movie ""Troy"" starring Will Smith , a film that was recently released to theaters . Based upon the true story of the real life child rape of a 13 year old high school student , the film focuses on a young boy named Troy Davis , who was convicted of raping a young girl while a student at a local high school ."|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. I found it very easy to follow , the dialogue flowed well, and I found the acting of the whole cast very good , with a few minor issues . This is a film that is well done and I loved it . I highly recommend it . The movie is very entertaining , there are many funny lines and the cast does a good job with their roles . Highly recommended . The picture looks good in HD .|0
"The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind ever made . . . »

And it really does have the power : it was the last great motion picture of the decade, it made audiences feel like they were watching something truly incredible, and, of course, it is a very big deal in film-history circles. The film was the last of a rare breed : a film that had the power to affect the lives of the general public and even the cinema world in a direct and dramatic manner."|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact, they have managed to retain their unique style of songwriting. The band has released 15 albums and six compilation albums , and has been involved with a multitude of films and TV shows. However, they seem to have found a way to combine their talents, producing some of the most popular albums of the last two decades. As such, we decided to look back at ‘The Best of Black Sabbath: 20 Years On’ .|0
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things I haven't seen or thought of for a long time

First of all I don't have a problem with anyone who likes Chucky but I do have some problems with some people. I know that I was not one of them. I think a lot of the problems you have with the character are rooted in things you may have forgotten. I like chucky, I love his comic and I think he is one of the greatest comic characters ever made."|0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) but it really hasn't really taken off. So I decided to go ahead and try this out on my own - I have seen the show before, but can't seem to remember where - so it's just me, this time. It's an awesome show because it's a great mix of old and new, so I am going to post a bunch of links, pictures and such to help you guys get to know the show - I promise I am not trying to steal anyone's ideas!|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another like it , the story line are great , the acting is very great , the dialog is very good . A great film .The only thing that I can think is that its a little too fast for me to see it in its entirety . If you are looking for a film like this , then you should watch it , if you have not seen it , do it . It 's worth the watch . A wonderful film. I have always found that it is very well put together.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary is not a nice guy. I know he is good and i know his character is bad, but i was not prepared for so much abuse. But he wasn't horrible, i really thought he was really nice, but i still have to wait to see what he has to say. And i really, really wanted him to be really good. And it seems like all his scenes in the movie are horrible.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, I believe, or Netflix. Here's one that I saw recently, but haven't really seen before. It's about a police detective who investigates serial killer's. The movie has some strong acting, and a well-constructed thriller-like plot. The last time I saw a true-crime movie, it was a good one, but definitely not a best-film-I've-seen. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you go watch it soon. It's worth it!|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families in search of a better life. They set sail in a small boat and are caught in a raging storm that sweeps them across several hundred miles of sea. As their ship crashes into a lifeboat, their captors murder most of the men and then throw them overboard to try to escape. Only one of the survivors is an African named Peter, and the others are Europeans. The characters are very different. One is an older man who works with his uncle as a doctor in an African slum in Paris.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must have watched a hundred and twenty episodes and it’s been over a decade since the last one. I’m not here to discuss what the Simpsons has done in terms of plot and character development, or what it means to me what they’re doing in this season and the season before. I want to talk about what is the most memorable part of each episode, the thing that I feel makes me go back to that episode time and time again.|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the conventions of a traditional documentary, but it’s really a narrative. A narrative is a story with a linear beginning, a middle and an end, and there are lots of them. An example of a traditional documentary would be the opening credits for a movie about a car accident, where you’d see the accident happening right away and you’d learn more about its cause and effect. A narrative is different, though.|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I love this woman , I feel that I'm in her inner circle . This is sooo funny , it's great ! I can tell that this woman is truly in love . I feel that all women are , I can relate to the fact that we all want something different from our boyfriend , but when they find that person that we love , they can't imagine the feeling , I just want to laugh with my friends . Hi Rachael Ray.|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake, it is not an ordinary thriller. I dont want to speak of the story, which is an interesting one and I do not want the title to be a cliché. The film was made as an action thriller ,and I think it is a genre that works best on a wide screen or in a big screen. The film follows a young woman who goes to work for a mysterious billionaire in order to find a missing plane.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another Hollywood thriller with a pretty decent plot . In reality, this is one of the rare films that is actually as good a crime drama as it is a horror picture . And it is one of only a few films made during the Golden Age of Horror, which is usually reserved for the early ’80s . With this movie in the ‘50s, the genre had reached a level of sophistication that it never had before .|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about the Civil War . But his most famous novel, The Sound and the Fury , is a scathing indictment of slavery. Faulkner died on June 1, 1943 at his home in Florida. His ashes were scattered near the sea at St. Augustine, Florida . Faulkner’s ashes were returned to his home, where he was laid to rest in the cemetery with two other Civil War veterans, General James Longstreet and General Leonidas Polk.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life and I am always up for an adventure ), there has been the question of whether this was the place to stay or the place to go for the filming. After all, you have the ocean, the sand, and the sun on your face from sunrise until sundown. So, the question was asked and the answer was YES. In the past several years, the house was renovated and expanded to accomodate the additional guest/crew members.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! I have never had such a good time since I started watching horror movies a few years back. It's a horror movie where a young couple is haunted by their mother's ghost who is watching over them from the bathroom. The young couple decides to try and get rid of their mother and they try several different ways . . . until the ghost comes to the couple and tells them she has come for their mother. All the characters are very well developed.|0
"I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was a good show . But I just can not get it . I am a huge fan of David Cross's writing , and of the show . However I don't think Borderline is a show that I will ever see , nor one I would recommend to anyone

I think I might see it , maybe in the theater or at a festival like Cannes , or something . I also think I would have to see it to understand it . I don't think I could put down the entire script ."|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull guy had great hair that was perfect for the cartoon . Great job to everyone involved in creating this great cartoon that will be remembered for a long time. I've watched this show before and this cartoon was better than the movie. The graphics are awesome and the character designs are nice. This was a nice movie with some great special effects, but nothing to really distinguish it from the other movie, which it was. I thought the animation in this was great and it really looked nice.|0
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a bang and never lets up until the very last frame. It takes a while to get going and the viewer will find themselves wondering whether this is a movie they will like or not. We have the usual plot device - a mad priest who has been hiding away from society. When he's discovered, the police are sent in to investigate, and when that doesn't work out, the police have to call in the priests for help.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the right look for a character he is supposed to play, but it is all right for him because he is playing a doughboy. The character that Chaplin makes, who is supposed to be a doughboy like himself but with a different look, has no business with the British army in the Great War. The doughboy Chaplin plays is in fact an officer in the British army, but his appearance is different because of the disguise he has been given.|0
Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like a B- A would work. As I said , the story is more important and I think Barnens is a good idea. It can be funny or serious , the idea is to make people laugh . In my experience, most stories are not funny. A joke can make you laugh , but it will not do it if the author doesn't have a joke. I think it is great. It would be funny.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements necessary to be an effective episode of this type.The action scenes are well-done, with a great sense of suspense from the opening sequence, and a fantastic final scene. There are a number of points where the Columbo episodes are superior to this episode. For instance, in the opening scenes of both these shows, the audience knows what to expect from the series, and what is coming, but that doesn't happen in this episode.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie was that it was very much a comedy movie. it's not a comedy film for the sake of comedy , but the reason why i say it was comedy was it had a great cast and that it was a good story and the ending. it was really good! it was a comedy. it's really a comedy! i like the ending in the end. this was a great film. i really enjoyed this movie.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of moviegoers gathered in theaters across the country to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at the theater’s front door for a ticket. The only problem? There’s not a whole lot of the ticket money that went into the box office. So the studios had to take a page from the movies of yore and put a little more cash into the theater coffers . But now the studios are facing something much more insidious: the threat of a bankruptcy.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had the title of the episode of the season. Then in the mid-1970s it became the longest running episode of television of all time, even topping out with two minutes of commercials. It also spawned the show of the same name. In that year, the Simpsons was named the most watched television program of the year by the Nielsen company according to television critics. Not only that but it won the Emmy for Outstanding Special Class Program.|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , and i wish i could have seen more . the book is so beautifully written . one thing that bothered me , and i'm not talking about the author, is that it was too slow in the book , not like the movie . a few times there was not enough action , a lot of romance , but nothing amazing . i wish that if a movie made from the book was made , that it was made more like the book.|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in spite of it being only a couple of minutes long. In the end I found the whole thing funny enough that I didn’t think it was too much. I think the problem here is that the story feels like a bit of a filler, it’s more a series of vignettes than a plot in itself and it ends up being less than satisfying overall. Still, a great example of great animation that isn’t about being over the top.|0
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I had to remove him , I have a feeling that this thread will end up like this and that is a shame . My opinion on Tweety is always the same , he's always in trouble and is always looking to be in trouble . It is time that someone stood up against him . I do like that I'm not one of the haters , that's what I want . It's the haters that just seem to jump right in the ring and start mashing heads .|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in his emotions to what's going on. I like that he isn't afraid to cry and it's nice to see that he's not embarrassed of what he feels. And while I hate the ending of the movie I also think it's awesome that he was able to get his life back. And I hope that he's able to get a happy ending. I hope that this movie will get a sequel and/or the next one is better than the first.|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '') and this one has more to be excited about! I loved the original book , but this one is my favorite so far , though it does have some things that need to be corrected, but I 'd rather have it the way it is than have the same issues with another book! Thanks for the review and if I'm reading it correctly , this one is going to be published this year, too.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it. I remember watching it from my front porch in the summertime, when the weather was still nice and warm. I also remember the times I listened to it in the wintertime, when we would have it playing in the basement or on the kitchen stove, when we had no heat in the house and would just go out and play. I was so happy to see a show come to a station that allowed it.|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the film. I'd be remiss, as an aficionado, to leave out The Dark House: A Tale Of Terror From Outer Space . There is a reason it hasn't received much of an R rating; it isn't as much as a horror movie as it is more of a science fiction. The story is set around an alien race called the Kzinti, who have colonized a remote planet and are living peacefully. The inhabitants of the planet, The Kzinti, were once the rulers of the world.|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. I was in my early twenties. I was completely fascinated with the characters that played a role in the film, particularly in the way that they carried themselves and interacted with eachother. This was in the mid to late 80’s. And I can remember watching the films over and over again. They were all amazing and I grew to appreciate the characters they played. But I was a little kid and I was mesmerized by the characters, which were very well done.|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i would never imagine my life to be in the hands of such an awesome artist . He has my heart and I am truly grateful for all his hard work and dedication . he has created some of the most beautiful pieces i have ever seen ! He is truly one of a kind. He will leave an everlasting impression on your soul ! He is one of a kind, truly ! Thank You for sharing such a beautiful man ! I've never heard of this artist.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's accused of not being the kind of director the audience actually wants to see , but rather of trying to impose his will on them in his own film. I don't necessarily mean that he's a hack , but rather the opposite, a true professional whose work is not only great , but also completely unscripted , non-stop action and blood and gore . He's a director who 's approach to his art has always allowed his movies to feel fresh and true , and without any of the predictable tropes and trappings .|0
"But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and a few supporting actors ! I enjoyed the movie and it's quite good. I've seen a lot of movies on this subject and as I said in the review, this movie was well made. I recommend it to everyone who like action movies

Disadvantages

It's not a bad film but it's quite long."|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of relationships are great . But I wish I could see more about women . It's hard to believe that a woman has just graduated with her Masters . But this is a great movie . The actors are great and I like the story very much . This is one of the best movie in last few years . The story is great but its a bit boring . The romance is great . Its a bit over the top . What a great movie .|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For me it was a fantastic film and I loved it ! Thank You so much !! The story was so beautiful and the acting and direction was fantastic, it was beautifully photographed and well-acted ! The story was very engaging and was very well-crafted ! It was very well-written and acted ! This film really left an impression ! I can't wait to see what comes next !! This film was very well-acted and well-shot. I would highly recommend it !|0
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
"People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the outcome, and they will have to be disappointed for a good reason. The story of the film is pretty much exactly what we expected, and there are still plenty of holes. So, what is the actual movie? Well, there are two major plot lines going into the film:

Plot A The first plot line takes place after the events of M.A.N.T.I.S., and the main character’s mission to find out what happened is a fairly straight-forward thing."|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , but as the days pass SCREAM has become a mere legend of it's own fame . I remember the first time I saw SCREAM , I fell in love . That's all I remember about it . I had no expectations as to its popularity . To be honest I thought it was a waste of time and money , but as I kept on reading I found it very intriguing . And to be honest , after that I was hooked on it .|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific characters, and there were many who could have been easily scared off by his style. However, that did not stop him from having his way with his audiences, and that’s fine. What I liked most about this flick is the way it managed to be a bit edgy. At one point I wondered if it would become a bloodfest, and I wonder how much of Fulci’s career he would have been remembered had it not been for the graphic violence in the film.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach its potential as I am sure any good movie should. The performances are fantastic, as well as the script . This is one of those movies that you feel as if you've seen all of its potential and more ! I don't like many of my movies, but this one I think is fantastic . I will give it a few more views, but that's it . The story line is interesting but I don't think its worth a few more view.|0
"Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do it again . I saw it once and thought it was pretty nice. It wasn’t a very good film but at least it had character development for a change . “We’ve made a decision that our main focus right now is on the next two films. So the next two will be a little bit different.”

Well, if I had to watch it again in order, I would probably go with a different opinion of it and say it wasn’t very good."|0
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the movie in question . I was told the truth about being with my husband and I told them that I was pregnant. I knew that if they knew I was pregnant, I would be charged with murder . I felt so dirty and guilty . My life was in shambles. I was so ashamed to be with my husband and I couldn't even have an abortion because it would have caused a huge scandal and I didn't think it would happen to a pregnant woman .|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the mandolin player. And, as always, the mandolin player is a lovable guy. One of the best scenes that I could find in all of the movies is the mandolin playing ""I'm on Fire"" by the Eagles. Mandolin plays a big part in the film and it doesn't go unnoticed by Cage's character. But it's not just the playing of the mandolin that's notable in this movie. Cage also brings out the role of Cage's character in a different light."|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first season's. With so many unresolved plotlines, it's hard not to feel for each character in the finale, and I think it's more than a little weird that they were able to keep the show going on this long. So it's not a surprise that the show ended up with a strong finale. However, what's also surprising is that, with all of the major characters having left by this point, the finale felt more like the end than the beginning.|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . But I think this is also the most important element . I wanted to try to give the audience just a fraction of the amount of story that could be expressed in the few minutes of dialogue . I'm not saying that this will be the last movie I write , it will be part of my body of work . And I want to give the audience just a glimpse of what they could expect in a film .|0
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I think it would be an interesting read. I wonder how many copies were made. I read this in a forum where someone posted a pic with a copy of the book. I wonder if any of the copies were ever purchased. If so, do you know if the owner was a fan or collector, or just a reader? I would love to know what happened to that book and who got the book. Thanks for any information you can provide.|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to making the greatest of all pop music, you're left wondering if the movie is actually all about the Monkees. Or, more importantly: what happened to the rest of them that we didn't see on screen? ""I'm just trying to see if you can see me,"" Monkee Monkee says. His eyes and mouth are wide open, but there's something about the way he is speaking that puts you at ease."|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
"I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age,” says the actor. “I think I’ve got to go and see him again and say goodbye. But I will always love him.” He adds: “In the last years of his life he was getting very ill. I think that’s the reason why he did so much touring.”

Buddy was one of the top-ranking rock musicians of the 1960s and an icon to his fans and the world at large."|0
"Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll have the satisfaction of seeing something like this with your friends. This is the sequel to the awesome ""The Avengers"" movie from last week, so the cast of Avengers: Endgame is here too! The story of Endgame starts out with Tony Stark taking on the mantle of his father and trying to rebuild the Avengers with the help of his new wife (Scarlett Johansson, the actress who played Maria Hill), and with some help from his daughter Jane (Mackenzie Davis)."|0
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , not some fantasy or made-up tale. The movie was released in the late 90's , before the internet or DVD's were available. I remember seeing the film when it first came out in the theatre, and I was shocked , as I thought the film was just too unbelievable for me to watch. But now that I know of it, I think it's the type of movie that's well worth seeing.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do not know what the man thinks he is doing on that set, what he is up to and what he is trying to achieve, I only know he 's giving us something beautiful to look at which is all I can hope for at this stage of my life. And if he has any doubts about the quality he's putting out there he can come back on the set and check it out for himself, for me it is all I could want.|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office, and with it the careers of all but a handful of performers. Not that it matters, since there aren't that many of them, but the film is still one of those that sticks with me. The plot was solid and the actors did pretty much all the heavy lifting themselves, but it all came together to be a mess. The problem is that the film's premise is just a little too broad for it to stick with.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just so damn beautiful. It’s no surprise to me that everyone else in the film is also stunningly beautiful, but it really is nice to see how all the girls’ eyes and bodies are complimented. I love how all the girls in the film are beautiful (I can’t help but be a bit ashamed to say it, lol), but I just love it when they’re all so perfect in their looks (and they’re all so damn good at it!).|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan. Plot
Jimmy Dolan has been living with his brother and sister, who have separated from each other for years, and have recently started living with their aunt and uncle. As a teenager Jimmy had been drinking heavily and was arrested twice for fighting with another boy; both times they were acquitted, but he is now considered a danger to his family. His brother and sister still live together but they do not speak to each other, although they are still friendly."|0
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and I went to a friend’s birthday party that took place at the house of my friend and her sister. While there I danced and drank to the tunes on the radio . The party went on all night long and my friend was the one to put me up until 2 or 3 AM in the morning after which she went home alone. I woke up in the morning and there were 2 or 3 other guys there, with me and there was also another friend that was in the group with us .|0
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, a man is trying to find his way in life and a couple of old women. I think the music was very good, the acting was good too, and I enjoyed it. There were a few bits that weren’t as good as I thought they would be, but not that many that I would have preferred to see gone. All in all a nice little film with an enjoyable story line.|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm glad to see it finally out in the world on blu ray ! It really does have its heart in the right place, but it fails to really hit the heights that it could have had, particularly in the first half-hour, when we see a lot of empty space in the timeline, and this doesn't do anything to change this. There is no real reason to want to see this film , and it is one of the best action film in the world today.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door '). This is a movie that is so very, very, very good. I have been looking for it for many months. I think you should check it out... It is one of my favorites! It is so, so very, very, very, very, very, very good. I am so glad I have the chance to go to the premiere! It was a big crowd. It was a huge crowd.|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , 1 of which i have burned to VHS tape , the other i have made a copy on video . I am so disappointed that they did not do a DVD release . The DVD release i have have been waiting to see for months . This was a movie everyone loved . Now its out of print and only has the DVD in it . This movie i wouldnt watch again . I can understand why the people did not like this movie . I know alot of people hated the movie .|0
"OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . it may have some faults as well ,but still it is a fun film ,which was made with the same spirit , and as a whole it is really a fun film and a good film , I would recommend this to you and your friends , if you liked this film you would definitely recommend this film to other friends and also to the people you know who likes this kind of movies ,

What was your reaction when you saw this film?"|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would be awful. So far, I've seen seven. I've been disappointed in each of them. There were a few exceptions, but they were rare. I've tried to learn from each of my mistakes, and I'd love to hear your experience. Thanks. The movie is a comedy, but that is what I think every film is about at that age. The comedy is not based in reality. Not sure what I thought would be the worst.|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i thought i would never fall asleep but i did. The ending wasn't the best in that it didn't come to a conclusion , but overall I'm glad it ended on the right foot. It's not perfect, but it's the best one ever. If you liked this movie , check out all the other ones made for free by me. You will not be dissapointed. It's really a pleasure. And I will continue to keep updating this blog as I go along.|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . . . with the lights out. And this is one of those movies where I want to laugh my way to the end. I'm going to tell you what I can remember, but you may not want to see the whole thing . . . or even all the way through, anyway. It's all pretty funny, but you're in for a treat. I promise you'll love it. I was talking to my mom.|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the best movies of this year because of the story that it told. I also liked it because of the cinematography. I would give the movie 4 out of 4. My rating will be based on my overall thoughts about this movie. Do let me know if I have made a mistake in my rating so that I may try to make a better one! Thanks for reading my blog, I look forward to seeing you!|0
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I liked it . So here is my own take . I think we have seen what it’s like to be inside the Mind of God. We have seen what it takes to survive. There are things we have never encountered, we have seen it and know it is possible. We have come to see what we are not, we are not what we see. I believe God has the power within us all to see and discover what He has to share with us.|0
Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness ``? If it is not the same movie, then it is either a copy or a very early one. The title is `` The Last Battle `` and the first chapter is `` Night of the Eagle ``. If it is the `` Last battle ``, then it is not the only one. In the `` Final scene, you will see a scene from another movie and it is the beginning of a different film.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that after seeing it I now think that maybe we could try to get this to the theaters to show to our younger audiences. I know this movie will be out next spring. But I would like some opinions from those of you who've seen it already. Thanks for reading. As you might know from reading my blog I grew up in New York City. I have always loved theater, it is a big part of my childhood. I love to see movies and see movies.|0
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really a sequel to the movie with that name. It was the first one that I saw after the movie. It was very entertaining. I really liked it when the movie was done. The reason I am saying that the movie did not become a sequel was because when it was released it had its own unique look. If you have not seen the movie, then it is more than worth your time and you will enjoy this series.|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but i really do like the new film. I think the plot was well thought out and the art work is well done. So I am not hating the film , but rather I just want to ask : why did they make it like this ? Why are they making a film where there is no romance? Why aren't they making a movie that is all romance and no drama. Why does the director want to ruin the romance. How is this what a romance is?|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place at the apex of horror film production. This time, though, the Italian director decided to branch out. After two of his films were pulled from release due to legal issues, Lucio decided to get back to the basics with a new movie about his favorite horror genre, which isn’t even his best-known work. “What I’ve done in this movie is take the classic elements of the zombie film, but go one level deeper,” explained Fulci.|0
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you Americans who live in England or Australia might not like this one. But if this character is not bad, what is it , who are they and what does he do. I have seen a lot of this character in American television. He was played by Tom Sizemore , he was in American TV series such as Law & Order series and Criminal Minds. I was not able to identify him in those shows because they were not American series .|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote home to offer her advice and support in an effort to keep the woman from moving in with her. After a few minutes of talking, Kate feels that she has learned a lot about her sister from the visit. However, before she leaves, Susan shows her how much she still cares for her. As they are packing to return to Sydney, Kate tries to get Susan to tell her why she's moving out of Sydney.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more popular First National comedies. Chaplin, a man who had an incredible ability to adapt his style to different types of film-makers, was a great director who made some great film-noir comedies and some very good films about people trying to get by in a bad world. Chaplin is best known these days for his very popular comedy shorts, but before he became a star, he was quite famous for other things - including a lot of films about poverty which were quite successful at the time.|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but he doesn’t overstep it as far as taking too much time with it. What is most impressive is the amount of footage that has been used. He is doing a great job of balancing the story without taking anything too serious from it. What was your first reaction when you heard that you were being asked to make an adaptation of an original story? I’ve always been a big fantasy fan and I was really looking forward to this.|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a club with their girlfriend can go there with her, even though they're not married to her."" ""And it's not like that's a bad thing?"" ""Yeah, that's the problem."" ""You see, I've been thinking about this for a very long time."" ""It's one thing to do a show."" ""I mean, it's another thing to do that show in a place where everyone knows it's happening."""|0
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I love the movie , I am sure , you will , too . It tells the story of , Garfield the Great . I saw this movie over a decade ago . It was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001 . I saw this movie with my daughter , who was 2 . I remember seeing , in theaters , one of his last movies . She remembers seeing it , too , on the theater TV . She has seen it , and it was very good .|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since it makes you feel more connected to it . It is a very well done movie that keeps the interest of the viewer. If you enjoy this type of movies , I strongly recommend you give this a watch . This movie starts off with an action scene and we see a lot of blood and blood splatter. The movie has a lot of blood , which I like , but I also think that it is very well used . The acting is also very good and well done .|0
"This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation film . It is not a cheap film . It's not overly complicated .It's a very good animation film . I love it ! You can find the complete film on iTunes . It is available on Netflix for $11.99 and on many of your favourite platforms for $11.99 as part of a download. You can also buy it as an IMAX Blu-Ray for just $14.99 ! Here's the review :

I love this film !"|0
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience has given him the ability to live off the grid. But as Sawyer tries to make his way to the island he finds out that he's being hunted by a man who will kill him if found. Sawyer's plan is to use Desmond as bait in the water to draw his prey to him. Sawyer finds Desmond's raft and gets ready to take him ashore but finds that there are too many sharks around and that the raft is floating dead in the water .|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them. The characters speak and speak to us without the usual dialogue. We hear a lot. In the end, they say almost nothing. It's as if you can hear what they've said and not want to, because they have no idea. The film works on three levels. It wants to tell us what we expect to hear from them. We hear about them and we believe them. But we also have to hear them, because we're watching them.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the film to be one of a kind in so many ways: it was funny, intelligent, insightful, original, poignant, beautiful, inspiring, and so much more . I thought the message in that movie was a bit lost, in fact it seemed like it was a bit lost for me. But then again, that's the way I like things. It was like I could not get enough of it and just loved every second of it.|0
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them now. So I thought I'd share with you all some of the Disney movies that I'm obsessed with at the moment. This is just a round up of the Disney movies I've seen , and I'm sure there is more in the queue that I am yet to see. If any of you have a Disney movie that you've seen and loved then I want you to post it below, or leave a comment to let us know.|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a little slow . The plot is solid . A little too simple for some and too complicated for others . A very entertaining watch . There are enough laughs to make it worth while . But don't get too excited , there are also a large amount of horror and thriller elements , which make it feel like you are watching a horror movie at the same time . But if you're in for a good time, this is not the movie to waste your time on .|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indah'. It's not going to be an ordinary 'Hollywood action movie'. For one thing , it is set in the 1980's and early 1990's in Bali (Indonesia) and the title is derived from the 'Ali G Indah', which is the nickname given by the local people. There are lots of twists in 'Ali G Indah' but it won't be a 'moe action flick' but rather an exciting and entertaining action movie, full of twists and turns and a lot of action.|0
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite her guilt or innocence ? There is a story which is not too well known about an Irishman who married his second wife, after living for some time with her in a secluded farm in County Clare. He loved his second wife in the first marriage so much that he took on the second wife as his second wife, and he spent every free moment of the day with her. But when he learned that she was pregnant, he began to have doubts.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to know how it is! I remember watching this movie in high school and it still had the power to get me on the edge of my seat. I had a lot of trouble sleeping at night from this movie, even after I realized it was a horror movie, so my dad bought me a VHS copy. I never watched it during the first viewing and it is definitely not one of my favorite movies or TV shows, but I loved it when I saw this movie again.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make it better than this , and I didn't like many of the plot points (I'm really not a fan of this series, but I'm a sucker for an action/adventure movie). That's all i can say really, I think the film is good, and the story is good, and this is a good story to get people's attention, I just wish it was much better. __________________I'm not an evil genius.|0
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing what my husband would be doing. We all laughed as I described it. He is a great lover and knows that I am the one. I am not ashamed to admit this ... My husband has taken me to bed as he has said in the past. We have made love a hundred times and I am not ashamed to say I have never been happier. He was wrong this time ... But not wrong enough to make an apology.|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it to my wife. This is probably because I know that you'll laugh and say it yourself. But there is also a good chance that you might actually say something to your wife that is worth writing about. And if there's one thing I can count on you to do, it's to actually write something down. It makes me feel more confident to share my own experience with a woman I respect so deeply, which is why I've been so happy to do so.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad and surprised by the ending of the movie . First of all we should mention how good the movie is , it's also a good movie . The plot is great , but there is much to talk about the story , the story has a great touch to it , which makes it nice . So we should discuss the story , but this is also an emotional movie about love , loss , trust , betrayal and forgiveness . This movie is so good .|0
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' story in which an old and respectable man ( usually a former high-society dandy) takes a vacation to the countryside in order to escape the pressures of modern life. However, the protagonist is often a woman ( often a femme fatale) and the story is told in the first person in order to present the experience of the woman as the most interesting part of the film. It can thus be considered as an example of `` woman film.''|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both series share similar themes and plot. The plot revolved around a man who was involved with a gang of people who wanted to bring back a dead person and make them famous. Though he didn't know that their plan has been foiled when he was captured and put in an isolation chamber. The man was able to escape when he used his powers to bring back the dead. It was this incident which led to the rest of the gang breaking out.|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save it from the pirates. The pirates were trying to steal from Desmond. They took Desmond's boat to their camp . The pirates were trying to steal from Desmond. They took Desmonds boat to the camp . They started to fight with Desmonds boat. Then we go back to the pirates camp. Desmond is in the middle. He was trying to shoot the pirates. But they got his gun and fired it. Desmond was shot. Desmond died because the pirates shot him.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
"I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There was not a single dull moment . The dialogue was hilarious and the special effects were fantastic . I would have loved to go to a comedy club and watch this on the stage . It was a fun movie to go see at the mall . This movie is available for purchase and streaming for $8.99 here . Here are all the links to buy it

This is not the end of the world . I have no idea when or who it will end ."|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention from the beginning, you can see what is going on from the very beginning. This is not a good film for children but adults can really enjoy it . The film starts with a very well written introduction which takes you through all the action and how the characters are related. The film also gives you some background details about the characters. You get to meet some of your favourite characters , you meet many of your friends .|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be a must see for any filmmaker . I would love to see a movie about a blind kid who has to learn to see with the eyes of his mother, and his mother has no clue as to where he is or what he has seen until one day his mother finds him in her kitchen. She tells her husband and they find her son blindfolded, and his head on the ground, and then the husband finds out about his wife's son's blindness.|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World ( North America ). The name means “Golden Door”, and the story of a family’s adventure to North America is written from the perspective of the son, who was the eldest son, while his brothers were all grown up. The book begins when the father and mother, who were originally from the old world, are in the city of Naples and they are trying to find a job.|0
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that has won an award, and was not directed by someone from our side ? Have you seen a film that was directed by an award winning individual , and had no influence , no involvement ? Have you seen films that have made it to the silver screen , and not been made by our people ? Have you seen films that were produced or directed by our people ? You would have to ask the question, why ?|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! We got to take a sneak peek at all of the fun stuff we will be seeing on ABC’s new series ‘Lily & Tell’. “The show’s been in the works for awhile and it will debut in September, but now ABC has been given the green light to make a pilot.”

The first teaser is below but you can read the full article by clicking on the “Source” button in the right sidebar."|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are presented here are real, there is not a flaw and nothing that is hidden from view. What I have done was to take all my knowledge and knowledge of art, music, history and science, and applied it to the subject of the film, and created a film that gives me the greatest pleasure. I have seen the film, and now, I am absolutely convinced, that I am going to watch it again and see what happens!|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare and wonderful opportunity to get a piece of hardware that I've wanted for quite sometime now. It's the most beautiful piece I've had in forever. It feels like you're not only receiving a new machine, but something that you're getting that you've always wanted and been waiting to have for so long! The only thing is that I don't really know the meaning of life or what that will mean for me.|0
Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an alien-hunting space cop and a scientist? How did director Madden persuade them to play their roles? Can you find out more? As you can probably already tell, we're not saying this in order to be mean or unkind. We're simply trying to keep things civil and balanced between the news of the matter and our conversation about the matter. And if you want us to be more civil in the future, we promise not to write about the fact that Penelope Cruz is not a fan of Nicolas Cage.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly. In fact, in the movie , every element of the plot has already been shown. However, the film feels like it’s an extended version of ‘The Twilight Zone’ episode of the same name or ‘Superman’ or ‘Batman and Robin’. At times it seems that director Tim Burton is making a movie entirely for himself. In the opening scene , we see him standing on the stage as a young child playing a game .|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch your show a few times . You are one of my favorite people I have ever met . LOL! I remember that show! I used to watch it all the time for years. I wish I would have found you sooner. You have been my hero and I always tell people about your show and you are such a sweet person and I really love your personality. I always tell people that if you ever need someone in your corner you should not hesitate to call!|0
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to. That it is making no sense has been obvious from start to the end of this movie, where you have the characters just going on and on about nothing. All I want is an ending that makes me want to pick up a newspaper and read something that has been said about it, or a book, or something. It can't just end at a scene where the protagonist looks down at the floor, and decides to do it.|0
"The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot does have some interesting ideas in it . The OAV itself is ok though, so I think I'd rate it a 4 /5

The plot is interesting . The plot has some unique aspects to it . It will take a few more OAV stories to really get into it's depth . It's still very much worth watching though , for it's originality , which I find to be quite refreshing

The animation quality is decent . I find this animation to be very clean and the characters look great ."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
"I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to be careful with people that think the way that you do on this blog because they will become a threat to YOU if they think that way. And just so you don't think that I am ""stupid"" and ""lazy"" ... I really don't think you are and that's the truth, I've just had a long day today and I am tired. You want me to stop writing? Fine, I will."|0
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave an amazing review on the magazine, I 'm sure you 'll love this one . This is my review from E! It has been a long time coming . So let me just say it all . There was nothing I could do to help the person I was trying to talk about and now it turns out that he had been murdered . I really don 't have the words. The last thing I want is to cause him more pain and grief .|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns are involved in a lot of movies ,so I think this movie is just too funny to miss out ! This classic 80s 80 minute movie is just too funny. It's so original and so fun to see. I have seen this with my kids as well as their friends but they loved it. The only reason why I haven't seen it with my kids yet is that I wanted to see the movie first. This film has so much heart.|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
"by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his sister in an auto crash. He has a young son he loves and who is in a coma, who he thinks has died. In the opening scene , Reggie has his son in a coma , but Reggie wants to keep him alive , because the child wants to come back home. The doctor at the hospital says , ""I think your son is going to make it. Your son is alive."""|0
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and the title being a parody, the movie is really a great satire of the way society operates. The plot is actually quite entertaining. There are many ways for the characters to try and trick the audience, but the audience is the one that makes all the decisions and the movie is all about how you react to that. The character that I find to be the funniest are the one's who try to break society.|0
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers such as Roman Polanski, Robert Bresson, Ernst Lubitsch, Marcel Carné, Jean Renoir, Alfred Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock, George Cukor, Billy Wilder, Frank Borzage, Fritz Lang, George Stevens, Joseph Losey, John Sturges, Sergei Eisenstein and many more took the path to the stars. One of the great moments of this period, which came in 1967, was Jean Seberg’s first film, Vampyr.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and there's no question what happens to the human, which is what is being depicted in these animals. The first thing you might think of when you hear that is of course there's always been the idea that the cartoon is a depiction of a real life character but it's more of an extension of the fact that the cartoon is just another form of storytelling, just like the film and the novel. A cartoon is just another narrative, just as any movie or book is.|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for the Best Director Oscar) is based on Lee's experiences as an inmate in Guantanamo Bay. This story is based on the fact that he was released from Guantanamo in December 2005 after a trial that was conducted by the Bush Administration. He was released from an Iraqi prison after being tortured to the point of death, after being tortured for a year and a half, for providing information to the Iraqi Government about terrorists and drug smuggling.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is not that funny, and the characters are predictable . Still , the series deserves a second chance . It 's not a bad series by any stretch , and I recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained and have some fun . If you 're watching this , I advise you to stop reading , because the series has to go . We can 't support it , even if they do . It 's bad , but there are worse things out there , and it 's no excuse to ruin this series .|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back and I'm taking the mickey! Slaughter is the greatest rapper I've ever heard! I've seen his live performances and his videos on YouTube , but I'd like to give him my two cents' worth. It's actually his debut album and he released it for free on iTunes in the hopes it would garner some attention in the hip-hop music world. So I want you guys to do me one favour and buy this album for me.|0
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how she would act , I can see she would be a bit over the top but not so over the top as to get on peoples nerves . . . . . . . . Well, there's always the possibility . . . . . I think I might be able to get some of my money back if we don't do a sequel . . . . . Cynthia Watros was my first choice. But I had to change my mind.|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of the “other.” La Spettatrice (La Spettere), a young Italian immigrant, is forced to flee Sicily to find a new home. La Spettatrice is determined to live in Italy so she can make her fortune, but instead finds herself caught in a nightmare from which she may never awaken. She finds herself on the run and on the end of a long knife. She begins her journey by taking her young nephew to Italy and then takes a train to Florence, Italy.|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1

This was a very entertaining movie. A young girl falls into a trap. Her parents, brothers and her lover all try to help her to escape. However she falls in love with the trap master. At last the girl is able to escape. But the man is still in her life. She can still see his face. And now, he is trying to get her to return to him."|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I’m very pleased , and I’ve learned a lot more this time. It’s really very well acted . It has a very believable story , with well thought out characters , and a good performance by the cast , with a wonderful supporting character , and with a wonderful ending . It’s all there in a nutshell . And for me , that is all that matters in the grand scheme of film . The best part : I didn’t see much of the film.|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an attempt at the plot of the crime . I am including it because I can't imagine what else to include for the sake of discussion . It's a plot-in-progress . So here's how the crime would go down . First a car, a very expensive model, gets involved in an accident. The owner is thrown into a deep sleep. Suddenly the car comes to life. The car has a number of problems, one of which involves a very loud alarm .|0
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira on the show and she has just won the MTV Europe Music Awards. The only reason we can think of why she is getting the award is because of how good her acting is. We think she needs a little break after that show. She also had one of the best opening lines in a movie. We are glad that her character in that movie isn’t the only thing she has to overcome in life. The actress is very talented and she is not going to be replaced by anyone.|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was under the impression that the only way people could get into this film was by reading some reviews and watching some trailers. The trailer and reviews seemed to show that everyone was into this movie . It was a surprise that I wasn't. It was actually a pretty bad trailer. I guess I wasn't in the target audience of the trailer . So I was very disappointed to find that a good portion of the public ( and the majority of the movie reviewers ) seemed to be into this film .|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . The cast does an awesome job and the editing is done well. However, it isn't without some flaws. For starters the acting is uneven at times and there are just some lines that get lost in translation. Also, the script is a little bit confusing and confusing at times as well. As a result, the film doesn't hold your attention for long and the story is a little slow to kick in. There were a lot of minor mistakes on the editing side too.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (for better or for worse) going on right now. I'm not talking about what the director did with the script, which could be done at any moment. I'm referring to just how the biopic gets down to brass tacks. This is about how it's made, about how everything else is managed, and about how this biopic plays with the audience's expectations. I want to give a few thoughts that I've noticed, which are going to be the topics of this piece.|0
"I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I wrote an article for the New York magazine called "" The End Of The Tourist "" about the film which is now in its second screening in Philadelphia , at the end of May . The story is quite familiar , it just takes on a more urgent urgency with each subsequent screening . But this time , as the title suggests , I am not interested in tourism ; rather , what we are really interested in , and what is on our minds these days , is our survival ."|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour comes out in all directions. Sometimes it's just an oddity, sometimes there's more to it but often it's funny to look at the character in his own environment. It's great to see a show that doesn't rely too heavily on big jokes to get laughs out of it. That's something I think I have seen done too often in other series. It's a testament to how good the writing of the show is. The episode itself was pretty fantastic.|0
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
"Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang, is so excellent , but this movie has it’s own special charm. If you want to learn more, I recommend to watch it on YouTube by clicking on the following link:

I hope to see Mr. Im in my country soon , so we may get to watch him again , as I have a feeling , that he is going to have one of his best performances in his next film . Stay tuned ."|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best yet. And it's about time. After all, THE TROUBLE WITH TIBBLES episode was such a good thing. I don't think I've ever seen a television episode that I did like better than this one. I know people who feel the same way. I know people who can't stand it either, so you'd think they'd find THE BALANCE OF TERROR the best yet. And it's true, they can't stand it. But so can I.|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers for. The questions that were asked of him by those who had to be questioned were very obvious, as well as the answers he gave, and this is something you would expect to see from a professional interrogator. Instead, he found himself in a rather odd position, with some people who wanted to know the truth of his involvement in this project, and others, who wanted to have a say in the project's future.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling are just right after the picture . I am so impressed that you captured all those details so well . You really are a master at this! Thank you for this beautiful work and I am so happy to see more of your work! I’m so glad someone else enjoyed it as much as I did. I hope you are able to get more done with this one . Keep up the great work and please do not ever forget to tell us how much you appreciate our comments!|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
"It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now we know why we're in this mess . Lets just see how far we get . If anyone has a better way , feel free to post a link . I just don't get why they're all the way out in the middle. As for the story, I think the first and most important question that everyone must answer is ""Why?"". It's not because he's ""evil"" and ""not human"" or ""bad"" and ""good"" and ""human""."|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch but couldn't see anything. I don't think I've watched it before but it is well worth a look and has some good action. What are the links and other information about this movie? I want to watch this movie. Is it available on DVD? What are some good places to get it and how much is it? I was able to get a copy but I didn't realize that the DVD was part of the movie.|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of it's story, but some of it will sound like fiction. The story starts in 1980, in a small rural community in Eastern Ontario, Canada. There is an elderly man, living alone. His wife died many years ago, and his grandson, a young man about the same age as yourself, came to see him to ask for some help. The elderly man says he is happy he has a grandson, but he is also concerned for the young man.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO sites and was amazed at the level of quality. I know some people are not big football fans but there is a lot to be said for this site. The site gives you a different perspective on NFL games and I love that you can see a game in a different light. This site is worth checking out. I don’t watch any other sports. I enjoy some football and basketball but not at the level the NBA or NFL plays.|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. A talented actor and musician, he has starred in many movies and TV series as the lead, supporting or cameo role. He was also nominated for an Emmy in 2003 for his performance in the TV movie, ""The Life of Riley"". In 2003 he was one of the lead players in the movie ""Romeo and Juliet"", which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. In 1997, he was a guest in one episode of the American soap opera, Days of Our Lives."|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought. But I still think I would watch it as a rental for the first week of its screening. I went to see it with friends and my wife and I saw it together. I think I will see it again. The film has a nice tone. I like the acting. It has great actors. And the chemistry between the actors is good. But in the end I thought the film was better as a rental.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
"A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not the commercial is great . I would rate this movie at a 10/10 . It is a beautiful film . The story lines that are in this movie is just beautiful . All in all this movie was definitely worth seeing . You can view it here . http://www.flickr.com/watch/1038

A movie that makes you wonder . This movie was made for the kids . I don't think that there is any doubt that this is a beautiful film . The plot line that the film is made to , was just great ."|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere seemed a little too close to Louis Leterrier , which I didn't like when I read his screenplay , which is why I never got the chance to see the film . There are only 3 scenes where it is mentioned that there are other characters playing a part in the script , but there are no scenes with them, and I did not see any mention of them on the trailers either . But I did see it, and it certainly looked interesting .|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the first person who has managed to put all the pieces together and have a successful movie about that situation. And that person has to be Steven Spielberg, who is a veteran of the Vietnam war, so he is familiar with the situation he's in, and is a brilliant director. I've always felt that a movie like Pearl Harbor, even if it was set in WWII, should have made a lot more money than it did.|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should be able to get a sense of a writer that is well educated in the writing arts. There is a definite skill in the language that the writer has, which will be apparent throughout the writing. I have no doubt that if the writer had the benefit of years of experience he would make it clear as possible to the readers the kind of writing he has been involved in, and would have given his reader a great deal of amusement.|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
"This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 Movies I've Seen in 2018. If there's one movie that deserves a rewatch, this is it. I still love it. 1. Inception



It was such a surprise that Inception opened to such overwhelming reviews - this was such a great movie to watch after watching such a mediocre movie from the 80s. It's just so great. It was just this incredible film that I can't believe nobody has seen it before. It's just the best."|0
"Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to make a documentary film about the history of architecture in America, and to examine the role of architects in society. My Architect was made in 2004, and won best documentary feature. It also won the Golden Bear for best documentary feature at the 2004 Berlin International Film Festival
. The documentary also won best documentary award at the 2004 Golden Trailer Awards
, and in 2005, The film won best film at the Cannes Film Festival."|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the soundtrack as a soundtrack so I do feel like an idiot but i don’t understand the backlash. I’m sure this is just a misunderstanding of what the game is all about. The music and the movie are both great but there’s nothing in this movie that the soundtrack would be a better fit for. The movie is well-written and tells a story, the game is just a bad game with bad music. I think we all know this.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's , but that doesn't mean that is a film that can be seen in this time. I was looking forward to it because the subject of it seemed to be so interesting. It was supposed to be on TV and to some, it was not the best film they had to offer, but it still was entertaining and well made. Not all movies are meant to be watched at a specific time or even in a particular form of entertainment.|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of art have this power to draw people to them as a whole and not just to any one specific scene. It is often hard for a film to capture its audience's attention and create a strong emotional response as well as engage the viewer intellectually . So in the end, for me it is not so much that this film is ""bad"", but rather it is a great piece of art, but one that is a bit of a downer in my mind."|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1

"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . As in the original, Kersey is a scientist and the main protagonist of the movie. However, Kersey is more than that in this movie . In fact, the character of Kersey is almost the whole reason that the film was made . In order to set the story straight and to give the audience an explanation of the events that are the background to this film , there is a large part of the movie that deals with the effects that the film itself had on the characters and events .|0
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to the same. There are parts in it that make me want to get up and walk off the damn screen, but then I see my wife's reaction and know she's laughing for real and I don't want that either, so I'm laughing too. What's funny is when I was reading about this movie the other day the guy who wrote the review was saying he was laughing so much that he was just about to give up.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' It was an enjoyable film to behold, but it was never to be considered the best in the Garfield filmography. It is only a matter of months since the original print of the film, released in 1938, was destroyed, and only a couple years later the film was restored to its original version. For the next several years, this restoration has been done by the UCLA Film and Television Archive (UTAFFA), and this is the best one has yet been accomplished.|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) is beyond anything Hollywood has ever seen . I could not watch it without wanting to tear out the entire first act , but in all honesty it is one of the most incredible films on earth . I’m giving it an 8/10 because it was such a powerful story and it was so well made . The soundtrack of it was also excellent . It is one of the few movies I really like to see live because it is so well told .|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper's performance as one of the robbers has always been the highlight for me in this film . I was surprised with the quality of the music that Hopper's character brings . I have to say that this is his best film to date . I'm not sure how well this will do if it does get an Oscar nomination ... but it's very good , if only because it is Hopper's best film . I don't think he'll win an Oscar this time .|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and struggles faced by the American population when they find themselves in the United States. It is also a critique on what it takes for an immigrant to become fully integrated into the US society. I hope you enjoy this film ! As you know , I love movies. Movies are something I go to watch every weekend and it is something I am always interested in. I love to see how a movie makes people feel and what it means.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some of his early ones , and there are some of my favourite parts of his early films . I have even seen a lot of his films , and I must say I can 't wait to see his latest movie . He is such a talented filmmaker , he should have more work , and I will be watching and reviewing his films . My first impression of his latest film is the same as my first impression of the previous ones , he makes me laugh a lot , and is full of his trademark humour .|0
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation on this topic, and also made a big difference in my decision on the decision I am making regarding this purchase. This video is a very short one of 5 or 6 mins , but it’s the most comprehensive I have seen , that gives an accurate explanation on what is going on , from the beginning of all the problems that have happened, and how we can all be part of a solution . I highly recommend this for all of you that are looking for help on this topic.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is a testament to the value of a film’s story , and it is the only film that can be made to work , and be seen by the average moviegoer today , because of the way the story was conceived , by the way the actors and the director acted and directed it , and the way the entire cast and the crew were brought together , and the way the script and the direction and the production values were made to work together . A film is a film .|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values were top notch . The cinematography , songs and soundtrack added up to the best film in my opinion , and the special effects were truly impressive . This is what made the movie to win many awards at the Oscars .The movie has been made available to the general public via the Netflix website , but I have to tell you it wasn’t quite perfect .It was quite disappointing that the Netflix release didn’t include the complete movie .|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been a huge shame if the show had to do all that cooking ). But it was really a variety show and in a good show like this you have a couple of guests. I don't really think you have to have an audience. I'm sure you had a great audience, there's just too many people to talk to. The only show in the country I really watch and I really liked it. Good to see that the weather's finally cooling down.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . It’s not in the book . I got the idea after reading the book . I have read books by Verne before so I thought it’d be fun to make my own . It was a good choice . I don’t care about the movie much . It has nothing to do with the book so I’ll skip the film . My sister’s a big fan of this movie . I love all the action sequences in the book so I think they fit the movie quite nicely .|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter had a career that reached its apex in the early 1960’s. Holly began his career by playing piano in his church in Los Angeles, California. He moved on to other local bands, performing in rock clubs, and touring the country, until he finally settled down to writing and recording songs. On the surface, it’s hard to imagine the beginning of the ‘60s rock scene without the man known as Buddy Holly.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson is not annoying but he is the main character . Just a few things that stood out about the film , which were things I had not realized about the movie. The main thing for me is the story and the main characters. This film had so much potential but could not deliver in my opinion . 1. The main characters. I really liked this film , the characters are great and I love the storyline. I would like to see more action .|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Kral, which was presented by a very special private collector to his son Jan Kral Kral. In this remarkable film, which was a real gift from a young Czech collector, Kral uses all of his skills in his film making. Kral shot the film in a very high quality color film, and this film is truly unique and amazing to look at. Kral is a truly talented film maker, who has created many of his works with his own unique style, which is worth seeing.|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it for real ! It was an amazing film , and the acting was on point . This is a film which I have watched several times in my life but never in depth .I am not going to say too much about this but I just wanted to express my thoughts and feelings about this film . I love it !! ! I love the characters , the story , the acting , the story line . This is one film that I will always remember !|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) as a “New Black Power”, a self-proclaimed African-American leader who, during the “Great Society”, is the target of the racist Ku Klux Klan. But when he becomes a member of the White House White House Commission on African Affairs, which is charged by President Carter’s new black administration with creating an African-American cultural and political agenda, Swope becomes the first black president. As Swope’s presidency progresses to national prominence, Black Power and white racist politics come into conflict.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . If I were a man, there was no way I would have not made it. But I am not a man. I am only a woman, and I have to say, the way the story was told, was one of my favorite movies . The characters are so real. I am not exaggerating the love and the story. You would love it if you saw the movie. In the end of the movie there was a song, but I do not know what song it is.|0
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It doesn't matter , it's so bad . I would watch this again , but there are better films to do that. It has the makings of a great horror movie . I'm not sure if it's going to succeed or just be a cheap cheap low budget film that I won't be interested enough to see again . I can't believe that these people are still in business . Why would they do it ?|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Buddy Holly was (or that I would ever get to see him play), but I knew that I liked his music. I didn’t have any idea of any of the other musicians and bands he collaborated with or the impact his songs had on the music industry . I also didn’t care much about the politics of it all – I had no time for political music, and felt that I had an obligation to do my part in preserving the history of music we have today.|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a movie that you need to watch the entire time . The plot is well done , the acting is above reproach and the special effects are just awesome . I can not help but wonder what would have happened if all the characters on screen died ! I was impressed with what was going on and the acting was great . I'm not going into a review of the movie but I can say that this movie is a must see .|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever and entertaining...I want to add a few things.First, this has nothing to do with any dialog. It is just a movie and what you're seeing is exactly that. No one is trying to insult you, but I feel like this is not what a movie is supposed to be about. A movie is meant for entertainment, it's supposed to entertain. If it is supposed to be a drama, it should be about the drama.This is not my opinion of the dialog.|0
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out. I like it and I'm very excited for what they do next. I wish it was better, I wish they could have made it better, just like every other flick that came out in the past. I think a lot of people don't know what they're getting into and I can't blame them because it's really well put together. I just can't see this being done. It has to be done and I wish that it would be done.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really work . i think there should be a lot more violence and drug use in this episode, but as always i'm a sucker for the violence and drugs . in the middle there was an interesting line that he had said , about his own death, which was just too bad , i felt . but other than this , the whole episode was really good . it was good , but not very interesting , with a lot of too many things going on .|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still it is fun and entertaining movie even if you have not watched this movie before I recommend watching it just for the storyline and some great action scenes in the second movie I hope you have time to watch these films

This is a good film, I love it! I saw it a few weeks back and really liked it. I recommend you give it a go. It will give you some great fun action. It was just an amazing movie!"|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by poverty and crime. One of the reasons is the lack of government action. But, in a society without laws, people are left with only two options. Either, they can take whatever they can get in the form of drugs or violence. Or they can use other methods, including physical torture, to force people to comply with their will. The movie ``The Drowning Pool'' does not shy away from depicting such methods.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've had an opinion on the man. In the last couple of years, and especially in the last year I have been more and more interested in him, his films , his style of writing, the people he has working with , and even the music he has been involved in. So when I saw this article from the LA Weekly , I decided I had to put it on here , and I am going to do so now !|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
"Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time this weekend. A couple of things strike me about the film:

I have watched this film so many times I think the second time is about as close to a ""re-view"" of the film as I'm likely to encounter in my lifetime. I had forgotten what the story was all about and I've seen this movie at least two dozen times before, so having a second viewing reminded me that I should never, ever, ever give up on anything I watch on the subject."|0
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was 8. I was very impressed with it because it had everything I was looking for, but it still had a few things that I didn't get to see much of. This is an important spoiler movie because it's one of those movies that is really long but doesn't have much story, so it doesn't have many twists, but it's still fun to go through the movie and see how it all ends.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats.

I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a good time. ""If you think you can make me cry, go ahead. All you need to know about the way I feel is that I'm scared. I'm a coward. Sometimes, I feel like an animal. I can't get my head out of the mud. All I see is pain in front of my eyes."" -- ""You've Been Around"" by The Clash, from: ""A Message From The Underground""

I love the Clash."|0

When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was shocked as I thought it’s too long . I thought it would end in a good way with a good twist . But no , there’s a twist in the ending . But I loved the twist . The movie was so good . This movie has the potential to be a good movie . I have it on my watch list to watch this one . This movie has a good plot . This movie has a great action packed movie . This movie had good music .|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors were still debating whether or not to attempt another rescue attempt. If they tried to reach the boat they might miss their chances of being rescued. If they failed, they risked their own lives by swimming the river at high speeds and they risked being swept downstream to the shore. On the plus side , the crew did not need a rescue attempt, they were ready to go anyway. The survivors were not ready to give up in this episode.|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I was ) - the whole thing is about Libby trying to get information from Desmond to help her father. I believe that Libby did not know that he was a drug dealer at the time. He was probably working for the CIA, but he was getting paid more. And in the episode where Desmond is with the cops and he has his gun, he tells Desmond that they are police officers and that they do things the same way as police officers do.|0
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen it many times before, so I can say with certainty that I will not miss a second of it! I love this character and I love the fact that she is not afraid to be who she is, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable it makes her life. I would recommend this film to everyone, including anyone who has watched the Twilight movies. I don't want anyone to think that it is out of order or that I am judging her character or something.|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen in a long time , so I felt like doing my bit to bring this great man out of obscurity by putting his name to the credits as the movie director. It was a very emotional experience to watch the movie from start to finish. You can tell he is so moved by this whole experience that you feel for him and you feel for those around him. His whole life, his whole story is etched on his face.|0
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly enjoyable tale . With only a few notable exceptions . this is one of the best books to be written by any author in my opinion . And it's not as bad as the first chapter. It has some plot holes, but that is expected for a thriller, so it's forgivable . The book is narrated by a character , so the narrator is crucial , but there's really only one other person with which you can be compared . I love the plot .|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss with a new documentary that chronicles his own personal and professional struggles over three decades . In his third feature since his film debut in 1996, Director Stephan Woloszczuk weaves together three very different stories to form a unique portrait of the life of a struggling artist who is forever changed in the crucibles of love , betrayal , and betrayal. For a man who has spent his entire life in the spotlight, Stephan Woloszczuk has had a unique experience in Hollywood .|0

So, get your friends, your boyfriends, your sisters or your moms together and download the songs below for free and put them on your iTunes, Spotify, Amazon or wherever.|0
"`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and you may want to do yourself a favor and get a copy , the only reason I can think of that this film is so incredibly effective is due to the amazing cast . The film begins with the title card , followed by the opening of a swimming pool : "" . . . and all that remains of a very beautiful duck . "". As the credits roll and we see the beautiful duck float in the water . . ."|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . I don't think it's just the fact that everyone in the world has seen the original series or that they know how much the characters have changed . Like I said, the original series doesn't need to be a remake of the first one. I mean, maybe I have a point of view for the original that differs from the one that you have. But I think it's a bit too early for that.|0
"This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the Chucky movies but this is a better movie then ""Chucky 2"". This movie starts out as the same thing as all those Chucky movies and then when you find out that Chucky is alive and well and has escaped, it becomes really interesting and you never really get a good ending to it like you have with ""Chucky 2"". The best thing about ""Chucky"" is that it does a good job at capturing the essence of the original Chucky, the bad guy from ""Chucky 2""."|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? There were no lines, or characters. It’s like it never happened. It’s been out for like seven years already and the film’s been out for like two months. So that’s why I can’t tell you when it was actually made. I’ve been doing this for years and years and years. So I can’t give you a date or anything like that. So I’m not telling you.|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the sole survivor of an epidemic that left more than a dozen people dead. The disease had first struck Antônia in February , but by the time the villagers learned about it they were so sick they could no longer carry on with their lives. A doctor called to take a look at the disease says that the villagers didn’t even know they were infected, but Antônia had been lucky so far. In fact it hadn’t taken long for people to take notice of the symptoms of the infection.|0
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and the cast of Heroes, we have to wait a bit longer to see the first part of the film. We hope that we can see something of this strange creature , before the film comes back. We will be back for updates as the film progresses. Stay tuned for all the latest updates! G.I. Joe and the G.I.s have finally decided to make the jump from film to film, as it 's time. But this time around, they have to wait longer for the new G.I.|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes one is his deep compassion . There is not a single scene where he is shown to be weak . This is the main reason he is chosen for this movie , he is so powerful . He is an incredible actor . The film starts with the flashback of the events leading to the destruction of planet earth . We see an old man talking to a young boy , he is telling him he wants to visit the moon . But as the old man talks he begins to cry.|0
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I loved the film . I actually did like the film . I think that the movie is just fine . However , it is not perfect . I am going to do one thing here . After watching the movie , I thought I will tell you what I liked . I liked it as I thought it was entertaining . I thought that the movie had its good point . I also enjoyed the songs . I liked the score . It is not bad .|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch this every day to check the weather news. I know it’s not weather related, but even if it was, its not like any of the big news are reporting on it anyway and it’s not newsworthy anyway. Just to add, if you are going to a place where the news is not reported by a journalist, you need to at least make sure you do your homework to get to the source, even if it is someone else.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1

A friend of mine used to say that life is too short to spend every moment of it in bed with a partner who will not share your dreams with you. So I thought that it was time to try something different. In the process I discovered that I don't need partners in life, I can be myself and have fun, and be happy with myself."|0
"It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's not even a movie , it has to be said. This is the film that Showtime made it clear they wanted to be , in the sense that it will make you go ""oh my god , this is the kind of stuff Showtime is good at ! I 've seen a bunch of bad ones before , this just looks like one. I 'm sure they can find other people they like who are good too ."|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain is constant. The mud is everywhere. The enemy is relentless. There is nothing left but to keep on going until the end. The end may not be very far away as we enter the first year of the Great War. This was the first film to win Oscars for Best Actor for Charlie Chaplin and Best Director for George Stevens. The movie is also known for the line “When the war is over you’re going to feel so happy you might even cry”.|0
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store but now that I have it and it's on DVD I can't wait to watch it ! It's the best movie ever I think . I love it. It was so awesome. I really enjoyed the story line . I liked how the characters and the plot line went together really well . I had no clue about this movie at all . This movie is amazing . I love how it was all put together . It was so good and the acting was really well done .|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . . . and it’s great . . . I just love this book. But, just a few pages into the book, it becomes clear to me that this book is not for everyone. It’s not really meant to be read by everyone, and while it might have its appeal for some who have already read the book or are familiar with it, I don’t think I could read the book and enjoy it, or recommend it to people.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's other movie, The Snowman. The Snowqueen revolves around three different lovers: the Snow Queen, her Snow Prince and the Snow King. The Snow Queen loves him passionately, but he doesn't fall for the Snow Queen until the Snow King shows up on her doorstep. He's a man in love with the Snow Queen, and he wants to use her to get back at the Snow Queen and make things right.|0
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I’m on the fence whether this movie will be good or not . It is sooooooooooo cute and the girl in this movie is so soooooo cute . Thats all I’m sayin . . . ! . . . . ! ! ! I have to admit this movie sucks and there was just tooooooo much crying and not enough action .!! ! ! . . . . ! . . . . . !|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight is the most popular guy in the world ! He has done more interviews since he came into the sport. He is an inspiration to all the guys that follow him. I really do enjoy it when he takes the mic back for a few seconds and gives a few highlights. He is one of the best. I was really excited to hear him do some interview with the guys after his win last night . He did great and I wish him the best of luck .|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Anna Moffo . It's probably more appropriate for Anna to be the lead singer. This is her first movie. And it's an all Italian movie - it's about Italy and their relationship with Europe. But the lead singer? Anna Moffo?! No way! That's ridiculous! That's just ridiculous! You don't have to take that away from him. I can totally see her in the title song.|0
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade in this style . Not one thing wrong with this classic horror film . The acting , music and story lines were all solid . It had a certain feel that I had seen in many Sci-Fi and Horror films . I have watched a couple of this films and I loved every one of them . I thought this was the best one of the bunch . This is a classic horror movie and the music in it was great . The story line was well written .|0
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber’s “Baby” has been chosen by The Voice judges as one of the Top Ten Songs of the Year. The original “Baby” hit number one in 2010. In his debut appearance on The Voice the singer performed “Baby, Baby, Baby.”

The judges voted him out after he had performed this song on the first show, and he performed it again in the third and fourth rounds. Justin Bieber is known for being an original member of the Backstreet Boys."|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began , the episodes got less adventurous and more predictable . The episodes also started to get a bit repetitive as they felt like they were going to keep going for quite a while . The show also started to get predictable as they tried to get you in the mood for the story . The first half of the first season of OI started with the main theme of “ “ . This theme lasted throughout the series for a few episodes .|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of its leads as well as in the script and performances of its actors . The movie was a hit , even though its plot and characters may have disappointed some fans of rock biopics . At its core, this film is an exploration of drug addiction and its effects on society and on the individuals involved . The movie is based in and around drug use , addiction , and death . But the movie is not just about those things.|0
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which is also very good but is more of a children's book . I really liked the ending , the ending of the novel , and I liked a few of the details in the book . But all of it was just so good ! I would recommend this film as a must see . I would recommend this film to people my age or above . It has great story and wonderful music . This review is a bit late but I can not get over it .|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a non-disabled role? His performance was so convincing as the disabled person in the role as well; it looked so real, and seemed so believable. What makes his performance so convincing is that he has the ability to play the disabled character as well. I have watched many disabled people portray themselves in such a dramatic way on screen. What I found most unique about him was the way he portrayed the disabled character. To me, it felt really natural and true.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : )



But in my opinion, I don't really like it. The music is great and the story is interesting. I would like to like this more than I dislike it. I'd like a sequel with a bit more substance. I will be a bit disappointed if I don't like this at all. Might as well go out with a whim. It's all a matter of opinion. I found it to be good , it's not the best but it has a lot of potential."|0
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows a lot of scenes from the film and a few scenes from the 1958 film . The original O'Brien movie is on Netflix, and if you can watch it with a popcorn and a soda, you'll find it to be the better film . You don't need to see the remake for that . The plot is as follows . O'Brien, an Irish-born American man, returns to live in Ireland and be a farmer. O'Brien lives a life of luxury and luxury becomes his mistress .|0
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's dark, disturbing, gory and macabre themes that make you question your own humanity. In this documentary, Fulci explores the idea of killing a human being for his or her death. `` A film like this one needs to take place somewhere in the real world to make any sense at all. How can you kill an entire person in cold blood for being a human being? What is the point of this film?'' Fulci wondered.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , but now I have to make it clear, this is my blog. It is NOT a Navy publication or official Navy site. It does not claim to be the official Naval Aviation News, and I have no connection with them in any capacity. However, this blog does cover my personal experience of the Navy as well as Navy aviation, so you won't find a lot of Navy stuff here. This blog will be dedicated to providing my perspective on what life has been like for me.|0
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written. So, what has been done since then, in response to what I wrote, is to make more detailed arguments, which I am going to make available as a follow up to the first comment. The following is a more detailed description of how the arguments work. I'm going to make a new blog, a blog that will contain some of my work over the next year, to make this work more smoothly.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . The first time I heard it, I thought it was so weird, I couldn't get it out of my mind. Even though I'd never seen it, the music, the acting, the dancing, it was the perfect match to the characters, the story . It is the definition of campiness! LOST HORN is the third movie I've ever been forced to watch. I didn't know if I was in the right town, or even if I liked it.|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
"I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It's not a one-shot show and it's only been a few weeks. I have no idea who will win but I will watch to see . __________________

This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY subway system in general, not just New Haven's subway in particular. It's a cool place to go and has some good photo ops of it in action. Here you can find a photo of where it is located and where it was built , and there you can get more information on their website. You can also go on their facebook page for a lot more information. This place is a lot of fun for kids to play, as well as very educational.|0
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their day . But I do like the fact that he keeps trying to reinvent his art. For example , I 'm happy to see him get some new roles . I'm also happy about the fact that he's getting some more good ones as well . And I' ll look to see how well he continues to evolve with these films. I 've liked his films . but I ' m not sure I can stand all his sequels .|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of the most entertaining and enjoyable TV shows I have ever seen or heard .... It's like an episode of THE MANHATTAN SHANGHAI .... The only thing missing from this series (and even that it was just a tad bit too much) was some of the action/violence ... It was a series filled with action and suspense .... and it really made me think ... I have never seen a show like this or even read an article of one like it before ... Well I can say ...|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. It was made in 1975. In the story, Hari is the leader of a guerrilla group and in the first half of the film he is sent on a mission. In the second half of the movie we meet him again in the company of the young soldier. Hari was one of the most loved and well liked actors in Hindi Cinema. He was also loved and well liked by the people of Hindi Cinema for his roles and also as a man of valour and courage that he always had.|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The film has been seen as one of the better examples of its kind , and also the closest thing to the idea that I had in mind when I saw it on a DVD box set . It's not a good film for all people , but for some people , it will be a better option that other post apocalyptic films . And even if you do not like the ending , you will probably still watch it for some of the movie's most interesting parts .|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video reviews of movies and tv shows. I will be honest I like to read tech news on a daily basis as well as to see what new and emerging technology is coming out in the world. I also enjoy watching movies. I am able to enjoy movies that are out right now as well as some movies that will come out very soon. I think the show provides very detailed info about the upcoming new technology that will be available for purchase.|0
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks ,but never have I seen a movie with as much darkness, suspense and gore . The director is a true master and I can't wait until I see his next offering . The best part about it is that Fulci makes this film his own ! I think it's a masterpiece and I 'll certainly be seeing it one day and if it's not, I hope it will make me very upset ! I have to say it is the first film that really scares me.|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments in the sea. Here’s a compilation of the best of the best!

"The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer, she could not have been as good at the dance floor or on-stage if she didn't use her body to create tension and movement that would move people. Now, thanks to the Internet, we are able to see that she was indeed extremely skilled in the art of dance but not necessarily the most graceful of dancers. ""I have never danced with anyone in person,"" she said in a statement. ""I've never really felt comfortable dancing, in any situation, with other dancers."|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in a car and go to Tokyo. But they also go into a brothel, and they become involved in the brothel-brothel business. It’s a fantastic, fantastic story. And I wanted to read it again so I could read it in a very different way. I read it for the first time almost ten years ago in the year 2000. Now, I’ve read it twice, and the second time, I really loved it.|0
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to the story by the author because I love the idea of a story in the vein of Tolstoy , set in this very strange world and its people.I read the book in one night, the first time it appeared on Kindle. I don't know about the second or third readings, however. I got it from Amazon. What's weird is that it's part of a collection. I can't really remember which author it's based on or the story is told from different perspectives.|0
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or depth of character. The film is riddled with moral dilemmas that the audience is supposed to find it difficult to answer, but this has nothing to do with a lack of plot. There is literally no point to this film. We are meant to laugh, we are meant to cry, to have a good old tear in our eyes, but not a care in the world. Why is that? Who are the ""moral characters""?"|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I think they should have been nominated for best documentary. If I was doing the review I would have gone with it. The story is well done. It's really interesting. I enjoyed it so much that I bought the series DVD as soon as I saw it. I'm glad I did. It's well filmed and well acted. I think that I might buy this DVD series from Showtime as I've been a fan of this documentary since it first aired on CBS.|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how he created an iconic piece of modernist architecture in the 1960’s that is as well-known to the world today as any of the great buildings he designed. He was an innovator who combined the latest techniques with a strong commitment to creating a contemporary style that was uniquely his own . He was also one of the first designers to design houses with large outdoor spaces. In the first half of the 20th century, architects were at the peak of their creativity and power.|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play . This is an extraordinary film , and that alone is an experience . The acting is very good , and it gives me goosebumps . The acting in this film , of course , is superb and I have seen more than one performance of this kind . The music is beautiful , there are a number of excellent scenes , as well . I love this film , it is one of those movies you simply can not go without seeing , you simply cannot escape .|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
"`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what some critics actually say is ""the best and most innovative comedy of the past decade. The movie has a lot to live up to if it wants to be a serious contender for Best Picture in Hollywood. It's funny. And it's a movie that will entertain for most of its 12-plus hours , which is more than can be said for almost any other comedy of the last ten years. And if you don't think so . . ."|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . The only problem I can see with this one is the sound is a bit out of place . I'm hoping it will become a lot more popular since it seems to bring a lot of joy . It is a very cute show , with a lot of humor and a great ending . This anime is worth watching , and I would definitely recommend . . . . . . I'm going to go out of my way to warn you about some of the things going on in this review.|0
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it! I have a question for anyone that saw it. I got to watch it at home, with friends and family. And as far as I can see Paris is not in it. It seems to me she is a very important character who is a character that has a lot more screen time in the movie than what is on screen and I am pretty sure there is more to her character than her appearances in the movie.|0
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years ago , I was watching the first season of "" The Office "" on television . My husband and I watched this series as we sat on our couch with the tv on , we couldn't wait to see what they were gonna play next . As we were watching , my husband commented that it seemed like the same guy was in a lot of shows in the last couple of years . We didn't think anything of it , thought it was a fluke ."|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge city streets in it , the city street art is fantastic. I don't know about you guys but I've spent the most time staring at the city streets , especially when I go out of town . It's really amazing to look at the city when you're out of town. I'm not saying that this is your city or your home , but it's a good thing . This city is great to explore . The city art is great.|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. He is a symbol to all who live in a modern world and for that he is hunted down and shot at point blank range. The game was first published in French on August 2, 1983. In 1988 the English version was published by Acclaim Comics. The book is published in two volumes, the second being a trade paperback. The first edition of the game came out in 1981, and is still sold today. It was reprinted for the second time in 2002.|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience at all! What happened to it ? I would think it would have come out somewhere . I can't wait for the episode where he finally has his chance. He's been in that game all along . I think it was in the 90's when they were making the show, maybe a bit before that, but I've been waiting for it for 20 years or so now. It's only a matter of time before they bring it up in the game.|0
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us into a world of corruption. This story was not created to entertain. It was not intended to be a comedy of manners. It was not envisioned as a light-hearted love story. And it was not written to be a tragicomedy. I did not intend to make a movie like this, and if anyone thinks it is they are mistaken. All of this was written to be a story that is dark and disturbing, yet very real and truthful.|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least one level it was an experience unlike anything the world has seen before. Some of the strangest, weirdest, and downright weirdest things I've ever seen or done in my life. Let me preface this by saying: I'm a person that loves to travel. I've been to many far away places and had some amazing adventures. However this is a trip to one of the strangest places I have been on this Earth.|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
"Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is the greatest comic book movie ever. So why do Milligan 's books still have a long way to go? In his new book 'Milligan: What He Thinks You Won 't Forget About ' , Milligan examines what he has in his bag of tricks to make sure that your memory will be intact as you watch the next installment of his comic. ""I don't care what they say, Spike Milligan is one of the most entertaining writers of my generation, so I'll do it in my own way."|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Gray ) who, after losing her beloved brother, decides she wants to find him. But with nowhere else to go, she wanders the countryside and becomes lost. In the woods she encounters a wolf, who becomes her protector. Eventually Gerda is found by a man named Gudrun ( Jan Erik Bylund ) who takes pity on her. She is then taken to her uncle who adopts Gerda. Gerda makes a lot of friends.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this in theaters in 2001 , and since then I’ve always been fascinated by this character . This was a rare opportunity to have him on screen in a theater setting, and I can’t thank him enough for all his work . I hope you all like the film , and if you haven’t seen it , let me know what you think in the comments below . If you are in the mood of a good popcorn movie . . .|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
"Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! When he gets out of the closet and gets into action he can be quite a frightening monster, even if he is a clown ! What can you expect from him - he will surprise you ! Now you got a new friend - let's see how he is doing ! Let's try to get a photo with him but you can't ;)

I love him so much, but he has a bad reputation among all the clowns in New York City."|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But he hasn't gone out of existence. In a way, the world's gone on without him. But in another, in a new and more sinister sense, things are about to change forever . He isn't coming back. Or perhaps his return is not something that will happen . At least not soon, at least in his own world . And we are about to discover the very worst secrets in his life and those of his friends and family . .|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling dialogue but this movie has some really good lines and some very clever acting. It is worth your time if you like the old comedy classics and you will enjoy this movie as well as the rest of your movies. I really hope you can make some good use of it as it is quite good and it deserves a good watch. This movie has a great premise of an old lady with dementia who decides to make a movie of her life so as to be remembered.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. It’s remarkable in it’s simplicity and power. There’s no pretense. Nothing to say about what it represents or what it takes to get it. Just a beautiful story about one beautiful person, who finds her love for another, despite all the odds stacked against her. That is the power of art, of storytelling, and of a great story. This was a great story, a love story.|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
"David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary documentary from National Geographic

In late October 2011, a boat-load of us went on a boat trip out to the Great Barrier Reef. The boat pulled out of the harbour in Bribie Island, on Queensland's far west coast, into the open ocean, and into the calm waters of deep, cool waters. For four days we had to endure tropical heat and the open ocean for a week, then return to land, after a week of diving."|0
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a bunch of other guys ( McElroy ) while they try to stay one step ahead of the cops who are always on the lookout for people who can’t abide by the rules. It’s got plenty of laughs and plenty of action as well as some of Garlin’s best material. If you were going to make a comedy about cops, there’s little doubt that would be a good one, but how good is that comedy?|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1

Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he was talking with would do something like that. Ali is one of my favorite rappers of all time, but I was really dissapointed to see him act like that. He's a great rapper, and this is a shame for a lot of rappers who could've pulled off that. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for the whole rap industry. He should never act like this, and I'm sure he'll do more things like that down the road.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in 1972. The third feature, The Last Detail, was also featured in the film. Plot

At a military ceremony, the general's niece is presented with an ornate brooch as a marriage gift, to the delight of all. She asks her new fiancé to give it a name. After much searching, a name is finally found and given to her. In her excitement, she falls asleep and has a heart attack; she dies in her bedroom."|0
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more than likely , I would have been disappointed , but my disappointment didn´t last long! The movie is also very good ! I love the storyline , the story is interesting , and I am sure it will have lots of action scenes! I like the action scenes , it was really cool ! I am really glad I saw this movie , because it´s really good! This movie is just what I expected it to be , a good action movie which has good storyline and a good action sequence!|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it in the first place on the recommendation of a nice friend. The first act of the movie features the two men (and the one woman) traveling to Japan to visit a relative. During the movie we got to the point where we knew they were going to die. When it was mentioned to one of the travelers that one or both of the men will be going to the hospital in time for the birth of their children, we knew that they’re going to die.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the drama and heartache that has come down through the decades. This family has lived an extraordinary life , but has never been in such great physical or psychological danger. A beautifully photographed short film that shows some of the struggles of the human spirit. It captures the feelings of the parents and their growing family, and how their relationship with each other has evolved. A beautifully filmed film that captures the life and struggle of the family who has never moved away from their life's home.|0
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I felt like I was on The Honeymooners in my head, but I couldn't do anything but smile . I felt like a complete idiot, but didn't think I should be in this position. I should have paid attention to everything he said. I should have tried to answer his questions. And then I would have had to apologize. I should have made sure he understood that I would be taking his money, but that was not the case.|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a rock and roll novelty, but they did have a hit with a song called ‘Puss in Boots’ and they really did have a hit with a song called ‘Goodbye Yellow Brick Road’. They were a band in their own right from the start. In fact, the band were a pretty good band in their own right. Their sound was much more than just a rock band, but was also a lot of rock, pop and blues.|0
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series. I thought the quality was good, the story itself quite interesting , and there was plenty of laughs. However, it quickly becomes apparent that this is no longer the same thing, but rather, a very different show than the one I had first viewed. The characters are changed to a certain degree, but the basic concept remains. At no point during the episode did I feel as if I was watching something that was the real Outer Limit.|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian and Pakistani cinema aficionados. If you want to know the story of that night in a theatre in Seattle, you’ll just have to wait and read about it. I was fortunate to attend the festival as well. I was the only non Indian or Pakistani person in the auditorium and had plenty of time to chat with other attendees. I found it a fascinating experience for sure, and one that’s not too hard to understand.|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction was excellent , the acting was superb , the storyline was captivating , I would go to this movie for sure , even though it was a little over the top at times . The storyline was a bit corny , and I felt like I had to rewind a couple of times to catch up to everything . The acting was good , the screenplay was good . My favorite thing in the whole movie was when the characters were in love , that was really well done , and I enjoyed seeing that .|0
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this new Coop Movie ! This is my second time watching Clint Eastwood in a Coop Movie, and i must say that i liked this Coop Movie just fine , even though all the time i had to think about this new Clint Eastwood movies ! I don't know if i like Clint Eastwood as much as the first time around , because he is simply a different character here. I have seen him many times in several Coop movies, but I haven't really thought about him as a new Clint Eastwood.|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just about a girl trying to have a life , when she 's met a handsome guy with a different personality . The movie has great cinematography and a great story . It 's a classic which has never been shown in theaters in the USA ..It's not the movie I was expecting ..This is an interesting movie because the main character has a lot of issues .The main character in the movie is completely different when you first see him .But at the end, he becomes the most interesting character.|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little gem of a book I was struck by the author's ability to pull us all together in a world where everything seems so alien at first glance and yet all things are in their place and at the centre of their existence . The way in which the book portrays the lives of the people in that book and of those that come after them, as they are thrown out of place in a modern world is a brilliant depiction of how this world will change as we change as a nation.|0
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , I can do it . And with this little movie , I will try . But , I will not get the best of the plot . I was supposed to make it a comedy , not a thriller , but it will have a lot in common . I was told it would be the story of a woman who had lost her husband after he was kidnapped and brought to a remote location . The problem is , she would not be alone on this mission .|0
"This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is just so endearing . I love his character and how he makes everyone around him suffer .

I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde to life . It took away from the original version and added in a lot of extra stuff which I personally liked . Also added in some new additions . I do agree that this movie came out of nowhere and wasn't based on a book . That was something that happened in my generation . But overall I liked this movie . There was plenty of laughs and the film was very well done . Although some of the lines in the movie were in English .|0
"Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most of my friends didn't think this book was for them, but I think that's because they read it too late, they read it after they had already made their choices about their favorite characters. It's the kind of book that most of us can read a little early on in our high school years and think, ""This book is totally different than I expected it to be!"" I'm not sure that's a bad thing."|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched the world for a copy of it and finally found it on my shelf. It's an old movie but I have it and I am in love. It has all the charm and wonder of the best movies of the 1970's, the '60s, or any other decade of the past. It's just a great story told through the lives of these two women and how their lives intertwine with each other.|0
"We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had this movie playing in our room and I thought it was amazing. It was fun to see this movie. My husband and I saw it over the Christmas holidays and loved it! My favorite scene was when it was raining, and everyone in the theater said it was like rain all the time, so you could just sit there, soaking up the rain! I had a great time seeing it and I would definitely rent it again. 5 out of 5

`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers walking into an empty room to see how they might react when suddenly confronted with each other. And the music is great . So is the art. This is my first time ever listening to Blind Spot but I must say that this is my favorite track off of Blind Spot. If I could buy a copy of this album I would have it in my collection forever. This is a very interesting, well written, and thought out album.|0
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and I'm in the US ) but finally I got it. I was going to go with this one since my brother is going to be in it but since I am in Canada I wanted to watch it with my wife. I'll be honest, I was not expecting to like this movie since I've not seen the other one but I really did and I think it is pretty good too. My only criticism is that I thought the movie would have ended pretty quickly.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a doubt his most poetic filmic work to date. The fact that it has been turned into a two-disc DVD set is in itself an acknowledgement that the film was originally released in an extremely limited number of theatres throughout the world. As well, the DVD set has been released as part of the Werner Herzog Collection and as part of their DVD and Blu-ray exclusive release of the film as a Double Feature with Dune.|0
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs , it seems to me that it should be banned from the cinemas , as its not even really about sex . how do you do a film about a group of gay men in London and not have a gay character , how about a gay woman , a gay couple in love, or a gay mother and son , all of the above ? why is there always a lesbian or gay character in these films ?|0
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and fears. One morning in the middle of the city, she’s suddenly called to a place of great power. She’s summoned by a man who tells her about a secret she has hidden from him for years. There’s a secret that will change the world and change the way people treat each other in it. She’ll be able to bring peace and happiness into the world. And, when she does, no one will be able to resist her.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but also for its audience. In a time when a single album can be purchased for a few hundred dollars a copy, The Monkees proved themselves to be something of a cult classic and even more of a landmark than the band itself would have ever guessed. It might even have been more than that. After all, there was a Monkees documentary film made in 1969, released in 1975, and it's not too difficult to see why The Monkees have become an iconic brand.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if it were better but this is still one of the most watchable films I can think of. This is a thriller, where the main focus is on the characters, the plot line and the characters. This is one of my favorite movies. I would recommend watching it at least two more times, especially for the music, which I think is very good and adds a great dimension. I hope you have a chance to watch this. It's one of the best.|0
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is an awesome, fun and adorable playmate for my boys and a lot of other kids . AristoCats can sit on their own, come with them, or they can be placed on their owner's lap . They do not like to be picked up and are great at rolling over . When we first purchased AristoCats we did not like them very much because of the size . This size was a bit small for us and it was not the most attractive for AristoCat lovers.|0
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there weren't too many people in the room so it wasn't hard to miss a good portion of the episode . the episode was not very long . in fact I felt like i was watching it from beginning to the end with no breaks at all ! i am really disappointed that this isn't on HBO . this show has the potential to be something big . even though it was a little bit overrated , it had a lot going for it . this show is very smart .|0
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives, and the lives of their own families , have become quite commonplace in recent years, and the subject of a wide range of TV series , documentaries , feature films and even books. However, many of these shows have had their critics , with some, like the most recent episode of HBO's The Sopranos , finding fault with what they regard as the programme’s apparent over-emphasis on family relationships, with the result that many of the programmes in question are now banned in many countries.|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering of a friendship "" . Molly and Richard are both the products of extremely different families . One is a very rich, very poor family . They live at opposite ends of the spectrum . They are two very different people who find it all very hard to communicate . Molly is an art teacher . She`s had to leave her husband and all her children ...and move in with Richard , a successful businessman , in order to get on top of things."|0
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch and I was really interested in all the relationships between them. Bridgette Turner is such a delight in this film. I love how she's just so down to earth and I loved her relationship with Ben. Cara Delevingne's character was amazing , I really liked her in the movie and I loved the way her character was developed as I really like to see a character evolve into another person. Overall, great movie that is really entertaining to watch and well worth watching .|0
"* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . . ""I just saw you and heard your voice on the radio. I can't breathe . . . I can't breathe . . ."" These are just a few of the lines I would often repeat. It didn't really take me long to realize that being in the company of so many people like this made me very uncomfortable. On the outside I appeared to be a fun-loving goofball who loved to dress up in a silly costume with his or her own personal soundtrack."|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for music historians and fans. It provides an intimate view of the life of one of rock 'n' roll's most famous, enduring and influential performers. It traces the rise, early success, and later decline of 'Holly' from his earliest years in the early 1950s through to his death in October 1959 at the age of 37. The film also includes a rare interview with Buddy and his father, Tex, as well as a number of never-before-seen photographs.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect for the Holocaust films. It begins with a fascinating interview with Kahn, as we learn that it is he, not a real architect, who was the true architect of The Holocaust film. Architects, including Kahn himself, are often credited as being the creators of The Holocaust films, and even though it is true that he created the first film, it is highly likely that Kahn was the real architect, as he has created many more of these films as well.|0
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933 , a woman named Zasu Pitts wrote a bestselling book called The Man Who Had Everything. This woman was not a Hollywood star , or a rich socialite like Elizabeth Arden. She was a middle class housewife. Her husband was a professor of psychology at Columbia University who also had a successful publishing firm. Zasu Pitts was the most influential psychologist in America at the time. She was a great influence on the thinking of men like John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford.|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall you will enjoy it. I do not own any of the characters from it and you can use the name of any celebrities from the movie if you like. If you want to download full version or just the audio version of it you can just visit my link and go there to listen or download. You will see that the audio version has better sound quality than the one in the original video. This is a nice story to watch and the music used is also good!|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie starts to slow down a little, with the story becoming more focused and the character development beginning to show, although not quite all at once.As the movie picks up to its conclusion it picks up in pace a little, the story picking up nicely but the pacing picking up a little also.I really like the characters that have been created here, they are fun and funny and believable, it really helps that the writing is really strong too.|0
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least until it went out of business ) it has little or no commercial potential. It has never been a particularly popular game, although it was a great hit in Spain , and in France . In Italy , the game's reception was rather mixed , although there were some more favourable reviews. On its first release in Italy , as well as being sold in a limited number of copies, the game was only released in the Italian version of its own publisher , which has since gone out of business.|0
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series started filming. There was no studio filming and no one was shooting footage for anyone. You know when you see a Monkees movie or TV show and you say that the Monkees don't look like them? Well, the Monkees looked a whole lot like themselves. But they still looked like the Monkees. They don't look like them, they don't sound like them, they don't move like they do. They do things they do differently.|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce shows such as those by Joss Whedon, and then have them become successful on cable? It seems like there would have been no way that the networks could have prevented that from happening. In a sense, yes, and in a way that was never envisioned by the networks. The shows were just not that good at the start. That is why they became successful. In a sense I think Whedon's shows are pretty great.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines , the way they are written , you can just read it in your head , and it makes it so hard to watch. I don’t need to see it twice just to get the essence , the meaning , of what was written . And then , when they go on to say that , you realize that is just what is going to happen , even though that doesn’t seem to matter to anyone.|0
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . a very simple story where the hero and the heroine go through life with a lot of heartbreak and pain . as the film goes on it's very touching , touching and then it starts to get a little bit more intense and the tension builds . the movie starts out with a great story and then it becomes very intense . but the climax comes in the last 20 minutes in which the two actors , who played the main character , do something really nice and it seems to make the climax more intense .|0
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes of that film, I went into a completely different mental space , and felt like I had been sucked in to another dimension . the film is really good , and i would recommend it to people with a sense of humor or just for people with an open mind and a desire to see something funny . the fact that it was so funny makes this film a real gem of a film . this film is really not about a story .|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
"Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of the world. Sri Durga Chittidasa Devi: World of Consciousness

Sri Durga Chittidasa Devi is a popular spiritual guru of all India. She is in her early 60s, and is considered to be one of India’s great spiritual gurus by many. She began her public ministry in 1983, and has been working tirelessly for over 20 years to spread the teachings of God. She has devoted her life to the spread of the teachings of God amongst India, and has been very successful in this endeavor."|0
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the 1960s. It was directed by Yuji Mizusaki. The film deals with the life and times of a poet and artist from the Edo period (1600s–1868) to the post-war period. It also depicts the turbulent world of Edo during the Edo era, and focuses on the story of Kenji's life. The film is the first feature film to be based on the ""Miyazawa Kenji and the End of the World"" poem."|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following because it was one of my favorite movies I'd ever seen. But I had no idea what to expect because I had watched all the other movies on it and I couldn't find the movies I wanted. This time I wanted to try a more mainstream movie like the ones I usually watch or the ones my friends like. I wanted a movie like the one I always thought would be perfect for it. This DVD came in a huge box with about a ton of other movies.|0
"SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin's first appearance in _The Kid ,_ he has just arrived back from Europe . . . and he's about to get into a row . . . 'I can't see why you always have to do that . . .' But . . . it doesn't stop him, does it? As always with Chaplin, the momentary confusion was enough . . . _but not enough!_

Charlie Chaplin . . . The Kid."|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 2 is one of the best. It is not only the best, its the only one, as the other ones are quite poor and very weak. So, if you liked the first one or want to have a good one, you must have Death Wish 2. I know some of you think this is just a movie, but when you see Death Wish 2, you just cannot stop thinking about it. You think about the story.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a scientist who works with a group of gifted people. They come to him with a problem - they've all been kidnapped and they want to help solve the case. As they do they are pulled into a deadly game of crime & punishment - one that they must decide how they will react. But it is only on the first episode that we actually see the characters. So in the opening minutes, let's get some background on them all.|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and the people that I call ‘home’. I did see some parts of Athens , I went on holiday and the city looked very beautiful to be honest, I just never saw it through the eyes of an American tourist. I am so used to seeing the beautiful things that I see in Greece and I can’t help but feel that I’m seeing them through the eyes of someone who never left his country.|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them has its own set of problems and rewards. This game will be released only on PlayStation 3 as it has already been released on Xbox 360. The main story of the game involves three friends of yours who were separated for some time. As you will be able to tell when playing through, all three friends will be together for the first time in their life. The story of the game will be told through three different ways.|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the society of the 1930’s. I was amazed at how the blacks were treated with hate, violence and racism in the black community. The film shows the hatred between the blacks and the whites that was a part of the society in the past. The black community was divided between the blacks and whites that was a major part of the racial tension that was a part of the lives of most of the black citizens of the past. The movie was released in 1986.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on the road and try and find work so he can make ends meet. He has a hard time finding work. One night he goes on a mission with a group of his new friends and ends up being captured. Gus is kept in an abandoned building where he is tortured by the other prisoners and made to do hard physical labor. One day Gus gets up and escapes and tries to find his parents. He finds his way out and makes it to a new town.|0
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about a country that is not exactly known for theirs. There has been a lot of talk lately about the rise of violence on film with the release of Silence, a film with one of the most brutal acts ever committed by an audience member. I have no idea if this was true, I doubt it. I just thought I would write a blog about this film as a reminder that violence in film can come from anywhere.|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it first came out, and the movie was released in about 1995 . This film is one of those rare films where all three main themes are developed simultaneously . It's a fascinating film to watch . It's well made and the actors are well worth seeing . This is one of the finest films I've ever seen . It's so good and it doesn't need any special effects . The acting is fantastic . They all work so well together .|0
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Fiorentino , and Joely Richardson . In `` Separate Lies , ' ' '' the film follows an American woman ( Fiorentino ) traveling to Russia in the 1950s to meet her estranged brother ( Watson ) who she never knew existed. When they meet, she finds that she doesn't know what she has been missing in her life, a life she thought was over. She quickly discovers that it was only her past that never really ended.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of my favorites of their movies ! ! If you're not already aware, these people have a bit of fame to their name , and it isn't because they're big stars. They're a bit of a cult group and that's their way of spreading their influence around ! This is the story of how this group got the attention they did and how they came to make their own movies ! ! 1. What is the name of the group ?|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a knack for it, but this was more than just his ability to recreate the sound that was his specialty . The movie was directed by Norman Taurog, who knew and loved Buddy Holly and his band. I have to admit I was a little jealous of him when he did this movie . He is a good director . A good writer is not a bad thing . I saw the movie and had a good time and it is great to see it in HD .|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, but then making it impossible for him to stand for Staines because of that, we’ve made a serious mistake. The whole thing smacks to me of the very worst kind of double standards. The only person the Labour Party could have possibly considered as a future Staines Labour MP and who might, in time, be a candidate for Staines Labour in 2015 is Ali G who has never done anything wrong in life.|0
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better. It started off really cheesy , but it has a good point , as well as a great plot. It isnt a super serious movie and its not a horror/thriller . It is just a comedy/suspense film. I can't really explain why I enjoyed it , and it is probably because of it's title. Overall this was an awesome movie for the entire family . It is not a great family film.|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by far the most enjoyable and entertaining film of the year so far . As I said earlier it was pretty much all about how it was made and how I found it . The only negative thing that I found about it is that the director was not the same as in the previous film . Even though I enjoyed the previous two films it was quite different in its style . As for the plot I enjoyed the story of the film and what it is trying to portray .|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available on DVD here in the Philippines. I bought it in the Philippines and have seen it on video on my iPhone. So you can see the movie and read the reviews and then decide for yourself. For those that do not know about the movie, you may want to look it up online. This is the version that was released here in the Philippines. The other versions are out of the question here. If you have not heard or read anything about it, you can watch a trailer on youtube.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to watch this movie . I think that you should watch this movie in your lifetime . This movie has some good action scenes . The action is very exciting , it is good . The music is very good and it creates the feeling to the movie . This is a great thriller movie . The story is simple and it has a lot of action scenes . It is interesting and interesting . The plot is complicated and it is interesting . I think that this movie is very interesting .|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen. In some cases we would rent and then watch that movie, other times we would rent and watch a special edition movie. One of the things I am most impressed with about Netflix and how it has taken the world of movie viewing by storm is how well they have integrated the world of television with their service. It's not that I don't enjoy television but in my experience I have found that it is only a small fraction of people who do so.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is based on the novel I Am Legend by Stephen King , the story of an anti-hero who must fight to protect his daughter from a killer . The movie is in two parts . the first half is told in a single story with only one set of characters (the protagonist is played by John Lithgow in this part of the movie) . But in the last few minutes we see a new cast of characters introduced to the story.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , whose father is dying . He's just trying to make it through high school . His life's mission is to find out the truth about Reggie's father so he can get revenge . He wants to get rid of his father to show his mother he's a bad son . Reggie gets in the middle of the situation and the film doesn't tell you the story of what happened that day . Instead the film just says it happened .|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it could have been much better and much much worse. This was the second film that had me wondering if it was ever gonna be released. It had all the makings for a great classic. The whole thing is like a great adventure story, set in a place with a very strange past and present that just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. The plot was pretty simple, a young woman goes to this town that seems to be run by a secret society.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening feature film for the festival and the movie was well received by all who saw it, including the audience there. As a side note, I was able to get the movie from the festival’s official site and I think they are very nice people. If you would like to buy the DVD you can order it here. As usual I’ll give the links of the reviews from the festival but I’ve included the ones that you’ll want to look at.|0
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be said . I have always loved this season and have always wanted to create a set of scenes around the main characters . I am going to try and recreate them with a slightly different approach and hope you will enjoy them ! If I am doing it correctly I am going to try and reproduce the story of Jesus, Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus ! If any of you have any questions or suggestions please let me know .|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited, because they thought it was going to be awesome. They thought it had a great story, a great premise, and so many great actors and actresses. Some even thought that it would be one of those true-to-life true-crime dramas that you can't believe existed! Now, I have a sneaking suspicion that you're thinking ... well, the trailer didn't actually tell a story. That trailer was just a trailer.|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes with the soldiers to get a better place to live, but he ends up joining the army on the spot. Charlie starts to fight with the soldiers and ends up becoming a sergeant with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in WW I. The film tells the story of Charlie and his two friends who want to enlist to go to war. Although they do not know how to fight in war yet, but they are still in their twenties, and they are determined to do their duty.|0
"Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I have seen every film in this trilogy, and now that there is a sequel, I'm sure I'll see the rest of the trilogy just to see how well it works with the other two . Quote:

If there was any doubt before I finished watching this film, I will never let go of this. It's so good. It's a perfect film, it's a masterpiece that deserves to be in the top ten films of all time."|0
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one corner to another of her mind. And there she sees him. He is, in fact, there. She does not know who or where, but he has been watching her. He is a man. He is tall and slim and a little too young for her. Yet, as she looks on him, she knows that he is well-formed, and well-built, and that he is handsome, and strong and confident. At first she finds him attractive.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (2009) which also happens to be a film from this year’s summer’s edition of Fantastic Fest. So, as always, it’s the second time we’ve been invited to write for the blog but the previous film we wrote for was probably the most notable entry in this series of shorts. I thought a little more of it before we did, though, since this is a series where the film is the central character, you see.|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Patrick and Sanders which are very well done , are well done , and there are some great scenes between the two actors . Blackmer , on the other hand , lacks the energy and energy that Sanders has , and in this film , that is not a good thing to do. Sanders is excellent , and the other two are good , and are better than Sanders and Blackmer . If this were a Hollywood movie , this film would get a lot of money and awards .|0
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a fun movie! You can get a copy of the video right here! This is one movie you don't want to miss! If you have enjoyed my videos and want to see more go here to get more of this kind of content. I will be making more videos in the next few months and you can see them on the site. This is my first movie, and I was impressed by how well it turned out.|0
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of the DVD , it's not perfect but the production is professional ,the story is original, the acting is excellent, the production quality is very good and the ending is very exciting ! The movie is about a criminal who wants to kill his brother , when he comes across his brother's corpse , he realizes it's time for him to put his past behind him , as he wants a new life. But when he meets a beautiful woman he wants to make a new beginning with.|0
"I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down on google, but I can only find a couple sites that still host it. I was wondering whether any of you had any links on that site? If not, would be interested in seeing if it can still be viewed, or if it is now on Youtube.. thanks

I am sure I have heard about this being shown on the BBC but no one knows what the name was? A few people I have asked seem to know the name but cannot remember the movie name."|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , then I am here to make a suggestion. Why not create and post a poll for us to vote for the best films you have ever watched and we will share it with everyone on the internet and let them decide who is best. So go ahead and vote for the films you have the most enjoyed . I know there are many and I am sure you will enjoy. To vote for best film you have ever watched, simply answer the simple question.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the second season and I think this is an episode I am going to miss the next two seasons . I love Columbo and I loved this one , but it was just too bad it had to be cancelled . I know many of you who saw it agree that the finale was very disappointing , and it was just too bad that they cancelled it . This was the worst Columbo season ever , I can't stand the characters , it's just too bad they couldn't make it more suspenseful .|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
"When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - that is why they are called warlords. The word 'warlord' means 'one who is a conqueror of someone else, especially the Romans', and that is exactly what the Valkyries bring. And if they do not bring gifts, then there is no war , no warlord for the Valkyries."" So we're left with the fact that the Romulans brought gifts as well, and we'll have to go back in the archives and look at the war that was fought."|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . you would be right . but then you have the people that say it and say what it means . and I don't think it could be said any better . I can't say for sure , but I can say this : I like the first half , and I like the second half , 
 I don't believe there is any third . but I don't think this is one of the better ones , 
 but I can't say it has any flaws , either ."|0
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over four and a half hours , it is more than twice that long. He did not get around to making another film for a while. He was busy shooting his next film. The story is about a man called Tom, a gangster who runs a criminal organization. He is in love with an Indian woman called Zina. One night, Tom is shot. Zina comes to his side. She is in the clutches of an Indian man. He is called Priti.|0
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face for the entire time , and I was in total and utter delight with the way everything was done , I could just watch it all over again and again , and I don't even care about the movie anymore ! I am still in shock that I have seen this movie today , I will never, ever forget that movie ! I didn't think I was in the mood to see a movie when I first saw this, but it was worth it to me.|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I haven't seen it ) so I'm looking forward to it . I know this is not a movie you will be able to watch for several weeks because of the content , but that's OK . You may be aware of this movie and may not, but I've never heard of it. I guess this is a movie that I'm not sure about because I have not heard of it. I think I will watch the movie tonight and I will be interested to see what you think of it.|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful film, which has just been released in select theaters. The movie is based on an actual case where a young girl was murdered in the early 1980s and her body was found in a ravine in the South Bronx. The case went cold until just before Christmas 2000, when the authorities discovered that the body was part of a larger set of remains. The investigators then began digging up the rest of the bones.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
"I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , they don't seem to do a lot of work. They don't help you understand what is being described. For instance, it would help in the following example:

In this context , it might help to refer back to the previous paragraph , because there are some important facts to be noticed here . Also , a visual sub-reference might help , but I think it doesn't do much good in this context . In fact , I find them quite useless in general ."|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful story set in the early 1960s in the fictional nation of Arrakis, or Arrakis Prime, and told in the words of its inhabitants. It’s set in a future where the government has turned Arrakis into a “superstate,” but the citizens, the Arrakis Prime citizens, and the people of Earth are just beginning to realize the true nature of the Arrakis Prime government and what will become of their country, once the superstate is established.|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have had a violent temper , but who is not a criminal , he is just a simple guy who does odd jobs to try and make his way through life. The others are the perfect husband , father of three beautiful kids. The most evil twin however , he is just as good as the others . This movie has been a favourite for decades , but it did not catch on with American audiences until a few years ago. It's a classic Columbo .|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who has to read , and A girl with her own show. Its a really great show . I am going to go and see it tonight , and i am so excited. The guy was really great . There were some really great shows on the American Idol season 8. I really like them all. I have to say though that my favorite was this season. This was the best American Idol season ever for me. I will definitely watch American Idol live again.|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II might not have much of interest to someone who doesn't know the background of the subject. But after watching it I've come to believe this was an important film because of the subject, and that it was worth seeing despite the lack of character development and plot twists, but more importantly, because of the sheer power of a movie set in the Italian occupation - it's something you have to see if you want to.|0
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that is headed to Japan in order to find his parents. He meets his best friends and begins dating. But as Tweety goes from day to day, he doesn't see his own parents for who they truly are. This makes Sylvester feel isolated. But he also realizes how much he's missing the family he used to live with. He begins to look for them but can't make any headway until he starts to make friends and finds himself in the middle of a game.|0
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not interesting. This film is more of an actioner than you might expect , especially considering that the director has previously done some martial arts movies . After a couple of brief scenes in the opening sequence , we get a little of this , a little of that , then the film moves on to a slow, tense sequence that sees the protagonist slowly being killed by an unknown force . I won't lie, it's a little hard to watch , and the ending doesn't come out as planned.|0
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1

I was very excited that I was able to attend this festival."|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with all of them. There is no one in the film who has made me want to shoot him. It was very depressing to see the man who caused so much evil and pain to so many people . I did not have a problem with the man in the film. If you go to the movies, you don't see a lot of movies about people shooting the wrong man because they are jealous of the woman he is with.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at the teen/tween audience. Which, as the movie progresses, becomes more interesting and relevant for older audiences. The movie takes place in one long day as a boy and his dog explore the woods. They meet a couple that are walking through the woods too, they have no clue as to why they're in the woods until they get closer to them. They meet up with the couple. The boy is a girl and the girl is a boy.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother, My Sister, Me! episode and a few others on there soon), the movies are all good. It would be nice if a film could be reviewed in a way that would let us know which movie is which. And that's just about all I can do. But there are a few movies out there worth looking at. The only one I am going to touch on at the moment is Titanic.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his most likable in this effort. He's a man with a plan in mind. But his plan has a tendency to get sidetracked. He comes into his office, sits down at his desk, and starts talking to himself. And we know what comes next. The film is full of laughs and laughs and laughs. And there's not a wasted second of it. There are a lot of laughs. All the action in the story is so entertaining that even the serious stuff isn't half as interesting.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was used so much for the scene on the boat with the pirates. This film is not as well done as 's 's but for me it was quite enjoyable. The story line is a bit cheesy and John Garfield's performance is just average at best. The film is just a tad on the expensive side. My only quibble is that there are no more than five of them, yet the plot is a tad too complicated.|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , this film might be considered to be in the last third of the film . This is not to say , that there is not more to it than what appears here. The opening scene , which sets the tone for the entire film , was shot in two shots. One , the first shot , is quite short , and the second , the second shot , which is quite long . There are shots , and it is clear , what we are being shown here .|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald (Richard Roxburgh) is married to one woman and has three children. One is his biological son. The other 2 children are his adopted younger brothers. They live in the country. He has an old shed in which they live and he has a garden which they tend. The children are all in a terrible state. His wife was a drunk and has been for about 10 years. The children also have a terrible state.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be quite believable. If you are seeking a bit of humor that could not be better than the movie, I highly recommend the movie. As I was reading the book I found that it was too dark for my tastes. The story was a little too dark. It does not make for a good summer read, I would suggest the film version, but if you are interested in movies with a bit of a story to it, this is the right film to rent.|0
"Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest to an almost unbearable level . A great watch . A must see . The Man Who Planted Trees

For years, there has been some controversy over the question: “What do we eat?”

If you are not familiar, it seems the question has become something of a rallying point for the ecological movement. For a few years, the question was mostly rhetorical. It seemed as though the environmental movement was a dying breed."|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you are interested in the story I suggest you watch this movie . You will find a great movie for sure . You have the right to have fun in this film . This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. The story is very entertaining but it's not really that great. In the end it doesn't work, and I find that this movie is far from a masterpiece of cinema . If you are interested in watching a great movie , this film should be avoided .|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about my dad and how his death affected him and how it impacted his entire family. It was so touching and powerful, I was able to give him the support, love and acceptance that he deserved and more importantly, received. We are all dealing with loss and this documentary gave me a true perspective on it. Thank you David for this documentary and I hope it has a positive impact on people like me. I will continue to look for others and learn how to make my own life easier.|0
What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here is why I think its time to reevaluate this season, not just because its the end but because the season as we know has been pretty mediocre. There is no such thing as an overrated team or a team that is an average or below average team that we can really look back and evaluate by looking at their record and stats. What you can look back at is the way they play and their performance when they're at their best.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
"Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD go in that direction ! If you have a script and you don't know how to script , there's no way you can say it should go like that , or it should start in a certain place. The script you have should have something to it :

- How many actors should I have ? - How many scenes to it ? - Does it have to be funny ? - Does it need to be an action movie ?"|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially from US , then this film is going to change your life. Because in this film this female character is the main character. And this is a story of this female character with the help of her father . As you may already know the movie ‘The Fault in Our Stars”, which was released by the Weinstein Co, has a male lead in it. But this movie has female lead . And as this movie is coming out, the male lead is being a popular topic.|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which the artists are put to by the film industry. It is indeed a great thing to see the artist in his natural environment . However , due to the fact that chihaweseon has a small budget , many of his movies have not been of such a great quality as others of his peers . Although many movies about the artist in his real environment are not as bad as his peers , they are indeed not as good as a movie that would be in the industry .|0
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid was acting in this movie , and when I was a kid I was always watching cartoons . I thought this movie could be a movie for a 10-year-old kid . I loved it ! So I thought it would be fun . So I decided to read the entire movie to get to know what was going on . Once I got through , I was very interested in how the story unfolds and who was doing the acting .|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was excited when she announced the new season of 30MM. After all, I'm not the type to sit in my house and do nothing but wait for the season to be out. Luckily for me, I had a very understanding wife. I could tell she was going to be upset when I was not present when she came to the house the night before the premiere of season six and showed me the new episode of Rachael's show.|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to write music for his own films . After a few years in Hollywood , he returned to his hometown of Memphis , Tenn. to direct , produce , and write . In his first year of directing , he began to write the score . A couple of years later , he had written and produced , directed , and scored his first feature film , the low-key comedy about a high-school football player in a small South Carolina town .|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a young male protagonist was something that would be quite unusual for Italian cinema. In many respects, the films of Fulci are almost always considered to be part of the Italian film tradition and one of his most famous films in this regard is the highly underrated The Bicycle Thieves. The film is a love story set in the 1920s in which an artist, Giovanni, falls in love with and marries an American woman named Mary.|0
"These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star and 2) an all-American boy band who's name is Michael Jackson. For a while now , people have been wondering, ""Where did that Michael Jackson kid go?"" Nowhere, apparently. Apparently , Michael Jackson fans are just like everyone else in the world -- and they don't like to hear that the guy they grew up with is no longer with us. In fact , they hate that he's gone, which is why some people are just now getting back to him."|0
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Loose '' ) , this one tells the story of a small-time con man ( Marlon Wayans ) and his efforts to get the money he needs to take care of his ill father ( Raymond Burr ) and his mother ( Marjorie Reynolds ) , as well as to support his aging parents' ( Charles Derry and Doris Nolan ) failing businesses. This is the only one of his four films to have been shot on 35mm.|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - it's just a good story. This movie is one of our favorites! I can say this much - if you're a WWII buffs you must see it! I really hope it's still on at your local theater. The movie is quite well researched and the production value is top notch. I'm a little confused about one thing though. I think he said that they were planning on showing it at a local community theater but no such place is listed online or in the movie.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put a human face on an often controversial issue and make for good viewing. You can see why it's a risky move for Disney to release the film now. But it may have been a wise one at the time, and it's a chance for Disney to show the world it has the ability to adapt a story about race into a movie (or a sequel) that's not so overtly about racism, at least as portrayed in movies.|0
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like films from any medium , need an atmosphere . You need a mood. A visual and auditory environment that supports the content , and helps develop the audience's emotional response to it . As the title suggests , one of the most effective moods of the recent summer is The Last Days of Disco , which was released during the summer of 2005. The premise of this movie was that a teenage boy had gone on a camping trip in the woods, and had fallen in a sinkhole, and died .|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes some time to see what is going on, and some time is a great deal , and this time I was not bored . I watched this movie , and then I went to my local video store and rented it to see what it is about . The movie is based on a book that was written in 1994, and is titled The World Is Flat. It is a film about how the Earth was flat, and that we live on a round Earth .|0
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a struggling filmmaker in the Italian film scene. He had begun his career as a director of documentaries and then became an independent filmmaker. After he released his first feature film and was quickly acclaimed, he signed on for his own film. The Beyond won him a nomination for an Academy Award as best original short film. His third film, Zombie, went on to win an Academy Award and a BAFTA as best foreign film.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
"First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I didn't care for the film , but the way he did it was very believable , and the way it was acted was pretty darn good . But , let's put it this way , ""The Squid and the Whale "" is a little over rated , and to put it another way, I don't think this is the kind of movie you will go to see . The way it was shot , is very realistic , but to me , I think that the story itself was kind of pointless ."|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and interesting career. When this movie was released in late 70's I was a fan of Buddy Holly - I would love to go to his show or see this movie when he played in front of a crowd - I would love to go to see him playing live and play with him in front of the crowd and see all of his music. The movie was a good movie but it is too long and I only got to see about a quarter of it...|0
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz is a pretty good pianist but it would have taken a lot for her to stand out there in her own performance. I did not hear a lot of what the audience was saying . I did not expect much of it . I think it was the same thing every night, that it was a good show . I could not believe how loud it was. I liked the movie . The story lines were good , and I did not expect it to be as bad as it turned out be.|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
"I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that it's been out for about 12 hours now, and if I haven't already made my opinion clear on that...

As I watched this episode today I was surprised by how much I was enjoying it. It wasn't a show that you have to watch for the whole 12 hours it takes to watch, but to me it had everything I needed to watch. There's no shortage of good things to talk about in this episode."|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and her team. If you didn’t know already , you shouldn’t , this film is called “Mystery Train” and tells the story of a girl who finds a train at a train station , finds a boy she likes , who she has only ever seen through the window , then meets another boy that she finds in the train and finds out he has a twin. This film also has another train story in the background, if you like that , then you need to go watch this.|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that takes place in the early 20th century America during WWI and tells the story of two men who are stationed in France. They end up in a position that they do not understand, and it is not what either of them expects. They meet the girl of the house in the village with their families , they go to the village and they meet a new friend there. A beautiful girl with dark black hair and dark black eyes , a man who knows who she is but she seems to hide it.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
"Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with a nice sense of humour, it is a well received and well acted feature by the director. Tuesday, January 24, 2005

The End of My Story

On Tuesday the 24th of January at Coalville's Century Theatre, there will be a short screening and discussion about a British film that was recently broadcast on ITV2 . The film , called ""The End of My Story"" was first shown on ITV2 on the 12th of October , the day after its broadcast."|0
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any better ? This is not like the movies in the 80s , and it is not the 80s in the way that a great movie is about a story. If you haven’t watched it, then go and see it, otherwise, you’ll go mad. So , my question is why are people so adamant to complain? Did you not watch it? And I will tell you , it is not a good movie. I found it dull and boring.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I don’t see it. I mean there’s a great scene of Eddie and Bob getting into an argument, which is so over the top that I’m sure it was shot at a studio where it’s not allowed. But I don’t think they’ll make the sequel because they were too afraid of pissing people off over Bob & Eddie’s relationship. I’ve been watching this series since its inception in 1994.|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've said before on this forum I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. He was one of the primary inspirations and influences for the character of Dr. Doolittle. His works were very influential to me as I grew up with him. I'm not sure he'd have liked the movie, so I'm not going to spoil it, but if you like his stuff and would like to see his works, this is a fun little film.|0
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock star Frank Zappa. It has a good pace that doesn't bog down but it's a shame the writing isn't a little better and the acting is so mediocre that you wonder why they thought it was worth paying the extra $10 to watch. The thing about Zappa is that you can be pretty sure that this movie was made in the late '60s or early '70s because the music from this movie sounds like it was made at least a few years before that time period.|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times, even though we never met or talked to one another. I have a lot of memories of this movie, from the first scene to the end. It was a really good movie and worth the price. It is one of those films I would love to watch again now and I think you get what you pay for, but for those who are looking for something a little different, this was worth the cost. I am going to be watching this one many times again .|0
"When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. I thought it was a fascinating mix of comedy, drama and action. Now that it’s been out for some years I’m rewatching it with my friends to get to know it again, and this time a lot more. I’m going to try and give a couple of impressions of this one. The Plot:

What I’m going to say is, this is not a really interesting film to watch."|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
"Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is the original from some guy who is in his mid-60s, but is probably older than that.It's really good. ""I believe the people who try to tell me what to do are the people who will never let me forget how good they were. ""- George Carlin

This movie is fantastic. It has everything you could want from a movie, from the acting, the story, the pacing, the music, the cinematography, the special effects, the direction of the action...and the acting."|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
"If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) in decades, from writer/director Mario Bava , produced by Cinecittà Films ( Italy ), distributed by Columbia/Sony ( USA ) ( Italy ). Director and star Mario Bava , born in Varese , where his mother worked as a nurse , is not a native of Rome . He studied drama in Turin for four years , graduating from the prestigious Liceo Classico in 1973 , before moving on to Rome where, as he recalls, ""I wanted to do theater, but then I became interested in movies."|0
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , the film was an essential part of cinematic history, and even today , the film still speaks a powerful truth. I have always felt that if you want something to be remembered, you should not give it away. Not for free or cheap. The film was not only a work of art, the story is still remembered and still relevant today. That's true. But if you don't want to watch it, it's easy enough to find a copy on line .|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona of the self-deprecating, wacky, and, of course, funny guy is an actor that we can all relate to. And yet Garlin’s film doesn’t seem to be trying too hard to connect with us. In fact, Garlin lets us know exactly why that is by doing exactly what he does best . He directs the film, and lets us know that the film exists in a very real world.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage. I was wondering if there is any video that I could download that will show this effect. If there is then I'll put the link here. Thanks in advance. Well I would imagine that most people would have already seen the concert footage. So, if you wanted to go and watch the concert, you would probably have to wait a bit, or maybe not, depending on how long you saw the video.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew on the surface of a world in which time has become warped. At the same time that the humans are on board the ship, we are shown a view of the planet, the surface is covered with mountains, forests and a vast river system, which flows from the mountain ranges of the land. There are two types of creatures: one type live in caves and are covered with fur and the other live in trees and have very sharp teeth.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
"This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot , all the guns and explosives and a great cast to go along side . It was great fun . I loved every second of it . Great movie . I could watch it all day . If you liked this movie you should buy a copy of this DVD

Watch the movie. It's fun, action-packed, and completely ridiculous. When I was a child I had just seen The Godfather II with a lot of my friends. When my wife was a teenager she had seen that movie as well."|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
"This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are great. I recommend it for sure . But there are quite a few flaws . One major flaw that I would want to say is there is no music in the movie , just the voice of the one guy. But the movie has some great music . The music is great and the movie is just awesome. So I am telling everyone to watch this movie ! It is a must see ! ************

It is very well acted ."|0
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be talking than acting . I think this is the reason I always watch his movies . The only time I can see a 'd like him is when he takes the character seriously . In the movies, he is always good at playing a serious guy . I can't say I have seen too many that are good at it . John Barrymore always makes me smile . Maybe that is because he always looks so nice and sweet . He never seems as silly and 'd play up to his role .|0
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written by the man responsible for the best-selling film adaptation of the novel , composer John Adams. Adams wrote the original book and provided the music for the film's original cast , while Hunter 's version was written as a companion piece for the original film . This is the final of five installments chronicling the life of the film's main character. Hilton's beloved book is considered by many critics to be among the finest works of fiction ever written.|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) at the chateau of Chambord, Jean-Baptiste becomes a member of a band of assassins sent to assassinate him. The plot thickens when Duvalier is killed in the midst of his own assassination attempt when he is caught by his mistress, who then attempts to force her husband into suicide. The plan goes awry and he is killed in cold blood by the band of his own assassins, who take over his private chapel, and bury the body. Jean-Baptiste is sent to the guillotine for his crimes.|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone-on-tone piece that brings to mind an old Hollywood film noir. In the mid-1990s, in the wake of 9/11 attacks, Golden Door was awarded a BAFTA and Golden Globe for the Best Film in the Best Foreign Language Film categories. Although the title is a play on words, it is actually the title of one of Godard’s two previous films, Chocolat (1991) , which is loosely based on the life of a French pastry chef in the early years of the French Revolution.|0
"1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the assassination of the owner of a local restaurant, and the ensuing confrontation with his wife, which leads to a showdown with the gangsters. History

The book was published by Harper in October 1933 as The Crooked Circle; it was republished in 1975. Plot 
It begins with a man and his wife, who are going through a bad marriage. As they are driving away from a restaurant in the city, they are stopped by two men."|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a young woman in a bar. The news of his attack has gone largely unnoticed in his native Romania , even though he had committed the same offence in his own country several years prior. But the Romanian media have picked up on this latest case , and have gone into overdrive trying to find a motive for the brutal assault. On the one side , there are the usual suspects – ‘murderers, paedophiles’.|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very well paced and made us care about the characters in the storyline . The cinematography is excellent and the soundtrack is good as well . Just overall a great film , it had a great story to tell . This was a great film. It was well paced and had a good story to tell. It is not my favorite, but it certainly wasn't the least bit inferior to some of the other excellent, well made horror films.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The story is set in the English countryside at the beginning of the 20th century and centres on the lives of a group of women who live in a village. It is based on the true events and experiences of these women during a time when there was no other film to tell their story . This film has never been released in the US but was released to the UK . The film has won numerous awards and was screened at the 1968 Berlin Film Festival .|0
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you want to watch a classic Hollywood action movie , then this may not be for you. If you are wondering why a classic Hollywood action movie is considered a fake Hollywood movie, then I will explain. The fake Hollywood action movie is based in a movie genre which has become popular over the last decade , and this movie genre is known as the action flick . The film industry has produced several Hollywood movies in this genre .|0
"Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also has a good point, we don't know anything about Stingers so it's not just a ""what does this guy think he is?"" kind of show with no answers or explanations. I'm glad that they did a rewatch of all their previous recordings, so I don't need to hear some of the stuff I already know, but they also need to have a few surprises, not the usual ""This is not what he said in the first episode"" surprises."|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it. And it has. It is a classic, for a reason. I was a child at the time and I had no understanding of what I was seeing or what it was. I didn't understand that this movie was what people did. That it was a story about a family, about a community, about a society. And the message was that all people have value and that they should be looked after. And what they did was that they raised children that were different.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very beautiful film, and is worth watching, if only for its special effects. In Snow White , for example, we are given some very beautiful shots of the mountains, such as these:









Here, we are not given any special effects or special effects for Cinderella, Snow White, or Bambi, but I can understand how some of you might not like seeing those shots, and would rather see more of just the scenery. It is a matter of taste."|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay series . What's really great is the fact that this is just a really great series . The story is so clever . There's a lot of suspense in this story , and it has just been very well written . One of my favourite characters in this story is the girl whose name is not really given . She doesn't have to have a name , but the way she's described in the book means that you can picture her .|0
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. “Lucky in love, lucky in death,” the song goes. And you know what they mean. The song has been a constant companion of mine since first hearing it as a girl in the early ‘90s. Buddy Holly’s death on the day he was born, July 17, 1957, was a turning point for me, a turning point for his fans, and the entire music industry.|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully moving film. But even though it's so beautifully done, this movie doesn't even pretend to tell the entire story. All the characters are just stereotypes, and that's how I felt as a child watching it. There was only one main character, who was a doctor. That's it. It didn't tell the story of how an alien lifeform landed in our home, how it found us, where it came from, and why it took so long for us to notice it.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris

She lives there and is fed on special cat food in her own home. But she doesn't know she is being fed cat food. It all began for her when her owner sent a gift of food and toys to the Duchess of Windsor who was staying in Paris for a few weeks. The gift arrived when the duchess was in her late 50s, but she hadn't realised. The food was sent to her as a birthday card."|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 at the time and her first major role was as the young woman who was hired at a brothel. It's not that she was bad at her job, she just didn't know any better. In the end she was just too young to be an adult and too innocent for her role, but she was a good person who just needed help. I love this girl and she is an amazing dancer.|0
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is trying to tell us with this film ,and with the story he is telling about his life and his relationships and what he wanted to accomplish in life . i think its great ,i just find it hard to watch it because i dont see any of the characters , or the story , i feel it is more of a film for teenagers than for adults , i just think it is too much of a movie for me to watch .|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell you the events leading to his capture. After his capture the story continues and ends with him being brought back to the present as a hostage in an effort to find a way out of his situation. This was an interesting game to review and I enjoyed it greatly. The characters were well-drawn, the sound was immersive and the level design was top notch. The only problem I found with the level was that I found it a bit repetitive.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause it comes out at the end and i cant wait to see the whole thing again . this movie is the best of all time . i like it . i cant wait to see this again ! I've seen it on DVD, and the one and only thing you have to do is read the whole thing so i can tell if it sucked or not. If you don't watch it you're gonna have a rough time. What an awesome show!|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of this movie before it came out. It was about a young guy who is married to his ex and is in the process of getting another woman. While the wife was out with their friends, the ex and their friend came home and took the wife into a room to make out. This guy and the wife had no idea where the other was, and they didn’t know whether they were married to each other or just friends.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1

"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
"The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that it has been released in the form of a short film rather than a feature film . This was the first movie that I saw with an audience of my relatives and I found it quite difficult to judge the acting , story and cinematography from a distance. I was not disappointed in the movie . Plot :

It starts at night , a night of joy and pleasure , a night full of joy, when a man falls in love with his friend, a girl , who is very beautiful."|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched it when I got it to the theater in the US and I was shocked to see that it wasn't all over the screen like it was in the US . It seemed to move pretty much at its own pace and not have any sort of time lag , which makes me feel as though its a real good movie that you should not pass up. One thing is for sure this movie would have been way better if it was longer .|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps the audience engaged from the start. The main characters have a great amount of screen time (the main couple is very cute) but you don't need to pay attention to anything, the actors are excellent and this movie is fun for both women and men. You will be able to see yourself on screen at the same time. It is a good comedy that is well-written and acted and the story is good and well-acted by the main actors.|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original plot and characters that are fresh and entertaining. This film is filled with characters who you are not familiar with at all and you feel comfortable with them all. The film has a great amount of comedy, a few romantic scenes and you are treated as a regular character in it. The movie is filled with action and excitement and you are not put in an awkward position in it’s plot. The action scenes here are great.|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
"If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved, and it has to be explained how to do so. There are a number of ways, and it may seem tedious and complex, but the only thing that is necessary for it to work is to give yourself a few extra lines of code that have to do a lot of work:

.. code:: lua

   function Separate()
     -- This is what we have right now, but it seems a bit over complicated. -- I don't know of a good way to put this in."|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film. I loved the music from the film. I thought it was great and so I wanted to see the film when I grew up but I was so young at that time to have that dream. As I got older I watched the film twice because I thought it had some great action scenes and it was great to see how amazing the film looked and how much the film was filmed. I watched the film on video.|0
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
"* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys have no idea how it ends... The Last One

Season 1 Episode 7

It started as a surprise, and then it became a foregone conclusion. It was that easy. I just had to have it. I knew what the ending would be. I knew what I'd be seeing. I knew who the good guys would end up. But as the episode came to an end, there was nothing left to say, no reason to explain why it could be so easy."|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this movie prior to its release, which made me feel that I was in the minority of those who had actually liked the film. After watching the trailer , the first time, I found it a bit bland, with an overly simplified story that did nothing to add any excitement to the rest of it. This time around , it is a very different experience. This is a completely fresh, original story, and not a rehash of other, better works.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Told in the style of a mystery movie, but with no mystery the movie is very well written. I like mystery movies and this movie is my first mystery movie. The story is very well made and interesting. The characters in the story are not in the movie for the sake of the story. In fact they are very important to the story and I like to have that in the movies. The plot in the movie is simple, but at times confusing, which can be confusing for a first-time audience.|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . It's about a woman that has cancer who becomes the love interest to a guy who is diagnosed with the same type of cancer. You can see all of the actors in this movie, and most of them were from the past. The director of this movie is a woman from the 90's so I have no idea why it made it back. It's a nice film . The story is a bit of a cliché, but that's what I would expect from a movie like that .|0
"After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to give myself a challenge to find more of them. I did that and I found a second pack of The Aristocats for sale. These are the second batch I've found so far. They are being offered for $7.99 on Amazon and I have had the opportunity to test them out. Here's what I think about these:

I liked the idea of The Aristocats on the first two editions of this book."|0
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it more if I had been at the theater with my partner , but she didn't see it so that was not the reason for my enjoyment . I think they are looking to take the franchise back in time a little, I don't know what they will do, but it's interesting that it's done so early and with such a short story. If it was longer and with a good conclusion it would be worth the watch , but in this case it doesn't fit in.|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original rock ‘n roll stars of the ’70s, but I’d never heard of ‘em until I heard about the new “Monkees” TV show. The first thing that came to mind when watching the new series is this : “Well, what did they do before the ‘Monkees?’” To me, “Monkees,” though not quite “rock ‘n roll,” was still the quintessential “rock” group from the ’40s, and the show certainly does their homage justice.|0
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in and out of each other. But what happens when you fall in love with a guy who does not look as handsome as you do and is just as smart as you? I was disappointed to not see that in the story. It was refreshing to know that there is a way to fall for a guy with a different personality than your own, even if he’s a bit less than your equal in terms of intelligence.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could possibly want from a holiday movie. It's well made, has great special effects (the most impressive thing about it), a really funny script, and has a really touching story. The actors are really nice, the special effects are pretty impressive, the acting is all great, and the plot is just great. My only complaint is that it takes quite a while to get to the end and I wish they would have at least slowed it down a bit more.|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say this is a great film. I've never seen anything like it and if I was able to, I'd definitely buy it in a minute. I've already bought all the extras I could get my hands on which includes a DVD, book and an audio. If you want to buy the DVD, be forewarned that it only has 2 hours of extra footage so you may have a long wait. You'll be waiting a while for that.|0
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . If I was asked , I couldn't say anything else. I was so moved by his performance . I was amazed at how he portrayed a human being . His character was so realistic . I can say , he didn't portray him as some kind of monster but as someone living a normal life . I don't think I am exaggerating by saying it was the most memorable performance I have ever witnessed . There are people who say this is only a role but I say it is true .|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for it for a bit and I have found it so far. I have found some other pictures in this forum that are not so good. I was hoping to find some decent quality pictures to replace them, but now I think I have to look on other forums for these pictures. I would love to find a really good copy of the same picture that I found for free on the net. Please help! I have seen a few of these for sale on the Internet and some other websites.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well. Its a shame they don’t have an anime director in charge, because the anime itself is excellent and well done! I really liked this show the first time I watched it but now that I have watched it multiple times I am a fan of it. I would also like to recommend the other two shows by the same name which I have not watched, but I will check those out.|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say that I was shocked by the quality. It was not only well written, but they were actually giving a real plot to every episode. If you have been watching this series long enough , you will have seen it many times. The plot is actually well thought out. There were so many mysteries to follow in the series. The action was just as expected . I was not at all happy with the ending of all the episodes I watched.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently knows where the money is and where you will find it. He does his part of the act of being a pimp ,and he plays it well. The action is a little slow, but this is a fun strip game that gets better and better as the comic progresses. The comic is fast paced and always keeps up with the story line. I enjoyed this comic and am sure you will as well. Just to add to the comic, this is a fun game.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared by making you afraid to see the movie for the first time ... well this is the horror movie for everyone with a strong stomach who wants to be terrified and scared in this one movie .. and that 's pretty much everyone ! The film 's really funny and it has the perfect amount of scare and fear in every part of this movie , the story is very well done , it has suspense in it and it has awesome effects ...|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network’s HD network, and it was awesome . I had never seen a Lifetime show before, it was so cool, it was so realistic , but it also had a lot of humor in it , and I did laugh a lot as a kid because of The Morrison Murders . The movie was so well made , it was like a real movie that was made , and it was very well directed , and it was really good .|0

Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from newborn to old folks . We get a chance to see families with kids that have never been outside of TV for a real live experience. We get to see what kind of challenges they have to work with each other in order to succeed . How hard they have to work and how far they are willing to go to make it through . What I Loved : This show was great and I'm really excited about it. I enjoyed seeing this family live their lives .|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect. The first thing I noticed when looking at the album cover is that it's very similar to the original album, only in this album, there are some more photos. From the album cover to the first song, the songs are pretty much exactly the same as the original. The only difference is that this album has less photos. If you listen to the original, the main difference is that the first two songs are very similar.|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for the second year and the meeting is very important. He wants to do it right. Putney Swope is a good board member. It's important to the company that they hire a good man at a good place to be. He does the job. The company is in trouble because Putney Swope does not know the people on the board; that puts them at a huge disadvantage. In the end the board hires Putney Swope. It's a great movie because it has a great message.|0

I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
"I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this one . it begins with this line:

That's the only reason I'm not dead . And that , you will agree , is the point . the film , as with every other of the series , follows a series of events which occur to the protagonist of this one . at the beginning , we are introduced to the character by seeing his name which in this case is not the name of the character , but of the hero ."|0
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as the classic ""It was a bear's birthday party"" and ""You got a bad attitude."" The cast is still young and cute, so they're having a blast together. I love this book, I really really do and I love how the characters are so likable and I am so glad to finally get another book.

I've had this book on my TBR for quite some time now, but I finally decided to go ahead and get it today."|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster ride with a lot of suspense and a great soundtrack . I 've had the privilege of seeing this film at least six times. It never gets old . I recommend this movie highly to every lover of suspense . This movie is a must see . . . It 's not only an emotional roller coaster ride that never loses it's edge , it 's a great suspense thriller . An interesting story and a great story that you should see with your own eyes.|0
