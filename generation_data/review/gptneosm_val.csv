I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait a few more years before I can start to see what is out there and what it is truly like to be a cable-devil. Now I have a few friends who will probably end up having to pay extra for it, I think. So if we can find a better solution, that is very, very promising. But if we don’t find any, we are going to make some changes to our internet.|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but this is the first I've seen of it. I have been playing games since I was 12 but I haven't played a movie since I was 14. I've never played a movie since I was 19, but it's definitely a movie and a couple of times. My wife and I have always been obsessed with movies and movies. We were both avid screenwriters when it came to creating movies, so it's kind of hard to put one in our hands as a kid.|0
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in the city. On one page was a photograph, and the next the name “NYE,” a reference to The New York Public Library and New York State Penitentiary. Also there were letters of the address. One letter was printed on a brown paper paper. One day on my way in I stopped to sit in the park. I sat down and watched the birds. I put my head next to the birds, and the bird was sitting on the grass.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and views of the characters in the movie as well as the film's tone. The film's themes can be traced to its original premise of a man on his way to be saved by an enemy in the woods, a young girl and her two older sisters, all of whom go on an outing to find their own way home, as well as a boy and two girls who have just come back from a trip.|0
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The cell ' is what the cell ' is, as the film's opening sequence reveals, 'the cell ' is the cell ', which is the point of the film's title. One of the most surprising aspects of the thriller genre is that they're not based on actual cell bodies. This is a little more than is generally possible in the world of films where you can see what's going on around you. This isn't exactly what the cell ' is in the world of action-adventures.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
"I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled his case, I'd like to think that I can see the light bulb that he is putting in place, he's doing everything right! I'm really curious about why he is doing this case. I'll have to see what it takes for him to make that decision. If you have any questions, please let us know. __________________

I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in this movie . This scene is a scene that occurs on the left side of a street . The street is a place where two men play on the street . It looks like a man is coming in to play a role . I would say that this movie is a bad movie for the scene in which one man plays a part . This scene in which he is standing on the street with the two men playing his part . This is how the movie looks .|0
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the Mexican government, he claims to have committed crimes against the public.The court has been given an interim sentence of death for one week. A lawyer representing Mr Hendricks has appealed against the death sentence, saying that he should be sentenced as an adult. The court has received letters from lawyers for his clients and is waiting to hear if they would take him out of jail.“We are not going to let him go to prison, and he must be punished in his home state for his crimes in Mexico.|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe . We could even say that it is very easy to think about it in terms of how easy it will be to tell people what she is, what they want, what they do, and what they should do with their knowledge. I think if you look at the whole process of telling people something you’d call a lot of things that are easy to see are not necessarily easy to believe, or at least things that have been described in some way.|0

"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own. Let's begin with the first one:

In some recent films I’ve seen and heard, many of the actors have made a big impact on the way that the film has been received and has had such a positive influence on the public at large, in addition to a good many others. Some of that has been done by a few people, but many have also been well-meaning. And a lot has been written and published by some of the actors themselves."|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much. I would never have gotten this shit from him for what it did to me. He did it again with this one. On another thread, I'll say again that I like this game. There are a number of rules that you should be aware of for this website to be able to use. I'll go into detail on how I did that, but it doesn't need to be said. There are a few things I will add to the discussion.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in the late seventies. On the day of the film you can see that the students were at a meeting with their colleagues from the United Kingdom and Poland. Also you will see that the film was screened at the German International Film Festival (DIPF) and the German Film Industry (GIF). So the film was the first film ever made to be broadcast outside of Germany, so I hope to do a lot of more film work during the Erasmus year!|0
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series I can think of would be called The Green Planet or The Planet of the Apes. It is not the best . I can not find out . I know it is hard to read . But, if you read this , you might have it . The best of the Green Planet series , because it is . The Blue Planet is full of surprises ! The only thing I can say is that they have really good story .|0
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, I'm not sure whether it'll appeal to anyone with a bit more money than most of us here - but I don't think we'll ever know why it got banned for that length of time. Anyway, it has a lot to offer. It's a really good movie. There are a couple of reasons: First of all, there's so little to say about it here, especially considering the sheer amount of money on offer.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store, it was very nice , i was really happy that i could find a movie which i am gonna watch . i have watched all of them but i will say that it is not perfect, it is too good and not great for me to like it but if it works for you then you get it , it works for everyone , it works for me too. i have only watched the film , i would like to find a movie that i like that would make my own decision for me .|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie Borman on Facebook as a girl in New York. She had the best nickname in New York City. She was known as a slut. After her parents split their marriage in New York, Rae got her first job in the business. She became a regular prostitute, a prostitute, a sex slave, and a prostitute herself. She had a few girlfriends in high school. She used to go to work in a coffee shop, where she worked as a bartender.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being offered a chance to film an episode. This is the second feature of a new cast that has made it to the final few episodes of the show. In addition to the main actors, there are also several cast members, including the lead actors and main cast members. There are three cast members and one main character. All of the actors and the main cast members are available to audition in a single room and all of the cast is allowed to leave on the day before the filming.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just look at something as well as you see it and read it for the most part, you just can't really see it and understand why it is so great . As for why it is so great , you don't have to wait for the end , you just have got it all to yourself . As long as it's made up by a couple of hundred people . . . I mean , that's what it's going to be all over the place .|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally dismissed a number of events , and now it has taken a fresh turn to show how the characters had to live through. However, there are a few scenes which may have been omitted from the play. For this reason it's possible that we have a lot of work to prepare for , but in this paper we have a look at what happens after . In particular it seems to me that when John Osborne is given the title role, he has the whole of the story in his head.|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity's performance. If that's the case then this film has a good frame of mind. However, if it's not, then what's the point of this film or why is it important for us to make it better? Why is it so important? Does it not matter whether it's the actor's acting style or his performance as such, but how can you know what your actor does best?|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways, it is much better than any movie that you might see on film. I have seen it before and it is very funny . The fact that you could actually see it makes me want to cry and I do . It has a great sense of humor . When I was young, I knew that the only way I could keep my faith in a film was to go for a sequel. I never had the same feeling for it because I never really thought about it.|0
"I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9-5 or 10-5 . But this one time, and I was standing on the street in the city I was trying to get out of, I could not move, and I didn't know where I was going, so I ran into him in front of my house, I saw a man and I ran into him and I got out, he ran towards me, he was holding a gun, I started running back towards him, and I thought, ""This man is a monster."|0
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the entire world of movie production as a whole. It's the second movie in a series, and you never know which one you like the most, but that's because it's the one that we all care about. It doesn't have to be the best director we've seen in a movie. And that's the thing I like about all our movies are the way they go out in the world.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It's a great movie for anyone who's in need of an introduction to the movie . And when you're watching it at the end of the day it's not just to watch the movie but to see a really good movie . The movie takes some great liberties with reality . It's also a great movie because it is not only a documentary but a documentary film too . We just want to look at it . And this documentary has got to be as funny as it is.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines both visual and sonic elements. It’s still pretty good but there are some things it doesn’t get as good as it needs to be. This is one of the few of them and I would really appreciate any help you may have given me, or even if you have any suggestions on how to improve the video below. If you need to see the finished product or not see the film, I’d be happy to help you out.|0
"I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks after its release, so it would be fun to see what happens when the release date of the game is closer than usual. If it was the last game that I can say I enjoyed, then I will be doing so. This is probably the best way to get a really good sense of what the game is all about. But I also found this game to be a bit more ""hackable"" than its predecessor, so I thought I would share some of the details."|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The firm was founded in 1984 by Mr. Eure, who had been a security contractor for the British Army and the National Security Agency. He was the father of the author ( Eure ), the founder of Mr. Norton & Associates . Mr. Eure has written over a dozen books and published dozens of books in books, journals, and other publications. He is the author or co-editor of many works and has also authored over 200 books and publications.|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again a teenager, you get the impression that the film is a comedy. But in fact the movie is actually quite funny. If you watch the first episode of The Dark Knight, and then watch the second episode of the same book, and then again, you see that in the final episode. So it's no surprise that when you do this thing, you find yourself in a very funny situation. Or at least it is.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it on your screen for a long time is enough. It makes it easy to enjoy the movie the next time you turn on the TV. In fact there’s a ton of film movies that I could watch that I was not interested in. For example, I could watch a movie on DVD or Blu-ray because there are so many good movies on the market. But I could not find a suitable movie that I really loved.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight and David Nussbaum will also be in production for the film. For more news and updates, click the link in the article. I had this to say before: I'm thrilled with the production on this project. I know that I'm not the only one who had to watch the movie, but I do have a wonderful appreciation of how amazing this film is. That's all I'll say, thank you very much.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too graphic for my liking). Anyway, let’s see what you are looking at. So, if you guys have any time to try your hand at that game, feel free to call me at my email, my phone number and I will contact you. Thanks. My name is Alex. I’ve played some other games before so I’m sure I had a lot of fun, but it wasn’t the end of the world.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite games. The game takes place in the middle of the summer sky, during the Spring and Summer and the end of the Summer. After the Spring , the player can play in all of the game's environments (except the main city). The game plays differently in different cities and environments depending on the player's city. In contrast to the SunShining game, the Sun Shined game only focuses on one city for the player and only plays one city of that character.|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
"I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch it! I just watched it and I was very happy with the way it ended up! About the Film

My name and the films I am most proud of have always been about my career. I grew up surrounded by the beautiful people who make us laugh. I grew up with the love and care for the people who live in a small town. I’ve always been proud to be part of the people who work to make us feel beautiful and that’s just one of my dreams."|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
"For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford has been working on for two decades, and he's still very fond of the concept of directing. So when he told the press that ""We’ll shoot this film as it is"" in 1999, Ford said, ""It's an amazing process. This is one of the best opportunities I'll ever have to make films. I know you guys know that. But I think it's a fantastic way to get ahead in life."""|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with all the action/adventure elements you could expect from it. And that's it for this movie. I was wondering if I should post this review of the movie over on this site for all you interested

Here's some of the other reviews I've received in the past week:

There's not a lot to it. It's just a bit disappointing to me that it's a little bit of a box-office disaster and it's not as entertaining as the title suggests."|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does not exist yet. It is a documentary on the South African experience and on the experiences of people living in the Cape of Good Hope . This documentary is a fascinating read . It tells how we live in an impoverished South African city, and in that world, people living in poverty don't have much of a sense of justice and respect for themselves. This experience was not unique to us. Our experience was shared.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch a live TV show, but that doesn't mean there's not a lot of it. There is more and more footage from this season than you could have ever dreamed possible, and they do a pretty good job of keeping a pretty sharp eye out. And that's why you get so much good slasher goodness, not to mention, with some of your best actors, and all that. So here are just a few of the things you probably should be keeping in your head.|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this :/ ) I'm just glad you love me. :/ Now I'm going to tell you a bit about the story of my childhood . I grew up in the old city and I can remember the first time I visited the old city , it's an old town in the old city , I will tell you the story in just a minute . You will see that I love you a lot :) And now I'm telling you some things about this story .|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . ``

While the book is still in the stages of its release, we are in the process of putting it all together. You may know it's a hardback copy, but for some reasons I have a very good reason to be proud. It's a treasure trove. The book is still in the early stages of its publication. If you find yourself wondering whether this was the book that inspired you to read it, you'll want to check this out first."|0
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. It is a good novel, very well written and enjoyable. I will be very happy to do it again when I return from it . Till then I am going to try and get through it all, but this time I am going to try and do a novel again. If I am not doing something well in my new novel I might just get it through with me again. If not, please do take me there and let me have the book.|0
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the game. The story of the game and how it changed was great. I have already had a lot of feedback on it and will definitely be returning it in a few weeks. I really enjoyed all the characters as the game started. I enjoyed the gameplay and the combat style more. The story was interesting as I enjoyed the level design and the story was enjoyable to play. I will be adding this to my blog once I finish this.|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a man, and many other things , it is easy to find a porno porno that satisfies your taste. But there are some films out there that might not have been in your library. This is because of the fact that many other movies in the past 10 years have done the work for you . It is not enough , you need to have a look-see . If there is no one to watch or you don't like your movie , you are not going to get it .|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and entertaining . If it's not, I can't see any good movie in it . I've done this movie several times in my life, but it's still the best I've seen in my life. As an example of how the movie has changed over time, how many times it has even come back to be a Colombian movie , how many movies are they ever made by Colombian movies . If it's not a movie, it has to be the movie.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
"After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the sequel to North, '' which started out as `` South & North 2''. But I thought `` North & South would be good enough for my interests.``

When I saw the first `` North & South ,,'' I knew it was the one. `` North&Sides'' was coming back, and I felt confident that I could get the series to my heart. But as time passed, I didn't have the confidence to do it, because I could not wait for the sequel to North."|0
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful lighting and a great view. I'm sorry about this. It should not have come up in the first place, I never knew it would be. If you were to see this at any point in the movie, would you say what's in it, and what are the effects? And would you comment on the scene or not? I don't care. I will say the effects were great, because that's a beautiful scene, but it was not as powerful as they should be.|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Raquel's mother, and she was very cute with her hair, and then she shot in front of me. So I can say that it's just gorgeous. It is. There's a picture on the back of this page that shows Raquel Welch. She was a model, but she never was a movie star. And when she was older, she was just as cute as you'd like to think anyone would be.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the spirit of each and every one of the many people who were there during the darkest days of the Christian era, and I also saw this movie for the first time on DVD, as it shows the Christian life in a much more positive light. I also heard some comments about it on the radio, especially those from people who weren’t from the United Kingdom, who had some experience with this movie, who were watching it on television, and those who have seen it on YouTube.|0
"Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ...

By the time you get the movie done , you are probably going to be disappointed. That is to be expected even when you watch the film, you will realize that I am not expecting this movie to be a movie . It was pretty much a big movie , but there is not that much of it. In fact, you will probably not expect something like the one that is on this list , because it was pretty big ."|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
"This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's. In the early 1950's the film began with the setting of the famous ""Black Hills"" scene from ""The Black Hills,"" where the ""fairy"" character ""Fahiana"" was killed by his henchman ""Faulker"" from the ""Hazel Hill"" film. However, after the film was finished, the characters moved on and on. In the early 1980's, the character of the film ""The Black Hills"" was revived, with the new cast returning from the ""Black Hills"" scene."|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a family who live in their home and have been living in a small village for a year in order to have the opportunity to take on a family in the village. This is how it should be portrayed, but I don't think anyone else has the time. I just thought this would be an interesting movie that should be done well. A friend of mine posted on his website that he thought it would be great as well.|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most people are looking to do what I've said before , but I was able to get it and it was working for me . It was also amazing that people were getting used to watching it so much better . So if you're interested in doing something like this - I hope you get some great comments about it . I can give you some info about it too . What you need to do is give some feedback about your movie so that everyone can see what's working with you.|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying these books because I think the only reason I don't like them is not my own opinion . It's a personal opinion. If I bought the first one I would have to think that I'm not right now . I have a long journey ahead . but i'm going to tell you, it is my decision. It's a decision. I do not get what I'm saying, i am not a person who wants to buy something like this, I don't want this.|0
"First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my recent year of reading. I didn't want to write a review, so I took to it and I'm still waiting on the other thing that will give you a better picture of the process. There is no need to waste hours, money, and money on anything you read or watch. I know some of you may be thinking ""why are you watching that? It's so nice to see that"" but if you don't know much, it's worth spending your time with."|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the protagonist of this movie has not just lost her powers , but actually started to fight the demons of her life. He is forced to fight for her freedom and her body , and now he is not only forced to face death , but he will also have to face death at the hands of his demons. Boy Next Door will have to live with this situation for a longer time , and you're gonna have to learn that this movie is real , and this movie will also make it real .|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the best years of his career. He left MGM in the 1960s and spent two years as assistant director. He was also a partner in the studio art department in 1953–53. He did work in a number of art galleries in Los Angeles, California in 1953, 1954, and 1955. In the 1960s he worked as assistant director in the studio in New York and New York. In 1963, he co-founded the studio art department at MGM's Hollywood studios in Hollywood, California.|0
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's a good reminder that you should take that for granted . You 'll feel more at home if you 're not playing UPA. If you're playing it right - you 'll be better off putting UPA on the map in your play. If you play UPA, you're playing UPA. And that's something you could try. It's also something that I don't understand how they do it, because there is no way to understand that.|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone recommend a good movie. I had a little problem when watching a movie but wanted to try it. I think it was a great way to learn about my family and my friends . It was definitely one of the best parts of the movie and also the one in which I can really see how my family works . It’s very entertaining and entertaining . I loved that it gave me a sense of connection to what they are doing . .|0
"-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a good place to start because they both have very interesting characters and stories. * and ''

This week, if you're going to do this, then you're going to need this. I'm really glad that this was actually done. I agree with the first sentence, that it would be easy to add an additional character, but it doesn't work as easily as people think. And yes, this has been added by some people."|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , plus a wonderful cast. The show is very well put together and I can really appreciate this show being such a success! I am looking forward to my next show in the next four years! I hope this is something you are all waiting for! I had to look to see if I could do this show but after watching the first episode of Nurse Betty, I was totally blown away by it. This show has so much of an edge, but I thought the storyline was great.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, he and Young are soon to be arrested for a crime which has caused him serious injuries. Will Peck and Gig Young be in prison together? “It’s a great deal of money and a great job, so I’m really grateful for what I got,” Peck says in the film, which was released last week. “I had a lot of credit, so I’m very grateful.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
"What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule. But if you think a BBC TV show should not be an exception to the rules, then I can think of a good show that is. I have not watched a show that I thought would suit me. In fact, I have not seen them in my life. So if you look at BBC Radio I can see something very different to what I am seeing:

This is, by far, BBC 2's best drama program."|0
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was a time when all the movies on the Internet were just about as funny as they get. But this movie was the last one we saw of it -- just as we are now. It begins in a city where you have to make an emergency phone call every 10 minutes to report an emergency. It goes as fast as you can. In some ways the idea of the movie is very different, but there are still some good things to come from this.|0
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but I really find it to be an enjoyable experience as well. I liked it a lot and enjoy the way you are giving it a try so much that you just can't have it all!! The reason why this movie is being watched so much is because it is a story of a young girl who is looking for love and she has the opportunity to be in love with someone special. This is not a big story , it’s an emotional one .|0
"Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen, although the film is not as good as I had expected. Although it is good enough to stand in my way of explaining my favorite art work in this sense, I have no idea how it all came into being. It doesn't work on any other cinema that doesn't use it as a cinematic element. There are a couple of flaws in my experience:

1. The cinematography is in bad shape."|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1

The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is 16 years old, the oldest daughter, and she’s raised a beautiful boy. It’s an incredible achievement for her, but in addition to her mother’s love, there is the man who holds up the middle of the family, who has been a father-in-law for his entire adult life. The man is very, very strong, strong-willed, and will take care of anything in life, whether it be his kids, his grandchildren, or even the house.|0
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . I know you've heard of French culture. That means you see people from different cultures and you want to watch the movie in your language. And that's a great way to learn French in the French language. If you know the language in English, French can be good for you and French for you. If you know it in French, good for you too. I don't want to take this too much of a political stance against French.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary into the dialogue. “That’s where I think people will have a real, ‘hey, we gotta get to work’ moment in their lives. We’ll go to work, I’m not sure that’s true but I’m a little bit skeptical,” he says, referencing a series of events he witnessed that culminated in his “fantastic victory” as a young high jumper.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts like he has no character to be associated with. Rob is a bad actor, but the character is just as bad as it could be. What the heck are his faults? He has been given too many credit for his portrayal of him in recent times. Well, it's not because he is bad; it's because he is so bad. His faults have been due to the fact that he has no character that he has been associated with.|0

This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I did not have the right place to start. But in the beginning, I did it, and I had the freedom to try and do things I had never dreamed would happen. I was born in the United States , and I lived in the country for a while , but the dream that I had brought to my family was to live and die. I had learned that it is impossible to leave home and never come back.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that you can read it for yourself. But, the movie '' is also simple for you to read for yourself. In the film, if you try and read it, you get the message that there is no real person. If you try to read, it seems that you're reading the person's name. And, if you get the message ""No real person, but a fictional American,'' you get a blank page."|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (he left my parents so young) was to pay me a visit while my mom and sister were staying with the family . They were gone from here until we were 16-17. I can remember hearing my parents crying , I thought I should write this down. So I do. This was my first day away from my family . It was a dream come true that I had not seen them in almost 20 years .|0
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teen boys have been shot dead by the killer . It is an open killing game . It has nothing to do with sex. It is an act that can be performed anywhere, on a regular basis. You will be killed in the game. There are no rules , only the rules and the rules set up. You must do this every time the game comes . You must show your love and keep your eyes on the real thing.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great movie and I have watched many times this film. In the first two minutes, the actress is the first to come out of it. This film has some wonderful moments throughout, but this one does not leave you with so much time to film it. This movie does not have a story that will lead you to believe the story you were told. In this movie, the plot is complicated, the characters have a very different kind of character, but she is there for the good.|0
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and this is NOT THE WAY he is going to work ! The film is written and directed by and will be shown live at least three times, if not more. I doubt they would even care if they were shown in person. But that is just my opinion . . . I have watched more than 5 films so far, and I think I have learned something. In the past, I have only watched about a dozen or so of the film.|0

Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the continuity of his characters' stories. The story thus proceeds with great care, but not without a long struggle to complete the plot. There was a plot, but this plot wasn't finished. For example, in his first attempt to complete the story:

And he wanted to know why, and what it was, that it had been the way of the story for some time, to get it over the edge of the cliff."|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , if they can get that I guess they'd have to wait at least a few more days for the film but it's the first time I've seen them, but I guess that would just take time. I guess we'd get tickets for the first film and then we would get tickets for that film but the film is so long and I think the movie would be a disappointment, so it's very hard to watch that film, but the movie would be a good film.|0
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Hunger Games: Mockingjay,'' which he shot at the end. In the scene that follows, there's no doubt about how good the cinematography was, even if it was a little grainy. There's a scene in the middle of the scene, when Sergio Leone goes to the stage to play a different game, but I don't believe that's actually going to help him in any significant way.|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a bit of style , and it's a big deal in a lot of countries. What is the right time for me to be a professional rocker ? As a rock singer, i think you're just saying that there are some pretty cool things in the world of music you can try and do for yourself and other people's. But that's a tough line. So, what can you think of , and what are the rules you're going to abide by?|0
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the film except in the movie itself. What I wanted to do was create a scene that was to look like this as a movie and then I wanted to edit it as a movie. The way the movie is written, you could edit it as an editable movie that was to look like it was to look like an image . How did I do that . I think it is enough to put together an editable movie so that I can make it into a movie .|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
"Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. The movie is basically set in a world where America is nothing but a small town. I really thought this one was more about the fictional characters than anything else. A:

The film starts by talking about the day after the Battle of Gettysburg in World War I. In case you are unfamiliar with the movie and its title, ""World War I"", it tells the story of a former British merchant from the second century BC."|0
"I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I believe you are very wrong in believing this, as you have to know where it is and when to use it, so you can not make a fool out of yourself. It was never my idea at all. Quote

"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic performance that will keep you going for years! I had to go for it. I got to see the new show and did the first part of the movie and the other part! I was in my bed when I saw this video, and my friends were standing there smiling, watching the new show and talking to my friends! I couldn't believe I got it, the movie was so good! It was a wonderful performance.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White . But he knows a lot better. He was very good in the last movie , but he wasn’t in this movie . . . . . He made a big deal with this film . . . I’m going to start by asking you two questions, why he never got into a relationship . . . and why it was so important that he didn’t get into one again. What did he think happened? . . .|0
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the 1970s and ’70s. The film was shot over many years, beginning in 1973 at a time when much of the visual culture around Europe had been taken down. The movie was also made by a director called Erich Fromm, who took the role in the first film and co-produced and edited the original film. For the next decade, the filmmakers went on to star in the second film. In 1977 the first feature-length film of the film’s story was shot.|0
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in the past, and the story of America. In the end there are many similarities, but I would just say that it also is a unique experience, and it shows what is happening to the United States today. I think I have already made the point that Americans have always been different from what is happening to the world. In some ways that makes it interesting, and it also shows that people can see the world from their own perspective.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it will come before`` the tenth one, `` the Ten Tribes.'' Then there were the five commandments of the Torah and it will come before the fifteenth and after the last and last of them, the Ten Tribes.``

Now the Torah says that in the ten commandments. So it is written that ''it is a covenant made with the Father, with all the angels, with all the prophets, with all the kings, the priests, and the saints who are with them."|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
"Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it ! If you look closely at the video, it is actually very different :P





If you are a fan of the horror films, you have probably heard of a horror movie. That is why I wanted to create a new one and make a new film based on it. Here's the description:



The first thing you will hear is that the first time, the horror film is actually not that scary. But that's not a terrible thing ."|0
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement, which might be named for that. The couple of cowpokes are among the most important cowwears in northern Europe. This is not a new concept, as most of Europe has had no cowwears for quite some time. In Europe, in recent years, the cowwears, like many other people’s, have had to come back to their old way of life. There’s now a good chance that the name “Mormon” doesn’t actually have a cow wreath.|0
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Mike Dinehart ) as part of their mission: to train their followers to ride horses. Their goal is to educate and guide their followers to horses. The goal of these horses, along with their owners, is to ensure that horses do not become infected and that their owners have no need for such training. Travis ( Ben) and Sandy ( Mike) are the only people in the LDS Church that are trained to ride horses.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice story , a pretty good movie. The ending is pretty similar to what you're going for. I like the story more. I think the ending was a little more interesting after the first one. In the ending there was a bad relationship, and I think a lot of people had the same issue with the ending. When the movie was in development, we would have a lot of dialog to it. We could do a story with some good dialog to it.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less surprising when you examine the characters as they are and more interesting when they are real. I have come across the following two examples in an article of mine. This question has been asked by me on at length, but it should not be forgotten. If there are real people in this film (as we know from the books) there are also real people (and in this example it is not too difficult to find real people in the story).|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Generation, a few years back I thought it was the only show of its type. This is a week I am lucky enough to be able to say I have been in it for a month and a half (as far as I am concerned). In the middle of all the hype, this show was on. And now here, I'm here again. This time in America, these two episodes are the only two episodes where I've been in it for at least five months.|0
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time and the most entertaining person were the 2.5 million people who participated in the American Next Top Model. They were most of the people who watched it, I think. In the end they got a lot of attention. However, if I could have watched it again, it would have been a very different experience. I do not remember much about it at all. However, it was a very funny show.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and was pretty surprised with how quickly it got to the end of my life . It took about 10-10 years for it to get to where I was . I still have fond memories of the movie , especially with the music video , but it is still one of my favorite movies of all time . It is very easy to watch it , it is just one of my favorite movies . The music video is amazing .|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But that's not true, and he's just being funny.' And that's true, of course. It's actually been said that ducks are a good sport and are a wonderful way to grow up, but it actually doesn't make sense to say the ducks are for rabbits anyway. In other words, they're not so funny when they're not actually rabbits to begin with. This week, I have just been talking about the future of the English school.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in a few years. This is where the world begins and end-over begins. It would be hard to find the story of a man who has lost a little of his control of the airport. It would be hard to find the story of a pilot who had a life change that he couldn’t control. It would be hard to find the story of an airport that had been built over a century and has had an airport since the early 19th Century.|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's (in fact, for a year or so I actually thought that it was OK). This film was my first project and I really liked it. I think it's a good movie to look back on the time I've worked with people who work with this film. While I've known this film for a while, I never realized how much the film actually took me. That was the difference between it and the other movies of the same name.|0
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time, our heros get married with a kiss and are invited to be his bride . And when they do it is time for her to find her sweetest lover. Who knows . . . ? As if that's the best part of a movie. First off . . . she's not that bad . . . she's beautiful . . . but if it were that easy . . . I'll bet I'd never love her . . .|0
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast , and many stars in the credits have already made a movie , and I really enjoyed the movie . Thanks for taking the time to read this review in the comments . First, I have to say I think it is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire career. It was such an emotional movie that I can only say I have a hard time with the characters and the atmosphere of the movie.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd think was the original video, or at least not that I can remember. There were some people who said that the original image was the original video and I could not recall where, but I had heard of some of the others. But I think you may remember the video was taken in the mid to late 1980s with a couple of people taking a couple of minutes to watch the video, but I doubt if I can remember who, if anyone did.|0
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses the movie becomes more and more complex and the dialogue becomes more complex. The plot changes when Spanky, his father, gets into trouble and the movie is about spanky, but there are other things in the plot to make it a more complicated story. The next movie is the most difficult, but the plot changes a bit for the most part between the two films, but the story takes some time to develop and the plot is more or less the same as the previous movies.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds in the audience to new ideas that they had been looking for for some time before it was a sitcom. I think the program was very positive because I was given the chance to hear a great story that was not just a sitcom but also a very funny and funny thing. The main theme of the show was very funny, with a lot of laughs, so I had a good laugh. You are a new kid on your kid’s block!|0
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have not seen any of it, and this one is still in my closet. We were in a car accident when the driver pulled over. The front end of the vehicle wasn’t turned over, but in my head it was. The driver took his seatbelt and handed the front passenger- seat to me. It was so beautiful! It was like walking in a fairyland. The window in the passenger- seat wasn’t even closed; the seat itself was still open, but it was.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art of War stories. In addition to its use in the media and culture of this world, the Tempest is the subject of a large number of books of its own. One book that is a favorite with children and their parents is ‘The Tempest: The Art of War’, which was published by Tauris Books in 2001. The Tempest: The Art of War is also one of the many books of its own which is available on Amazon, Amazon.ca and Kindle.|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
"Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name ""Maine"" and the names ""Newport"" , ""Boston"" , ""Boston Harbor"" , etc. I have also seen a video with an old photo of a house and a house with the word ""maine"" added to it. The house in question was on the north side of town. It is not the original house, and the original property was built in 1846. The original is now demolished."|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
"Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . But I just couldn't find a film that would stand up to such a long time. Tuesday, June 18, 2014

I've seen a lot of movies this week but I haven't got the feeling that I would've done a better job if the movie had gone on to its next release. There was one particular movie of the week where I felt the movie would be better but I still feel like that's the right time to check in with the producers."|0
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 minutes and 15 seconds to make sense of the whole story. I think he has a really nice body . Just the fact I'm not a part of this movie means I'd never had to sit around in this movie for a long time ... I don't have one, and I can't really find a source. I'm not even sure I have an image, because I have no idea what it looks like.|0
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of filmmaking with an unprecedented ambition. While his work in the 1990s is one of the few films to reach the top-tier of the list , Herzog is no stranger to making movies at this early stage in his career. Not only was Herzog inspired by the work of Alfred Hitchcock , he had the first taste of a film directed entirely by an artist. When the film came out, Herzog had his first look at the world of German cinema.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come back every time . I think I really enjoyed it, but it makes you look at me like I am a kid again . I have watched it again and again. Maybe it’s because I’ve watched it with other kids, but it’s a really nice film, and I don't think I’ve seen it many times. The main point of the film is that you can feel everything in this movie, and not just the main thing.|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . When I look at the music it reminds me of old songs from the days when I was a child playing piano on the piano (as if we weren’t there to play on our own but to listen to our neighbors and friends play on their piano). The piano is a piano and it is part of the home. But it is not a part of me. There is no piano at home.|0
"This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen's memory are not only aware of what was at stake here and of why they were brought in for the project but have also begun to feel a sense of belonging to Karen. Here are a few of our favorite pictures from our interviews with Karen. These are some of the highlights of our trips and interviews with each of the film’s filmmakers. They include:

1. What did you come up with? That was the first question that came up."|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
"I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 16, 2012

Here is one of my favorite trailers of 2012, I would say. I have seen more trailers of the same amount of time, so I’m going to skip any of the other trailers for now. Let’s dive into some of those trailers here:

As I said before, I did not take the chance to test the camera. I do not need a full set of 3D glasses, I just need a good enough setup in order to get this camera."|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1

"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the adventurous, as it is very close to the work and is so good to the young & the adventurous. It was a fun and entertaining journey through the different cultures in the region. I highly recommend it. About

Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes me is 'I'm a bit drunk, but I get out of it and I go to the mall and buy myself a Coke, I go to the gym and when I'm done, I can't really say anything because I don't know why. And I do get stuck in traffic now and there's nobody around to do anything. I go somewhere else where they don't know me and that's about it . I'm sorry to hear of that .|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I think I’m a nice guy. I’m not saying I’m in love or that I’m not, but it has been my experience of the first few episodes, and there are definitely moments where it’s difficult to see myself doing it as a woman. So, to help me understand where this might come in this story, I’d first go into the backstory of the cast of characters for the story.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season is up , this is a good time for me to take a picture .. This season is great .. and i know that in the past seasons the show had a lot of people looking at it , i thought this was going to be good .. but this time there is a lot of new people on the show who have seen it and so on.. and this season shows that the team has taken the time to take the show on .. and so what does this series look like ..|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a handkerchief"". At least that's how it works in practice - if you do anything with the poster's name, the poster will remember it. I have seen a poster for every nurse that I have asked about this, and that's the most common reason I'd ever come to that conclusion. I've even seen it for the past year, when I went to a nurse clinic, and had to give up all my clothes to get it back."|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old and teenage police officer to escape to his own safe house. There is a gang of two-metre police officers, in a white uniform, who manage to infiltrate the apartment complex. There is a couple of teenage thugs with guns as well, and a couple of young adult cops, and the only way to avoid a shootout is to run down the police cars and fire the bullets into the building. The police officers are called up as soon as they emerge.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats not all of it , i have to say that I love it and am glad that so many people love this film . Thanks so much. I am not too sure about what to say here, I am not much of a comic book artist and have never been a real artist and I just don't like to get involved. I would love to do so but the fact I do not have a license to make films is not an argument for it.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who wants to be a professional magician for a while. He also loves cats. He has two cat friends in his care, who are both good with cats. He will let his friends know about the movie when he comes home after work. His friends will also get to see the movie when he finishes his school day. If he decides not to go on a trip in the future, they can take him to his favorite town. It will probably be an amazing experience .|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
"Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies ever made. In addition to his role in the production of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Fantastic!"" (1946), Dr. A. R. Atherton is responsible for bringing Dr. Holmes back to life after being poisoned by the legendary ""Sherlock Holmes"" (1903-1941). Holmes (1921-1923), a professor of psychology and philosophy, has returned to the University of California, Los Angeles after more than a decade at the helm."|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have ever seen, and it was just so brilliant, so true, so funny and so interesting. It was one of the most beautiful and original episodes I have ever seen in a programming studio, and I was very impressed by its quality, even though you could not make it work. When I saw it in its first weeks, my heart broke. I knew that this was what I wanted to be.|0
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how our Colombia can be divided into small towns and large urban areas, as Colombia's economy and people are growing and growing again , and we want to see exactly how Colombia's economic growth will develop. I'm trying to help you understand what Colombia is in terms of economic development, and what is happening in that country, and to understand what Colombian people are thinking, how they are thinking of themselves and of other people in Colombia.|0
"In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders why the author is so obsessed... If you're not familiar with any of the scripts, the first thing I wanted to tell you is a little background:

'''Black Snake Moan.'' This script is an adaptation of the scripts for a classic film by the same name which was shot in Australia and filmed in France in 1971. There's a couple of examples below, and I've included the other scripts, but not the one I'll be showing."|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who is a former prostitute. In the show, the girl has become the main protagonist of an erotic series. The characters in Stripperella '' are all girls, and have a very sexual attitude. They are portrayed in the first-person story mode for a variety of reasons such as the way they act. In the fourth episode of the show, ''Stripe,'' Erotica'' is a regular character. Stripperella'' is a young girl living alone with her best friend, Erotica.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across a book about how to prepare food for school. I don't even know where it is! But, I'll tell you when I first looked it up. Now that I think of it, a couple years ago I bought some books with my first cookbook and it was pretty good but I needed more to make it. This is just the first of them, if you ever read a book on food it could get a bit tedious, so now I decided to try it on.|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about it then, but I remember it so well and I love it now. I have always liked the sound of the films and the cinematography, but it is so much more than that. I have learned so much and have made a lot of great movies in the past couple of decades. I saw The Big Bang Theory at the time. I have a few different movies now, but there are a lot of them.|0
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and tell them you're looking at a good movie and if they buy it they get the money back. Don't worry. The only way you will get away with them is if you bought the movie. When did I ever actually get any money back from this movie? I don't think there are any. In fact, the movie was sold for the most money back. I've never been able to watch this film and I never saw it before.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Rabbit ( 1953 ) were released simultaneously as an E.T. album. The CD-ROM ( the CD-ROM - ) was released as a pre-order edition in March 1953 as well as being included in the second CD-ROM ( the CD-ROM ) in June 1953. The vinyl version was issued as an E.T. box set in December 1953 and was re-released in November 1954 with an extra boxed box set ( as the box set the CD-ROM ) in December 1959 as a pre-order DVD-ROM in January 1960.|0
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , he is the very first comic character of his generation . Heiffernan does a really nice job , but he’s also the only character on the cast who could do a really great job. It’s really funny and really entertaining . I can only say if Kevin James is the comic genius that is Kevin James , it’s kind of ironic because the first comic he wrote was he was the first comic characters to appear on screen .|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even remotely true. When my parents watched it, it was so beautiful, it made me sad. But when I watch it again I absolutely LOVE it. And even if it is not as a child or as an adult, I truly love it. That’s so true. I’m so glad that my kids are so much happier than they have ever been and I’m absolutely heartened that they are happy. Wow! How beautiful it is.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of lowlifes with the mundane life in the country. For the author, these stories are all about high life in Australia. For the viewer, they have a lot to do and there will probably be lots of good stuff about the stories, and the audience will probably enjoy seeing the stories. For those who enjoy the stories in Australia, don’t be surprised to read that Australian writers and filmmakers have developed a love of these stories.|0
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks-like movies. If I were to go back in time, I'll have to ask a lot of folks to come up with what's called the ``Barthelmess Original.'' Here's where I'm starting with a bit of background on the original. The film was a huge hit on the U.S. release, with the release being the second time, the last time, of the original. But it's not just the original that you're looking for...|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to spend $20-$30 a week on these `` blockbuster 's. I think he could have spent $5-7, or $20-30, or even $4-5. It's not too big for him, as we're not in the business of making big blockbuster movies but the most important thing for him is to see the movie on television. So I think he made a big blockbuster. I'm going to make a bigger blockbuster than it was.|0
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since I first saw the show. It's one of those sci-fi and horror shows where there's a lot of action and the action is never as good as it could have been! I'm hoping to see some horror movies soon, and I'll post my review when I go! This was the first time I heard that it's coming out and I was hoping to go to one of the shows this year in order to have a good time.|0

It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either that or I've actually been reading it for the last month or two anyway. And that's the reason why I want to read all the reviews about this film. I know that I don't necessarily read all reviews, because I 'm a huge fan of some of the genre. And I'm very disappointed in all of it. I know I just can't buy this film, and I know I 've been reading this book.|0
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . These movies are so hard to watch, as you have to live up to the expectations of those of us who can never understand. The films are so popular, it's hard not to love the movie you are watching. It can be difficult not to love the movie when you have to watch it so often. So many of you want to read the reviews of these movies, so you get all the pleasure. But most of you can't see what the movie is telling you.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South America. You can do both, with a great selection of movies, but if you have the time to spend in a private room, why not grab one of these two videos and enjoy a different one? I have one DVD of Red Dust and another of South Americans, and they will probably be the same ones, but they aren’t. You can also grab a DVD of both and enjoy them. This will give you the time to read and write about them.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the UK. It's a love story and it's not a comedy but the story is about the two men who had a relationship in the first season of the show, both men in love with each other. I didn't watch the first season. I don't remember if I did. I did go to the TV set to do it. There are some spoilers for the other seasons but it was great to have an audience to watch.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and I am in this country with my own family, my own family has been in my country for some time now. My grandmother was a teacher, my mother was a college student, and my uncle is a business person in the country, he is always one of the most famous of our girls, and I am working hard for my family, I hope this is the best way to make you feel free.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I've had some fun with this game over the years so far, but I think the main challenge is the fact that I do not know how to play, and that I don't know how to use the controls to manipulate them. A:

It's actually pretty easy. Firstly, you play as the player, so the player has no control over the choices you place on him or her, and no need to worry about it when playing with your team."|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of season 10, which we have seen so far in episode 3 and 4 ) I will include spoilers in the episode itself. You might know a little about this episode as well as we did some of the spoilers here:

One of the interesting things about these seasons is that the writers have a very strong belief in this episode. You may have already seen in previous seasons of the show where the writers were just saying ""let’s wait and see""."|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read about this company are not that positive. I'm not saying I don't believe they're good or bad, but I do believe they're a big deal . . . if you're reading this book you might have a hard time finding those reviews in the comments section of the review, which you won't. There is one review I received this week of my review of the book. That review was called Donnie Darko .|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
"The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three of the main antagonists and are now in the dark for years. The first scene, directed by David Gilmour, is as follows:

""What's the use of having two men on a field and having one man take a man's body off?"" ""The first man to have a body taken off his head. The second guy was a hoodlum, and we don't have two men. I think I have the wrong man on this one."|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Boop and her husband had been in town at the time as a friend . They were both working hard in the car, and so had their baby. The baby was getting older and more confident than the old man . So they moved the baby in and took the baby away to get some water for her, so she would not be able to sleep , but they would also get her home . When it was time to get home, they drove around the city for a few hours .|0
"This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Lee , and Lee Lee are all the same person who are always ready to listen to the songs, they have been working together for years to make this great concert so great. The great songs were released by Lee's band before it started. The songs are as follows :

I'm excited to see the band go from there . The band was working on their own project. They also played some of the songs that we were going to use ."|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award banquet , so to get an idea about why it has become a topic of debate , I thought it was worth exploring . But after reading all the arguments, the debate is still interesting and has a lot of merits. I also think it's a bit strange to see it when the topic is being debated at a public event . So I think the most important argument has to do with who voted for it. If you can't agree on a policy then you are probably against a policy.|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure whether or not they should move forward with him. They have all the tools available, but no weapon at the time and no weapons at the moment. Bugs, he knows that it is just a matter of time before he needs to move. He can move faster and faster. If the player has to move, it will come sooner than they think. That being said, they know better than most, that they should move before they do it.|0
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a bit cheesy, but we really do love this movie . We are in love , and we just wish it had a more adult-oriented movie , but no, it 's just what we have to do . I would have to give up on this movie . This movie has no adult elements , so I will just give it a go . . . The movie 's a great movie . This movie has no adult element .|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. If I had seen a movie before I would never have believed it, but after seeing it I realized that it wasn't for me. So, I've had my share of movie watching. It was on Netflix for about 5 hours before I had finished it. The reason for the movie being here is to show that life can change so fast. When you see an adult movie, that's when you start to see that you can change it.|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her baby. This is a great comedy, not to mention funny. It’s funny in a way it was never really thought about. But there’s plenty more. I’m glad it was that way. The show was about her and her baby. Not the baby, of course, and the baby was just a little boy. But it had some good humor, and the little boy did have enough to give it the respect that it deserves.|0
"I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this movie that makes me like them. If you've never heard of this film ... then you're probably familiar ... but you've probably never been told of them ... so ... The film was not written by anyone except for James Cameron, so I'm pretty familiar with it :P

It's said that Mr. Spielberg has never seen anything like this film ... in fact he did not even come to the end of the book, because he saw it at the very least."|0
"`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone was shouting 'Hmmm'

You might have to watch it, I'll look it up later on. But it's still a great piece, and I'll just give you a few minutes for your review, so you can watch it all in the same shot. Good luck, guys. You've got to learn this one before we ever get out of the box. 1. 1- It is amazing how much has changed after this. 2."|0
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch as a masterpiece, but I will say that, I have always felt this was a bit odd in its presentation, but if you don't read the book well you're going to think that it's a masterpiece, because you won't get to see it as well as you would've expected. So if it was a superb film that was set in a period in human history and had something to show in it that I'd been a bit surprised by.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the better comedies . It is about a king of a city and has a lot of people fighting against him in the battle , they are fighting for the crown , they want the crown , but there is no king . I have not found a good one , but if you know any , I think it may be that . If so , it will be great . Well I would have to do my part .|0
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and others, it was really fun getting to know both the actors who have worked on their movies over the last few years and who are playing roles they are not known for and playing roles they believe they will never play again. As it turned out, Scarlett had a role that made her feel like someone had gotten away with something that she could never do with a lot of money and had to put up with, not to mention a lot of wear and tear.|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you are interested in any other movies that were released this year, you can see the original release here. I am sorry but they do not follow this format, I found this one very interesting and you can see it here. The second movie is called 'Bravo 3' and it is so good it will be used as the first movie in this series. The movie is released on Friday, May 30, 2016, at 10 AM.|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy. I had it in a bottle with chocolate and sugar, it was the only movie I would buy for $10. The other movie I bought was a movie that I bought at a movie shop . The movie is the only one I want to buy. I also had a few other movies at my house, the one I sold was a movie that sold at the movie store . I made the movie at the movie shop .|0
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous men, such as the likes of Mark Millar and Martin Scorsese, which was the most popular part of his career? Why was that? As far as I know the best part of that part was that the whole part of the lead robots were taken away, and some of their parts were returned, as well as the part of the robots which the lead robots could use to perform certain tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, cooking and the like.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets look different to some of the other sets. But that’s just for kicks. The main reason for the high quality is to help us understand what went on, what made it perfect and what we need to learn in order to properly create the next Fox Cinemascope. We will also be looking at more of the different sets we will be creating. The rest of this entry is a compilation of the rest of the Cinemascope productions and a preview of those that Fox produced before this week.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this film at a film festival last year which was great. I was in New York and saw a lot of it in the movie theater but I was impressed with how it captured the love story. I really hope it will become the go-to documentary for parents of kids. I love that the movie is a real one. I have to give it a lot of credit but I thought I would have to put it off for a minute.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , seem to be no problem at all. . But, it’s only a few days before the third chapter in The Good and The Bad of Christianity begins, so if you are reading, it will be time to give it a good go. And the first chapter, as much as you may wish for, should be complete. In other words, if you are a Christian reader, you know that there is plenty to be read about Christ and His crucifixion, and the resurrection.|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now. You can see the video, the interview and the trailer here. In my opinion, Perry and Croft have been great sitcoms since the day they were created. They're the best writers, producers, and writers in the field of comedy since they are the best actors in our society today. However, I'm not going to go into details about them, as I've said before, as I have no interest in them.|0
"I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has ever seen, but you can find some great reviews from critics in this issue. So, what do you think? 1. What is Midnight Cowboy? Why do you ask? The opening sequence is titled ‘Where’s The Sun?’

This movie is called Midnight Cowboy and the reason behind it is the story in which a group of young people go to their homes in order to take a chance at some good old times."|0
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This time, you might think it's hard to remember a thing like this ever happened to Australians . . . and maybe it was too late . . . It was too early . . . we didn't have time to see it , so if there were things we didn't do , we had to find out more . . . you might think I was just too scared to do anything , but we had to find out what things were . . .|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a single one of these movies came out today in the 90s . The only thing to keep in mind when I say that is to remember the movie that was filmed in the 80s and that's what it is. The film was never actually filmed in the 90s , and was actually released back in 2000. The only reason that the movie that we are using today would be if this were a movie released today is because it's the film that came out just over a year ago in the 90s.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , i didnt even have a phone) but i would really love a sequel in some form, maybe some more action? I will probably be doing a remake of it and have to wait for the first draft of the movie to be finished and ready for a second look. A couple years back I was reading a new book called The Art of Movie-Making and I was wondering if anyone had ever seen the book.|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing on the Internet just when we got there . I'd been in a hotel room, but not in the same hotel room. The room we were in was different. My brother had the same TV set as mine . He'd just been with us for six months when he was arrested for DUI. I was not in a hotel room in Australia , but in a hotel room on the same property as our brother .|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends (1927), to his final film, ‘The Secret Life of Walter Camp (1931). The first of this trilogy was a short-story adaptation of a letter from Mr LaBute written in 1829 by Walter Camp, which had recently been published in an English language magazine. In his first feature, Camp wrote of his adventures, ‘My life’ (1931) and ‘The secret life of a prisoner in the wilds of the United States of America …’ (1933).|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show so far . i'm really loving it. i love to watch this show ! i hope you all enjoy the show . thank you . It's so great to see you! Love it! Thanks again for the show. I am looking forward to watching more of your episodes! Hope you enjoy the shows as much as i did! Wow! I'm so happy to get back to you. Your review is awesome! I've been loving the show!|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school baseball team in the spring of 2008. But for a guy who plays in a state-of-the-year baseball school, it seems like a real possibility. It’s not entirely surprising, although it may not be easy for him, either. He plays baseball in the high school baseball program in the state of Texas. For years, his coach and teammates say, he has been disappointed in how he is progressing in high school.|0
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the enemy at night, while the General's troops go to the rear of his troops as well. The General does this on two occasions, he will do this on two different occasions, he goes to the rear as well as in his place. On two occasions, General SPANKY is killed or wounded on two occasions, and he is taken into custody by the General's troops, and he has his own prisoner taken to his own country for questioning.|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some of the funniest and most entertaining movies you’ll ever see ! I think most people would have found it hard to understand ! I loved it for sure ! I had nothing to do with it ! It was so cool that I wanted to enjoy it as much as I could ! Thanks for viewing this movie as it was and I wish you had been a part of it as it was just the movie of the year!! Thank you so much for the movie and sharing this story.|0
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the story is more than a few minutes long. The story is also very much about the city. I don't remember what I'm talking about but I know that it has a lot of history, the story is all about it and what people have to say. It was the story of a city and what they were there to do with the city. They wanted to build a giant city like this but it was the city itself and they wanted to find out how it came to be.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the last 20 years. It made me wonder whether they would even make it back. I told my family that I was the only girl watching the movies and I didn't like them. I think I was in love with a couple of girls because they have so much in common. They're so much different in this film so I had to give up on them at first. But then when I saw the trailer I knew I wanted to watch the movie, so I tried to give it a review.|0
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another good comedy. I wanted to read about what they did with it and I also thought it was very funny. And I still think it is, I think it is. You know I was going to get to see how it was going and I thought it was a laugh. I’ll try to read it again, but I’ll try to do it the next time. If you guys want to review me for my review of the show, feel free to send me an email.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale of intrigue and vengeance and romance between two of the biggest names in cinema history: Steve Martin and Richard Attenborough, but Pudovkin is so much more, and Pudovkin is so damn good, I'm going to skip that. Pudovkin is about two men who love each other more than they love anything else in the world, and as we know when you've just spent a month on a soap box in the middle of a big fight, you'll have something more interesting to watch.|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a woman, not a character, but a character. That is what happens when a young girl's parents and the police chase her down the street and she finds herself caught inside a police vehicle, where she cannot be seen. She must be in custody, but her parents insist on the fact that she isn't even alive . Her parents were very angry when Alice and her father arrived at their house, and told Alice to come to a doctor.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music writers who can create the world in which they appear (and their music) is one thing. But there's no way to see them if you want. I remember that I heard the same song a couple years ago, and I was very happy when I saw it, but I couldn't go back because I couldn't stop thinking about the music and the film. Now, at least I can watch them in person, and I can go from being a fan to enjoying them.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , and i think it is the first time for me to have a movie with love. I am in love with my boyfriend, he is in love with his daughter, and i want to get the best part of it ! It is so great, and i hope that by the end it will be a great film! this film is such an amazing movie for me and my girlfriend. it is such a heartwarming experience and i would highly recommend it if you enjoy it.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by his own son. In the last scene of the latest episode of The Simpsons, the two get on a plane together, but don't think they are alone. In a different sense, they are still friends after the murders. It was actually the scene where they are together, though, after the murders. In the last episode of The Simpsons, the two get on a plane together, though, and she tries to convince him to stay in touch.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very long time and it's a hard thing to tell where it goes. The film could have been released with a new title, but it was too short to get a release, and it would have been too hard for most to grasp. It was too hard because the film would have made its way through a few years of production, and it was too hard because the characters were so far removed from the story.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
"I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been working on it as a movie for a while now. I'm afraid that it is not that good at what I'm trying to say. It is a good movie but I think it might be a little overkill in a few years or years. What would you say is the ""good"" one ? How much of a bad movie would you think it would be ? What if I have a slow movie and want to make a sequel with a different set of facts."|0
"i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen the show . its very entertaining ! i can really see the show going to get better . thanks so much for watching! and if you liked the show go to the website and get it as soon as i can :)

Haha! I really enjoyed watching this show so much and I'm glad I found your blog! It's a great show, but I still haven't enjoyed the show for a long time... so I hope you like it!"|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of the current and the pre-1948 world and the early days of entertainment, which we know have not been a part of our culture . It’s important to realize how this has impacted on many other industries in recent decades . We tend to think of films as more of a spectacle than entertainment, though, but it’s very difficult to tell which are more interesting and which are less interesting. This was the case in the movies that were part of cinema in the late 20’s.|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) it's really beautiful. I really appreciate it! I agree that the tunes gold has got to be my favorite of them all. Not to say they're a terrible thing to do but it looks nice for a while. It can be a really fun to play with it, but I really like the ability of playing it with your friends so it's got to be fun. In the end I'll just have to beat it.|0
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband Mr. Moore, a teacher of English and a man with a history degree came out to his son, a girl. ''' This was what happened when Marion Fairlie, who had no idea what he was doing - and had no idea that Mrs. Moore would love him, had left her husband in jail. ''' Her husband had taken her to his home to get out of trouble and they went to bed early, but he never saw her, he thought.|0
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and suspense. I think I have found a few of my favourite films, and I am really enjoying this movie, as it is so very entertaining. The first half of this film was really amazing. I have a few questions I want to know about it and it was really interesting. The only thing I have for you is if I have any good knowledge about these things, I would like to know why they happened.|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children, it was great and I didn't like its direction. I also liked the story and its characters so much it was a tough one to follow. The story was good with a bit of an adult perspective but the characters were bad. I liked that it had some characters who could be interesting but they didn't have good stories. If you like this story and you don't like its direction please share it with your friends, family or other close friends.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
"Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not understand why you can't just go to movies. You can. But when I was trying to buy a book and got it, no one gave me a chance. I don't want to, but it's not going to go to movie. And then after I bought it , someone else said to me ""no one wants it."" I said okay, that is why you should buy it , but I did not understand why you should take it."|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known artist, and I've seen his art a lot of times. It is one of the most important pieces I've seen in years. I like his art, I have seen many many times, but I'm not sure that the artist's style is the same as I've seen in the Egyptian Art.I'm not sure that he is what you'd call an art person; I do not think he is an artist.|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music and gorgeous cinematography. Lest it be said, I am not sure you have a favourite book yet . . . I can't wait . . . No, there is not a book on the list . . . This is such a good novel . . . What I do have to say, is one of my very favourite stories in any novel . . . It is my favourite novel . . . Lest I have to say again . . .|0

"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures are very bad ! We must have the movie ! We must not have the footage ! Let's have an exclusive documentary ! It is really hard for me to write about these documentaries. But when you watch the movies you feel like watching something. For me the best is when I'm sitting on the sofa in my office and watching these documentaries. And then it happens. For me it's very hard to write about these documentaries because there are so many pictures and documentaries about these things.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I had not planned for that time period. I'm glad to see Meredith there, and I can tell you she loves being with us. You'll never know what her feelings will be. I can't help but think that, if Meredith loves her little sister, and you love her dearly, you would not want to give in to that feeling that Meredith feels right away, and she won't want to see that.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more than the show , so I hope it can give you some ideas to watch. It's a pretty awesome show . I really like it too , but not so much that I couldn't make it to the theater because I love what you did with it and I don't like how you were reacting . I hope you liked it . Let's get into it and have fun . We have a lot to look forward to watching .|0
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women. That's one reason she's such an amazing female. She's the single biggest star she's made, and the second-biggest actress in Hollywood, with more than a 50-percent mark, in the industry. But it wasn't until the year 2000, when she moved to Hollywood from the Bronx, when she was in the top 10, that her popularity started to show itself. As a result, more than 100 percent of the female stars in the film business were women.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing well, but it also shows that they have a bad history. For example, if they were to make fun of the Democratic Party in Georgia, the party should have the same party structure as the GOP. But that's not what the people of South Park want. The people have to change the party, and the party shouldn't get out of the way of their own party. They have to learn to change the party.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool action sequences but then the film got really cheesy and it made her cry . This time it's not just a movie but a film too. And this time, it's not just a film because it got cheesy but also a little bit too cheesy . It looks so pretty that it's the movie you can see in your brain and you don't know what to expect or even care to look like . So, it has to be a movie at least.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex and I think that a lot of this film was filmed at a private residence for the elderly and not many people have seen the film there is no place to go there to view the film , there is very little of a film that you can take on your own but you should have a guide in this film. I would love to do the same thing in the Philippines and I am very glad to be able to do so.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Funeral, Because If You Care For Yourself, You Get A Funeral. And That's What They're Saying''. They're saying I have done n't for a week. So why? Because it's for a purpose, to make you feel better about your family. They want me to look at a funeral, I don't really want me to look at a hospital. I do want a funeral.|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the day before the event, a group of me and my husband (and I, too , for that matter ) went outside to get food from a restaurant. But I couldn’t afford to go out and get anything from a restaurant. There was no other way to get something. Well, that was the thing I was wondering what would be the difference between eating a delicious meal at the restaurant and a fancy pizza at the supermarket?|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
"does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have it on here and I'm looking to download for this project. Anyone have experience with this video or any kind of video editing? Thanks in advance...

Hello all! I am new to video editing and I've made some videos to help you in this video. There are a lot of tutorials on youtube that you may need and I wanted to share one with you. Please read on! I will give you some of my tutorials to do. Thanks a lot!"|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we watched it every chance we got . we loved this movie . I never had a problem understanding what movies you watched. I had a hard time finding a movie that made me laugh as much as my kids did. They were all great in the movies. I was not a fan of movies like this but it was one of my personal favorites. I watched it as a kid and I loved it. I'm not saying I'm not the best but my children loved this movie better.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is felt more strongly than any film that has ever existed in Australian cinema. It is also the only film that has not been banned by the Australian Federal Court, nor the first-ever film-related ban issued by the Australian government in this country. It also stands out as the only film that has actually received an Academy Award or Gold Medal but is being made and distributed in Australia, so that it will not be the only film about that topic.|0
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
"I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 on that list. But I was hoping it would go up a few points and make me a couple of points more,  

It will probably give me more than the 6th, but there are a couple of ways 
It might give you a little bit more, to offset the 5. It will probably give you the 12th. Here is all the details that I have so far...  
1. The plot of the movie (I'm using the movie) is fairly basic."|0
"One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but in my opinion it's the most interesting . But that's still a long way to go to get it right . There were other westerns in history but they weren't as interesting as most of them were ;)

That's why I'm going to do the most important westerns ;-) I'll be adding the new ones to my collection that I'm sure will be my favorite new Western ever . That is a lot of time to learn all you need to learn ."|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as well . We all know the Civil War was played by Robert E. Lee , but it was also the first Civil War movie. It was not only a really good movie but also a fun movie that we enjoyed. There were so many good movies that we could not even watch it. We were always in a rush to make it next year so we did not really have the time to read the book.|0
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later happened to be the first part of the game, and it's not so bad. We'll see how that goes on for another day. This was a great idea! I was thinking I'd find the game interesting, a lot of it fun, but unfortunately I got lost. I think the first part of the game, the first half, was good, it made me wonder what it would be like to get up and start running.|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost Stars » ) did it. You could say the man has a deep personality, a strong sense of style, a sense of humor. He's a funny man but is also a funny person. You could also say that he has a love for comedy and a fondness for making things funnier for people he knows. This may be an apt description, as the guy knows comedy all too well, but he also loves to make jokes.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in filmmaking ) i had an interest in the art form. ( i'm not saying it's perfect or not , I'm just trying my best to be as intelligent as possible in my way of studying for a film ) and it made me think about the things that I have spent the previous 4 years of my life learning to study and I wanted to spend my life thinking about it. The thing was that I wanted to become a film scholar .|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be a show to me. And then you feel like a TV show, or something. And when you do it and you do that, or you do it like a sitcom, and you don’t like the show, you don’t really like the character, and your own personality, or the character. Because you don’t know when it’s coming, but you know what is in it. So I’m thinking of the sitcoms.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
"Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy. Well, it turns out it's actually not. When the film's makers announced at a press event last year that it would air early next year, they didn't mean to make it that long. Instead, they wanted to put the film in a different format for this year's special. ""There were two things in the movie that surprised me immediately,"" he says. ""A director's vision, and that is what people are after."|0
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances. But, the characters are much more interesting than in most of the previous films. The main character of the first film was Jackie, who was played by Candice. Jackie, like so many fans of the first film, wanted to stay on his own. However, she decided to make another movie, to star Candice, and wanted Candice to be a model. But Candice decided to take the lead role of Jackie as he and her partner, and the role of Jackie’s partner was chosen.|0
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, it can work , with some of the better techniques (see [3.1.3] ). And, more often than not, it can be used in a quite specific way . In this way, it should be noted that in most situations it should be avoided. In such instances the victim should be asked to leave the room or to go out into the street to get a drink or make some phone call.|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are trying to gather together. ""You're the leader,"" a voice says. ""You are the man who is supposed to tell us how to get into our towns."" The Mormon leaders look around and see several people. ""How's the group going? Are you getting a grip on your own?"" The Mormon leaders smile. ""Not so good."" ""Good enough,"" another says, smiling at them."|0
"I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld’s The Great Gatsby. In this interview, we discuss what the episode means to us and why we’re doing this kind of show. And I also want to talk a lot about the other episodes. Episode 1: Season 5

It’s the season 5 premiere that we’ll be discussing right now. As I mentioned earlier, there are some episodes where they’re in the show’s running order and are not even there yet."|0
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
"The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her mouth and chin. But in the end, she didn't think he'd hit her enough to get her out of there. She didn't think he'd come right back. ""Well, come on, now,"" he said. ""It's the only way I can get her out."" ""Thanks,"" he said. ""It's been a long time since I've done that. I mean, there's been no one like me to do that."|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1

A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their finest, but there is much to watch out for. It’s the beginning of the decade for many of the best actors, actresses, musicians, actors and many others of course. And it’s been an exciting decade. While there’s no way you can be in such an emotionally charged decade, you can be here for a real treat . You’ll discover the best parts of the 50-year-old era.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV series, which is one I haven't seen on TV yet, which is not one I would actually like. It was a great series, and if I remember correctly , one of my favorite series in the series was this one. The first episode was aired on TV at 8:00 am. During the next hour , I began to get tired . After the first half-hour, I began to get hungry . I decided that I would give it another shot as the first half-hour.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
"Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis, but this one shows how great it was ! I think it will be a good read for those of us who like to read things short and take chances! Tuesday, May 18, 2016

Last year was the year when I went to the library to buy my books! I was not really interested, so I bought a couple books. Now, I have my books again, and have not had to buy them all in the past week."|0
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve McQueen and many more! I have heard this game a couple of times myself. The first time I played it I found I was able to pick up a board and put the skate to work. This game was fun to play, but not a great game as I am going to make it my own this year. When I play this game I get the feeling that it is a game I play on my n64 so I am very excited to try and do it for n64 .|0
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going. We're on schedule. Mel will be with us in the fall. If we don't do anything at all, Mel's on board. Mel is the only person who's going to work with him and his mom. I think we can do it. If she doesn't like us, she's not going to do it. If she likes us, she's going to stay away from us. So that's going to keep going.|0
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
"Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to a movie full of good action sequences . In fact, the whole concept of the movie (the plot, the plot, and what you might call its characters) is very much like its story . If you look hard enough , you’ll see how it plays out . And you will have the same feeling as the movie did . But here is why it is important . Drama

It is a tragedy, a tragedy ."|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai is a sweet little girl who lives with her mother and grandmother, who love to tell her every detail and make her laugh while she sings. This is her first time ever to date Lorelai and was a big hit when it was announced that she had a new boyfriend in October . After the release of her first hit single, ""Lorelai"" was announced back in October , and is one of the most hilarious show of all time."|0
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , but I've had the same experiences). You can find them online or at the Google Book store. Now that I have seen this picture of the guy, I'm now ready to see what I can find out about him. I was wondering, what is your reaction to him? What do you like about him? There is no one like him! I like what he does. It's just one thing that we can learn from, he's such a good kid.|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 1990s when I watched the first series on BBC television. This was my first time in a series and I had to read the first two books in order to enjoy it. I had been watching the show for quite some time now and have enjoyed watching the first four series since that time. It was very entertaining, as always, and I had a lot of fun with it. It was also my first experience on a show and I never thought I could repeat it.|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure. '' Jaded should not be considered as sex thriller because the scenes of sex should not be played in an erotic film format. '' '' Jaded should not be considered as a sex thriller because it is not a film format. I think that you may be confused by a few words that refer to a movie in a movie format, but that's not how they usually talk about movies. They do not discuss sex scenes. I agree with the above statement.|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot and that it's the moon is hot. And I want to understand that. And you know what I don't understand? The movie is telling me they are not talking about the moon, it's telling me they are not telling of that. They are talking about the moon, they are telling of what happens in the earth. That's how you know it's not making any progress. They have a problem with what they're saying.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of, and I don't know the exact location. It doesn't look anything like what I expected. But if you look close enough you can see the logo of the game . The only reason to go here is to watch a live one. The first one I watched is when the game was showing. I played it for two minutes and it was very interesting. But the second was when it started to be shown.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational ) that the movie itself didn 't even include an ending yet. We can't see that yet, but it looks very much like it should have. I can only hope you find this thing, or at least see a trailer for the video and a look/feel of the film. Just look for it. You'll find out if this movie is worth it for its time and effort. If not, don't worry about it.|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , no doubt but they will never see the light of day , as we are supposed to be seeing all their lives for them. This makes us want to take up the battle over women and girls, not for the glory and glory , but because they are in a place of power and wealth and they have a role to play, as well , so that we can take back their rights and enjoy what they did to us in their society.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in the Japanese market, a Japanese company has developed a new technique for making Japanese film, a process that can produce high quality video at low costs! In the course of the video research of the film industry, it has become a very important technology for the industry as it has become a very common tool of the industry in all aspects of the video industry as well as the industry itself. Now, we can take this video and make it in Japan, by using the method in the previous step.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad the film, whether it’s a movie, a movie, or a movie in the first place, I can tell. I’ve been working on the film for nearly ten years now. What is it, exactly? And why would you have so much faith in a film like this, where the director’s voice is all over the place and you’ve seen it before, but the cinematographers know it so well you can see it for yourself?|0
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a few years before the movie is finished . It also lasts some years before it reaches its peak , but it goes on to be a great movie of some kind . A movie in such a film will be considered a success , especially when it happens for the next few years and the last year. However, it is not the only movie that may not have a success. If the success of a movie starts out in a mediocre or even mediocre movie . .|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile personalities and it's great to get into the spirit of the movie . How many of you are saying the film was not a good choice to shoot? I'm sure many people would love to hear about it , but I am not saying this film was bad . If you look hard, I can see it being a good option , but the film is better if you shoot it through the lens . But there are no good movies in cinemas these days .|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I've never said in school ..... It just sounds too weird for the teachers. I feel really uncomfortable about this, particularly if you're a student who doesn't understand what I think you're saying or feel like you have something you've never talked about.. That I don't think any of the teachers know the subject ..... If you've never met the person and they haven't said anything, don't try to ask for help with that..|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything. I've heard 'em before, you know. And when I hear that you're here , I feel as if the world has changed in years, and I can't help but to be more aware of it. It's so funny. ''I'm not so sure it's funny. 'cause it's such a funny, good soap. You know, if you could really be like me , it might be funny too.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's an officer in a private company , who's working on behalf of the Union, on behalf of the Federation .

He's getting an additional $ 10,000 a year for his pay, the Union's saying.|0
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this, so I am going to try to get some answers here to explain why I hate it. As it turns out though, this one is the best I have seen. As far as I know this is the worst I have seen so far. I went through all the reviews from the movie and then watched it as a kid in the summer of 2005, which was also the time of his grandmother being murdered. So now I am almost at the beginning of my search.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , the idea was born , `` and `` the idea was born again. For it is as good a theory that I see as possible for the `` slasher '' genre of films. `` The slasher movies are always about people. They have a lot of things to do, they don't necessarily get a lot of attention and it is as if they were going to be a small town. It is just as if the film was going to a big city and would have a lot of kids.|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a young woman, but of all things mind-blowing, and that it has a story of beauty, grace, wit, grace, grace . . . And it's a true masterpiece , in a nutshell . . . But if you want to see the heart of this masterpiece , you're going to need the help of another. It's a beautiful masterpiece ; it's a masterpiece . . . And it's a masterpiece , and it is. . .|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , it has been more of an after-thought than anything, and I am glad it is going to get out there. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to send an email to the editor with your suggestions in the comment thread. Thanks for the comment, and I too will have a chance to try that! I'm going to show up on Monday and try to figure out how it went before we get in. I'm hoping it will be a few more episodes.|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired about the character, the plot itself is interesting. And the story itself is intriguing, too, because the action (or the villainous behavior) is so intense and compelling. This is what the movie has to offer and it's not really the most exciting story of the last few days, at least in terms of direction, plot or characterization. I think it was good to know that the story was telling, and not the movie.|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows that in the world of the film the people really appreciate a good performance. So I was looking to get some more photos of the group and then I decided that I wanted to take pictures of them and see how their faces turned in the shot. So the shot was shot with great clarity. It was really fun for the film . In my opinion the group of the people in this movie made the most impact on their own life .|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this album is amazing. It was a great record to play, I suppose, and if you have any friends in the world you will get a very good chance. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great record for those who need it. I would not put any more on this album than I would put in a compilation, but I would still recommend it. I can't recommend it a second time or so. This is great!|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time with this film. I loved how he put the film together! We have to admit that this movie was a great experience and I was really enjoying every second. We got to see it again in the very close of the film. I have to add that the soundtrack has been well done and was very pleasing to listen to. It is truly a movie that could easily be viewed in its entirety, and would certainly make a huge difference for someone who wants to see a great movie.|0
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of those books that had some of them in the last few years. It's a book you can't buy on DVD or in Blu-ray. If you do subscribe to any of the books I have mentioned above I would be glad if you would like to get it. If you buy one of these you would be delighted. You can also get the books directly from the store. It's an incredibly easy to get these books.|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  it sounds like it may have been written by the director  you know where they come from  you get lost in the text. There are hints at a mystery in this film  but it is not one of them. This is a long film in which there is very little information, or a lot of exposition, in any of the three films, but in this film it is all a story that will be told in a very short space of time.|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was in the best shape I’ve ever seen in my life. It’s been called “Best Picture Ever” by a lot of people because I thought this was the first time I ever saw something that made a big impression. I don’t even know if I saw anything similar. I know you have noticed how much you can’t wait until it’s available, and I can tell you it was a great release from a great director, and it is one of those movies.|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1

North and South Book I (1854) - Volume 1

North book I'' is an 1841 book written by William Morris in the London and Oxford English styles. It is about the development of English language and literature between 1814 and 1859 and about the emergence of the novel in England. This book was translated from the U.S. (U.K. English) and published in the U.K. by William Morris Publishers (UK)."|0
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for that book . That is all. I have no idea how many of them. The one I was writing is this one . All I can say is, it is so very special . And I don't know anyone who knows someone who wrote it . But if I'm wrong , I know who it was written by , who has written it  , or is it just someone who has written it . But it's so . . . .|0
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. The only way for me to be able to watch this movie so I can enjoy myself is with my phone. When watching movies you can be sure to watch some very funny movies because sometimes you'll want to watch them. I am also not sure I understand how to watch a movie properly when the movie is being watched, but when I do I can. This is a fun movie that is not really meant to be funny.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started from the end of the era, but the film has always been pretty much the same as the original: action sequences take place over the years. In fact, it is the main focus of the slasher films that take place throughout the years, which is why it is so important to know what slashes and slashes are going on. It’s not to say slashes are the same thing as slashes, but it’s easy to see why the slashes are important.|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch but I just really enjoy watching it when it 's at it's max . I've only had this one time but I'm getting used to that . I just want to take a picture and see how it is . If the camera doesn't go in, I think you will like it more than I will . I got one camera this year and it's a really easy to use one that you can use . So this is a little different .|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , or that I have not seen many good films and movies from you. But, that doesn’t make me the kind of guy who does not care about the movies and movies, or the reviews and reviews. I am not saying that I have not seen the movies or the reviews, I am saying that you might enjoy the movies or the reviews. In other words, I have not been happy with what the reviewers are writing, or with what you say.|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what I've been doing here . . . but . . . here is a couple of questions . . . what do you guys believe that it would do to you if Karen Carpenter is found . . . . why not? . . . and if she didn't do anything like that , then . . . would you think that you'd be the only person out there who could understand the implications . . . . the whole thing could be solved in that way .|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); !

We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . . . I was very much on edge at the time but it was actually an amazing experience . . . It was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. The cinematography was brilliant, I've never seen a movie that went so well. It was the most beautiful scene I've ever experienced in any film. I've never had an entire day in my life, so I don't think you can blame it on that. It was amazing.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . . . and that brings us to Pa Kettle! It’s no surprise that Pa Kettle is definitely not for everyone. After all, as he explains in the video above—and I’m sure many others will come along—I have no idea what Pa Kettle is for you. But I’ve known Pa for a long time, so I know he’s a big deal. But Pa is a wonderful guy. And we’re lucky to have Pa on our side.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd think it went wrong because it didn't want to go wrong . I 'd say, when I was working on a picture, I was saying to the film director, “What does it look like if you don't do it? I want to do it . What do you say? What do you mean? I don't work with the film director.”

I think that's true, but it's not the most accurate way to do it."|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's not the kind of movie you 're going to see. There are so many movies out there that you have to watch in order to enjoy it. And that's what happens, when you 'll get to see a movie in a film studio and watch it. So, what I don't understand is what you are saying is wrong. That I'm making the movie I want to see so that I can watch it when I go to it.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am so happy I saw this movie . I have had so much happiness in watching it and I've been waiting for a long time for it . I'm sure you have a lot to say on it . Please read this . Thank you . . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJ8-W3hkD8

Thanks everyone for supporting me with my movie, it is so much fun to watch the films. I hope to have a chance to watch them again soon as I get more movies in my area."|0

"John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry shows. ""We wanted to show them the special picture, which was made after the big show in Delhi last night. It's a special picture but it's not for sale. So we did our first one. The special picture was made by the Indian Army, but we're selling the picture and we are the owner. There are some pictures of the big Indian troops and the Indian Army, we think it's an old picture."|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies made me remember that the movie is called `` The War.'' '''The War'' is probably the favorite of many people, and I've never forgotten the name, ''The Battle.'' It's one of the few films that I can remember which had ever been in print as a story. So I have to go with this movie that comes to the conclusion of the documentary film. It was the third and last film I've worked on in my career.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (who wrote the screenplay for this) as an expert on the subject, and she was able to create some great writing in this series that would really get to the heart. This episode of the series also had a beautiful cast, with an excellent cast of people who had been there a decade or so. I think you will find that this has always been one of my favorites in TV series. I also enjoyed the fact that the show moved on a couple of episodes a year.|0
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
"I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me , but I have to be careful about using it in every way , because it will 've taken me some time off my job and then I just want to know what the hell was going on . !"" ------

I'm going to call it a thing . . . So what the hell do you call art-house?

I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a new movie . I have never been a fan . It's very interesting . This is the second movie I have watched . The first has an amazing cast and a very exciting story. This movie has been in theaters for about five years . This movie makes me feel good about my life . I have also had the pleasure to watch a few more movies that I thought would be interesting . This is a very interesting film and has very few parts .|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface-like characters that don't even have to be made out to be real (even if the film was made for the real-world of people who were not there ). The only drawback with this film is the need to make it look a little different, but that's all it has done. I'm not a big believer of the movie making, so I'm sure it won't be as good as anything that's made for real people who didn't work there.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired) and I did not like the way the story was told . The characters , the plot and plot of the film did not work out to me but it did make me laugh a lot ( I really liked how the film was told as well but that was not necessary , I only saw how it was told). I did have a couple problems with the plot but I am very happy with it and will return to it in the future .|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a link to his book. We also want to remind you of many things that happened to me in a recent time. Please come and visit our website. Last week, I started working for a group that was seeking to make sure the information was accurate so that we could update the information. However, the group was unaware that this information was going to be available for the first time. I believe that the information we gave you was accurate.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in its time span. There are two things I think I can tell about the game's design. First, I love the design, because it's very intuitive. You'll know exactly how the characters interact with the game and how they move when they are on the screen. And I think this will make a great experience for people to play through this game even if you didn't know what to expect.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. The western was first released on television in 1959 and was well known as a great success and one of those TV series where the audience was allowed to see it in person. In 1966, as a part of the 'A Little Night at the Bazaar', the cast was invited to join forces with The New York Times in the cover story of the film. During the first season the cast also performed as a part of the production of The Good Wife (1974).|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching the movie first or be finished first. So, in theory, you could start to watch this film first and then finish watching it. But the problem with the movie is you will have several problems. You may be having a few issues with the movie you are watching. So if you are just starting to watch the movie and you don't have time, you will not finish watching the movie first. But if you finish watching the movie first you will also be able to watch the movie.|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and I have always wanted to see something like it and I was excited because I knew it wasn’t really funny. But I couldn’t make it into a movie because I just couldn’t find it so I had to do something with it instead and it was funny and funny. It was a fun cartoon, it was funny but I also knew it was not funny as well as I thought. I knew it was a cartoon, but I still had to do it.|0
"A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger

And then I realised that one of my earliest memories was one in which I began to remember some of the events. I remember thinking of a film in the early 1960s and then a film in the 1970s. I think I’ve managed to do a decent job of it for a couple of years, and I hope I didn’t cause a scene by accident. But what about the films of the late 70s and early 80s?"|0
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life and fantasy, with a touch of dark humour and comedy. The film, however, is set in New Zealand and there are so many things going on that it needs to be written into the film. In that sense, the film is both an entertaining and entertaining piece of work. It's a little bit of a test to see if the characters can be portrayed in some kind of comic form. But it also means that there are plenty of things in it that could be improved on.|0
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to be the man behind it. I have been fortunate enough to look at this one for me and have found a film that will be my go to film for the next 30 years. This is the kind of film my eyes will take a moment to savor. I can only hope they release a better film when I don't have to watch it all, and if that's all they ever have then I'll have to say they have a good film to do it all.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with an introduction to the ancient Greek myth, and an essential to understanding the story . In fact, you will feel as though you just read them . While I was researching this site, I came across an interesting post from another guy, who had been writing for a while:

“The story that I want to tell to you is a myth. My first wife was married a little more than 5 years ago, and she was just one of those little ones."|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during the first day . But when the week ends I have to go back and see what's new . As I watched I couldn't get the time to look at the episode without a little bit of background to it . The episode has a lot of interesting characters , and I think it makes sense . I'm going to try and keep it updated . As I was watching I noticed that I was seeing a lot of interesting characters from the show.|0
"Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of a cell, such that the internal cell contains only two elements, each having their own width and height; the cell '' is itself composed of only two elements of each length, the cells '' being of a given width, and each length being a unit of the cell. `` In '' the cell '' can be in any shape.

Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
"10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I am very grateful to all the actors and actresses who provided the soundtrack to the film which I have never been in love with . The movie was nominated for the Best New Director category. The film was also made for the Best Sound Mix award. The movie itself was a hit in the theatres of New York and London, with a release in Canada in 2008. Soundtrack 
The film was made up of soundtracks by some of the cast and crew."|0
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
"After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as brave in the face of injustice and cruelty as they are. ""There are many reasons why an American woman should feel better when she is faced with injustice,"" Hayes said of her own experience. ""I had never met a woman in her right mind that was treated unfairly."" Hannah Williams, a mother-of-two from Brooklyn, said that when she spoke to her daughters on Thursday, she didn't think it was a problem for her."|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in ways I never thought possible . It also touched my sense of humor and the fact that I had seen such a show in my childhood and had not even read its source in the last two years . The audience at the event was so huge, I could hardly stop breathing a sigh of content . It made me laugh in the least . I was never able to get past the feeling of sadness when reading or listening to this show, so much so that I knew what it was.|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it. It is an excellent film to watch when watching the other movies from Ebay and I would love to have seen it again. The movie was a lot like the other two movies which I have seen here and there and I am so happy for them. The movie is well worth a watch. In this movie, I would like to take a few minutes to see the movie for yourself and if you do not want to watch a movie in this movie you can check out the EBay page.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea 'for a few days. I know that I've seen it, but I didn't know it all at the time. If I were to write a piece on 'em, we'd all know, but what would you do with an 'em, would you be a doctor, or an 'em, or anything else? That's why you don't have a piece like that. That's how I think it is. That's exactly the point of my writing this piece.|0
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 times before, but I didn't find it that amazing to me . The actors and actresses are all so lovely . It's such a fun film - I could never have imagined how I'd look without them , I couldn't wait to see how they played so well . . . I'm sure it will be on my favorite TV series this year . The only time I can remember it was in '90 when I saw it in theaters for the first time .|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is a great movie . It plays well with the audience and is the best comedy film in history . It is one of our best-known films of all time . It is a good movie if you want to remember it . It is not only one of my favorites of all time but there is also some other films as well . It is well animated with the actors who play very well but it will not work for any other animation. This movie is very funny and directed .|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the 80's and had nothing but trouble . There were movies I liked but I could get away with it . A movie I liked but I was too busy and I got too tired . What I didn't enjoy was movies with sex. Movies I loved but I couldn't get away with it . I was sick of porn movies so I started watching them. I didn't know how much to get rid of them .|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm going out to see what's new and interesting . I have been wanting to get this one a lot and I've been getting a lot done and I'm sure that I'll be getting better and better in the coming years . So I have been looking at a few options . Just to see what I could go for . Let me know and then I hope it 'll be better . Thanks a lot , and I hope everything is working out .|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory , but at least it is funny . If you've never seen this in the movies then I highly recommend you have an in depth review . This is still one of the easiest films I have ever been in . However, you could still do a lot of fun with this . I would highly recommend it to you . This was the film I would watch . This was really fun , I had a lot of great fun with it , and I'm really looking forward for it .|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student union. It was the first thing I heard in class and the second. It is the last time I will see the film in a cinema and I will be reading it. But first, of course , how about that ? One of my first questions was : why did the film stand out as a masterpiece ? The film was written at the moment when we are not much older and this is where I started to get my first idea as an aspiring filmmaker.|0
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply a `` dream of yours. This is a song I want to sing so I can listen to it again to get a better sense of the concert and how much the concert has done since that time. I am currently working on some new music and would appreciate hearing any new ideas on how to get it over and done if I can get it on my own in less than 15 minutes. Thanks for the suggestions! I will be posting more about this concert tomorrow.|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George Romero for a while. In my opinion it was an amazing movie. In the film I was so much more than that because the story and the scenes were so beautiful and it made me so emotional. So I’ve been wanting to learn more about what I watched. It was incredible, I was so happy to find so many beautiful scenes. It’s been a long time but I finally found the source of my passion to watch the film.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy for being a great show. Thanks for the great performance! I'm very excited to work with such a talented cast so far and I will be working with the Williams for a lot more of things. I would like to know more about his role, but that doesn't mean I'll have to spend much more time on the stage or even on the screen than on this show. What is your idea on his work?|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked scenes have a lot to tell upon its debut . It's hard for me to know if I still like the new movie and what it's about because it has to be made for that film to have that great visual experience . I am still a little skeptical . I think I do not like the sound quality . It's just too much to put on the stage . I can't hear the sound in the cast.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little more carefully than usual. If you think that someone might not be interested, do not read the comments, you will miss my point, because I feel that there is more to a good story than meets the eye. You don’t need to write the story, or read it if you want to give it more meaning. So what is the purpose of ‘reading’ the story? Why not simply go and see if you can read it in person.|0
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound impact on me and some of the younger kids in my neighborhood. There are a few scenes where I’m a kid in a theater and I feel so proud to be a part of their lives. It’s a fun film to be in and to watch. There’s also the first of a series about a young girl named Marissa who has just been married to a man who’s been in a relationship with her for a number of years.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make the most of what he was doing, you probably knew this. But you also have a life. You have an idea of what you want or want to accomplish. And when you have a chance to do that, you can’t really take it personally. This is an important point: the idea that if you work hard and work hard enough, that you can come back and do something great, then it’s all your doing.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. I have not been in this movie for so long now, and I was just waiting for it to catch up with me, especially since I was looking for a new title. I honestly am not really a fan of the movies anymore and I am sure I will miss this one. Last night (Wednesday, September 26) it was my favorite of the two last weeks of the year, and I have been very lucky with how little I get in advance.|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great care. I’ve always loved the film. I know that I am very close to my family and friends and I’m so glad I do so. I will be watching this again, if that is the case. I think that this was an incredible movie. It was just what I wanted, but it just came to life. I was very happy that the story and the message that came out were really funny. I will miss watching the movie!|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me not be too clear . When you have a film which can be made out of any other film , it is called a box and is made out of only certain materials . The reason that it is made out of one of these materials when it is not one of these materials is because the films are different . Thus , it may seem that it is the other material that the other material is. This is why it is important to give some examples .|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple more questions. Here are the top four questions from the day, and I'm gonna have a look at what's coming down the road. First up on that is this one. I can't believe there's more questions on the way yet! I'm so sorry, I don't know if there's a way to make it better yet. But, you know I don't think it's a good idea not to answer these questions, as it's so important.|0
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice but I didn't watch it , so I'm not sure if I'm seeing one or not . As I said in my first post, I don't even know the original cast but I do know that they have some great and varied actors to match. I've had to wait for all these movies and have no idea what to expect! Well, in a few days I'll see how the cast has gotten over themselves.|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn good , it looks so good so I know this DVD would have been better . I did research and found out that this was only one of the 3 DVD's that has been posted in the past year . I checked them out and they look good . I don't think they have been around for long . I am sure there are people out there who will be looking at this DVD . I know this is not the best DVD for me but I found this DVD very useful .|0
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! ! ! ! i have the most incredible pictures of them and this has been my go to film to see them ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! ! The only problem i have is the movie doesn't fit very well as i understand it when you try to watch a movie it doesn't work, when you play it it just works like it is in the movie and it doesn't move, so i can't play it again.|0

"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film was filmed at an early age and the editing department was in the throes of filming a few years before when she had to have the courage to leave her home and move away. After a few days, she left home and went back to the UK to make her own film. This time around Betty is on the prowl for a new release and will be released in August at a very affordable price (around $200 for the full set) , so there is no risk of disappointment with it.|0

Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is known today as the Great Barrier Reef. That's a fact. It's just that you have to spend the time of the day doing that. That's a fact. That's what we are all doing. And then we go on the journey to become a better planet. What I want you to realize is we're in a time of a changing world. And as we're talking about that, it doesn't feel like it's going to change much.|0
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . . . the Carpenters have a very good point of view . . . but the point is not to say that they are not worthy of their position (and they're not . . . at all . . . that's . . . because there's too much to say . . . as I said , it's just another example of the wrong way to say it . . . if I go back and read the comments section of this page and .|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
"Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, the idea that there's a love story behind the school yearbook seems pretty appealing to me."" ""What does that mean, like, for a school-aged person?"" ""A yearbook."" ""So you're saying, ""A yearbook is like a piece of paper..."""" ""'Cause the book is not a piece of paper!"" ""It's got a face!"" ""It's just a piece of paper."" ""Oh, okay."""|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably fallen on hard time. So, you have to remember, that if these pictures were made for any of your pictures and not just to be used for any other picture in a particular order, the picture will never get made again. What do you think about that? So, it's not like you're actually going to make that one for the picture, but they can be used in another order, or you could just keep it for yourself.|0
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking it was cool . . . until they said the character I thought they would never see. But no, it turns out, when I was a teen, there's no such thing as cool characters. Like, if you're cool you have to be cool. So that's cool. If it wasn't cool, that's cool. That's what it is about. You're cool. And that is how cool you get when it comes to games.|0

"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way that I wanted nothing more to do with what I was doing and how I would act. I have never had a problem with a film, so I know this isn't about me doing this or that. It is about being a part of a team and how we deal with it. It just seems so much more fun than I have been before. But I think that what I have tried so far is a better approach to what we need to do and how we do it.|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be the most important job he has ever had. I know I'm not the most enthusiastic about it because it was my first time. His first day of work was a big disappointment. I wasn't sure how to respond and what to do after that. I was kind of hoping my boss would be up to speed. The day he called me to come out with a message I had to show him. ""What the heck is wrong with you?"""|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century NYC as an example. We think this is the best of both worlds. I actually saw this on the day that I actually saw that movie, but it doesn’t seem as close to what we’d like to see as we want to see it. We don’t really have the resources we need to see this movie, but I can see how much better it makes the whole thing. What did I just see?|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when it is in Berlin and no one in the railway division can find it, but at least we could get to the main station. Just after 1.30 a train comes to Berlin and it will be there before 8.30am so we'll just be at the nearest station. The train arrives at the station after 10:35am and it runs into the train. We're not going to be waiting for you, we're going straight into your station to be there.|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by the time you got to the end (which will probably be a little late) , you may well be in for a treat when you have a better view of who you're dealing with, and who you will be talking to. But what if you got a different ending? You may find yourself at the bottom of a story. In the end , you have no choice but to come back for more.|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . . ."" ""You're really the first film that you have ever looked at."" This is the first of the films I have seen. ""You should probably get out of this one for yourself,"" said Julie. Julie, who has since left us, said of it that it was the first time that I had seen anything like it, ""I thought it was the first film you ever saw on television."|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's like when you've never watched the movies before and it 's like you just love it when you're in the mood . It 's that kind of film that you're always getting. And sometimes, when I was younger, I loved the films that I had the urge to watch because I didn 't think I liked the ones I did. I really didn 't want to go on the film again. I was scared to go on.|0
"I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best and best things ever! Tuesday, November 16, 2014

Greetings,

Today I want to share some of my very favorite things to tell you about this weekend. This weekend has been my favorite since my birthday. This is one of those stories where I can go all by myself and make up for myself. When I was 14, I was living in Atlanta and decided to move out of the way so that I could take some time to catch up on my reading and writing."|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting that sentiment, so I just hope that you will look at the other items that make them interesting. So here are a couple of tips for getting this piece to your mind in the right direction. 1. Start by taking a look at your friends and family and see what’s there to say. As you might expect, you’ll probably be hearing lots of good advice and suggestions from your friends. But first get to the part where you find it to be pretty cool.|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to make for the movie ""Dune"" and it was a little bit sad because the movie is about a kid who goes to the end of a movie for Christmas. I really hope it makes the movies better. What I really want to say is, if you're looking for the best music videos or movies that will make you feel more connected to the audience than you have been for a few years, then you're a winner."|0

His films are directed by Richard Burton and produced by The New Musical Theater.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me it is a great series of events , events that have happened before and it is good to know that it was there . But I cannot believe that a few events that happened before and this show has been so great ! My wife was very good with me . It was a big deal . We are a couple of years back in the United States , we have lived in Los Angeles , but in this part of the country we have lived in so many different places .|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , which you would probably not. It’s amazing how far we have come over the last 20 years in a decade, with a little over 5,000 of the best crocodiles ever seen. But I would do well to be a little bit surprised at how many of them are not as popular as you might think. I would even say they are very popular because of the incredible number of people that have seen them as well.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Train '. Both were published in English with the title Gunfighter, written in French by the artist Robert Duviot, and the Gun-tire by Henry King. King and Duviot created the name 'Gunfighters,' a name in which Duviot's early style is a mix of American and French. Duviot and King then collaborated on a book 'Wagon Train', which was published as an English translation of the book with Duviot himself, although Duviot died shortly after it.|0
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my name. But this is what I thought was so bad but this movie is better than it looks and has great storyline and great casting. It's so funny. I'm a little disappointed in it but then again I've always liked the characters. It's also the first movie that made me a huge fan. This was a movie I have not watched. I saw it for the first time in my life, but I still don't really enjoy watching it.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange business, I think we were just trying to show off what is really going on and how to make it 's easier to see in this space. It really is one of the most famous and exciting things we've ever had to do, and I was really excited to show it as the first of its kind and the first of this series to be released. It's a beautiful room and it makes the world feel like it's still there.|0
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes at night to have the most wonderful experience ever at night! I would love to do this again but I have no money, so I would just do this again in the summer and then come back and do it again every single year! Today was a very happy day for me as a professional horror fan. I saw that I was not very good at watching horror movies and when I tried to watch more of them I was not satisfied.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing, good production values , great sound mixing. I've also got an idea of how I could make the scene even more interesting. So what I've found is that this is the most interesting scene in the entire Saint series, and I'll get to it with some of my more recent additions. There's also some great dialogue and lighting choices, and also some great lighting setups for the characters. There's a lot to like in that scene.|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that all of the film was based on the original screenplay and no longer would it take on a certain feel. The movie was shot in California, I believe. It wasn't the first film I saw in the late 80's, but I had a friend who was a director in that company who made the film. His film was not shot in California but it was shot on a desert island. It would be a film no one else saw until the very late 90's and I knew it.|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to see it. I don't think I will be a big movie fan. But if the guy that wrote the film had a good idea he would make some kind of movie. And if he didn't, it would be as if it was a comedy. But he did, and he did get to be a great actor. But the fact that you can see it on screen is amazing. How does that make him feel about being an actor?|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . They have been really good to me . I loved them as much as I could, even though I couldn't read them for myself. However, it's hard to find out which one was better, so I decided to put them to the test . I did find something that I think is pretty well known to some of my fellow fans but it's been a long day, so I'm taking it up . . . .|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much has more to do with my character than anyone else. So, what about you? I can't think of any particular reasons why I'm not as good. But I'm confident in the fact I've been in the movies. I've been watching Gilmore Girls on DVD and it has become a favorite movie in my head for the last couple years. But on the DVD it's more about my character.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one he has ever shown. The film was a very successful one at the time of Ford having a lot of experience in the cinema and in the UK. John Ford is a great friend to all the members of Ford Motor Company. He was very supportive of the production and made a number of movies that won a prize in the UK. He made one film and was awarded a medal. John is a very talented filmmaker and has developed a strong working relationship with some of the directors involved in the movie.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the place where men are being beaten up, women being raped, drugs are used and drugs are thrown into the street. The park is just another place that men are being put in a dangerous situation for a little bit and then raped again. The girl is going to have to live through all the rapes. She will probably have to deal with her rapist so it will be hard for him to survive. I know she has been through alot.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, but when you think about that, it’s probably a lot of fun. I’ll spare you this clip, but as I say, it was pretty darn fine, and I really enjoy it. So I think you’ve come to the right place. We met in Sydney in 1999, and I’ve never seen the film before. I’m glad to see it, it was good, and we got along pretty well.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . There's just so many of us here who can't get enough of that . . . and I have no idea if the truth is ever going to be revealed, but we'll see . So, as I'm going on, and you all know it here, I'll be writing a new post for you . . . and this one will probably be better known than any other blog . . .|0
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that would make it into the top 20 or top 30 it is it and it is this is what I have always wanted to see. Not a bad thing if the first movie is not a film but I think if you don't think of the first film, there is no way to get it in the top 15. For the past 6 years I haven't really been thinking about why I was not thinking of the first movie as a film.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist of film I was fortunate to be able to see some of the performances in these films which were done in the early 20th century. At the beginning of this movie you would have to read a few lines to understand the meaning behind the film. You would have to understand why the film is so controversial, and why this film was so well received by people. Why did you want to film this film in such controversial ways ?|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite books, but not so much for me. Two Hands was by far my favourite book of the summer and I don't think there's ever a better story to be found in the collection, so if you're reading it, it probably isn't for you. The book I love the most is A Long Walk To The Stars, written by George Rennie and published by Random House on December 17, 1976.|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into the back of my bag to check it out, and it looked like I'm doing it right, and all I see is a few things that didn't apply to them, and I thought it would work out fine. The other thing I saw on the list was there was a huge line on the side of the wall of the room, and it didn't look very good on the bottom. I was thinking it may have been the wall in there, but I didn't know.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making films about the family and their journey to make the film. As he prepares to film a film of his family, the father of one of his younger siblings arrives in London to attend the funeral of the widow of his parents' father . The father's wife dies at the end of this interview, but she continues her career in television to make the film of his family. While working in the film industry, she made her first commercial appearance on British television.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit that it was a really great film ), because the movie really is great . I think they made it a little better because you just get to see something really great . The main thing, however is that it is also a great movie for those who watch it . There’s also so much in between that’s really interesting . I don’t think any movies can tell us anything more than this . But what if it does ?|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I have a very strong opinion of how it should be . I think that drama and comedy is a core element in many of the shows that I enjoy most but it really has to be about the characters, the storyline and the actors , and I would like to see the cast to be able to take the concept of the show on a whole new path . I think they have all been very good and they have given us a solid idea of what the characters are going to look like .|0
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? For a few minutes of the night, that was one of them. But then the next day, maybe the movie didn’t really do anything as I’d only seen a few scenes from it before that. I was really surprised by how well it moved me and I didn’t really see anything really interesting happening. And I wasn’t really expecting anything that might have moved me, other than that.|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love, because it's been my professional experience to watch the film, it makes for a nice experience. The film is actually a documentary with a very good cast and sound. The story takes place over the last ten years. So there is no real connection between the events of the past and the future. This documentary is very important to anyone who wishes to learn the art of filmmaking. That's why you'll have to buy a ticket to this film.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I made a lot of mistakes in the production but I think it was necessary to make a mistake. I'm not going to accept that as an error , I just didn't know if I should do it. That's why I like to explain my opinion in detail. i'm new to this forum and its been a while I've been around it and i will be trying to make something up about this thread and its going to be a lot better than what i was given.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must have had . I had to write a couple of lines for you to make it so that you didn't think that he would have made it in this film . As a person I did not think he had to do this . I feel I do not deserve to be in the film . But at this time I am sorry for that one bad thing you have done to yourself . But I don't want you to blame yourself. I hope you will forgive yourself .|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't work for me, for the first time , I 'm not sure about it, and I 'm not looking for an excuse , or anything, but I know for sure , I just don't feel like I 've found the answer for you. What I think , it works fine , it 's not a lot . I feel like the same way you do , as you are not that easy to beat .|0
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to help him to get into the pool , so Daffy tries to escape from the duck , and Fudd is caught , but his friends are too scared to let him go. Fudd is trapped in the pool, and Elmer is left alone for the next two minutes, and the situation changes when Daffy gets into the pool . Daffy, however, manages to escape to the duck , and the rest of the group are trapped .|0
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. And although Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd do not share most of the characters, the characters are all very different, so you'll be able to find out more about each. This week's cartoons feature Bugs and Bugs Bunny, while they also include a special guest character (Daffy), Bugs Bunny and Bugs and a new character named Elmer Fudd (who is the mascot of the show). If you have any kind of a clue, feel free to share on social media!|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute film with an extremely funny storyline that I will be sharing more about in this installment. It’s been quite a difficult few weeks for the film so far, and I was very pleased to see how it plays out after Chomps received more than enough feedback from critics. In this first video, I have a lot of fun using my camera and microphone to record some of the most hilarious scenes in this short film and hopefully I will get to share more from it as it unfolds.|0
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Man Who Made a Boy, and in this first look at the film, you can find out more about this character, as you'll get a sneak peak of the first two episodes of the film. You can find out more about them by joining us to watch it live, or simply listen to the trailer and see what we may hear in the future. Click on the trailer to catch it in its entirety!|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
"Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how you should try to convey what you are doing and what it means for us and the characters you 're doing. I hope this post will help others. Thanks, Alan!'' You say, ""Let me put it simply"" -- but when you read that last line, you begin to see what is wrong. You don't even get to a place where all of the action is just plain stupid."|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they are always working towards that end . But, it isn’t always the way that you want it to be but it is always perfect. So we decided to make a little movie for a couple of characters that will definitely help make them work. Let’s start with this character’s relationship with her cousin. In this movie it’s about how their relationship develops. The first scene is from the movie about how their relationship develops.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe there's a very small part of cinema, like the film of Peter Jackson. And it's very much like Hollywood film. And in North American, as well, the Hollywood film is a very strong and beautiful film. And there's something about it that makes it seem as though it's in a different way from Hollywood films. And also, they have a different direction. They're a very different way.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds. I am so sorry for the loss you went through. I wish you would go and get my picture because I can't get to your house so I was scared that you'd come out. I wanted to let you know I was going to go with you for the camera because I was scared we had to go together . I was so nervous. I thought we could do this but I just couldn't because I thought you wouldn't come out.|0
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air for $1.99 or better ? so what's the best movie ever ? I know the movie was great but the only other movie that I thought was better (which was one of the best I have ever watched in this review) was The Walking Dead. This is a good movie that is great but not great. There are too many plot twists and characters that are too many for me to consider it good.|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just the first movie in the King series . This movie is also the first and most recent in the second part of the King trilogy , which focuses on the early years, and is the latest film to be produced by the studio behind the animated movies , which were released in 1980. As for the second part of the trilogy , King of Queens is a short film which focuses on King Arthur in time of war . It is also the earliest and best animated short film to date .|0
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could have put this series on a show! . Thank you very much for your time and feedback . . I can't believe that we've had such a productive week so far , it's been quite nice . I'm so excited that you're finally back in the studio to see our show again . I think we're going to try to make it better this time so I know that you're back . We've been working really hard on the music .|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG docu-series, but never had I seen anything like it and had never watched it with my father. I wasn’t even sure if it was a documentary at all and had no interest in it. So when I saw it online (it’s on Amazon), I didn’t get a chance to read it. (If I had a chance, I’m sure I could have written it down. It would have been nice to be able to find out what it is.)|0
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie I was watching (a movie that I didn't find in The Reader ) was ""The Hunger Games "". I thought it would be better if I sat down and looked into The Hunger Games to read the film. However, I don't get how it would be better to read a movie, read a book, read a movie. Maybe if I read the Hunger Games the movie would make it better. Maybe I just read it wrong."|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 2001. I didn’t see it until one day during the filming of it in 2003. The story is a little bit of the same as this movie. It was the first movie that I had seen on TV, but I never watched it. In the story, we have this guy in the same room as him. He doesn’t speak English and doesn’t have any English in his accent, so I didn’t know what to expect as an English person.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I don't know if she ever said anything like that. I had no idea how I would end up with a picture of her in this movie, so after watching the movie I tried to put it down. I tried to say something, but I had to stop myself. Meredith is beautiful, so beautiful, so perfect. I don't know if we'll ever meet again though, so that's okay.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it turned out to be my favorite thing ever. Here are a few photos I took as I walked along, and I am happy to see I didn’t have to do so many things I never had to do on my own. Here’s the sketch of this sketch:

There you have it. It was not very long. And I don’t know whether I should write this one more than once. But it is a good sketch."|0
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for the most important of everything. There is a lot of information about how to do this but the reason I am giving you this is because you have learned it by experience. In the beginning, there was no idea. There was only a very small group of people to be found. The person with the most knowledge was always around. It is the person who makes the most effort to get it. In the beginning, there was no plan.|0
"1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the best books I would read in this series. If you're ever in an unenviable spot to go out, you can find a book for sale on Amazon . If you haven't already read it, look no further . Here's just what I got so far :

2. The Bizarre Bizarre Bizarre

I think I read about this one too . I can tell you that they're not that good . They're terrible . I mean , they're scary , but ."|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant commentary on it. And it would be interesting if the author would be given a better title, and I would like to think it would be, too. It’s funny that I would be surprised by the film if I had been asked to contribute to a film by another artist. I’d probably rather not be asked to contribute to a film unless it is absolutely necessary so I would not like to.|0
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
"Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever heard of! It's about a girl in an abandoned house who comes to find her lost family and a friend, and she wants to meet them but she wants to learn the ropes to rescue her. ""I love you, girl. I don't know how you can be like me!"" She can't believe she's so young, beautiful and very funny, she doesn't know when she wants to be told."|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' .

Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . . . the best documentary at any film festival I have ever seen . . . I got the pleasure of seeing a film and was taken to see it in New York . . . For me it was pretty much the perfect movie. . . . This movie was not even close to being a documentary—this is not one of my favourites. But this one would have been great to watch if I could have kept it from being a big hit.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . I'm sure they would be impressed. I really like it because it's so interesting. It's a comedy movie, and I loved it! My friend, who has been working on the film since I got back from Italy, said that I would love to have it. I told him that it is very cool because it's so fun to watch. And he thought it was great that he got to watch it. What a great movie.|0
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the trailer is that there’s only one line in the title, with the other two lines taken from the first one. For the first few minutes, I was like “Oh, shit. I forgot I’m having fun.” But then the whole thing took a turn on its head the next day, when two more people walked up to me. They started laughing as they were getting ready to pose. And then they laughed at each other.|0
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death . It has always been so very special to have been a part of something I have seen before . I could not be happier for the people I 've seen over the past five years . I am so lucky to have the people I 've never seen before and I hope I will be a part of something. The first film I was interested in seeing was A Star Is Born . This is one of the best films I have seen so far .|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a big movie star. At the time I thought I'd be a star, but then I 'm not! The following was based on the film's original release date. This is not necessarily the correct year, but a date that fits my needs and my tastes (or lack of one). Monday, May 28, 2015

On the heels of The Walking Dead, I thought I'd put together some great photos to share."|0
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out of the theaters. In my first year at a theater, i did a movie about how to build your camera. It turned out to be a very good idea but it required a lot of work as you were shooting it. The only problem with this was if the camera didn’t have a lens that would work with it on the film. I had a problem and they said they would try another lens but it didn’t work very well.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
"If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I have watched it and I have not seen it. This movie has a really nice acting and production. This is the first time I have seen it so I will watch it and recommend this movie to my friends . I hope you like and I hope you have a great one. _________________""What I would ask you to do, ask for, would not be the right way."" The movie I saw last year had an interesting ending."|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my life. And then I look around to see why. That I am the voice of the greatest show in the history of television. I’d like to be a voice for this. But there are many people who want me to be in it. I don’t know. I do know. But I’d also like to have a voice for this. I would not have been able to write this, but I wanted to.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. In this film , you’re transported back to the old days and into the history of film, where you start a film to celebrate the fact that there are films like this , that’s amazing, and all the movies I had been in over 60 years and I’ve seen before (which I’ve probably never seen before) like this are in the tradition of the British Cinema.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man in a real relationship. It was the first of a trilogy by the celebrated and influential novelist Paul Austen. A young woman and a man who love each other. The film begins with a scene of a married couple having a casual dinner party. As the couple prepare for their evening meal, their faces turn white and they can hardly see each other. The man and the woman look at each other through the glass. The husband and the woman turn their faces toward the camera.|0
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I got a new movie, the news came back that it was. I had to see it and I was just getting ready to watch it and then it was off. I couldn't get the film, but I didn't have a movie on my bucket list. That was the day I got the movie. I'm not sure if it's the film, but in my mind I'm a film fanatic and don't watch any movies I'm not convinced about.|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest film that I'll be keeping my head down. In fact, though I'm not entirely certain how I would react to the premise of this film, it appears to be going through quite a stretch to see if it's enough to justify the film. What the film does, in other words, is it follows some of the '80's film tropes, and in that sense does it have the potential to be one of those films.|0
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw it in theaters but it is not good. I know this may be one day but I can never be positive because I love the way it talks. I hope the review was good enough for me so that I can get a movie that would be better for my tastes. i watched all of the movies for this movie but one was the main one . I was surprised to see it . It is also a great movie . I can not wait to see it in theaters.|0
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has since gone on to do much better than that, as well as become quite successful. In other news, Brooks is going to show off his new collection . It is not the last time that he does a show, but this year, there is still a lot going on with the music. In the past, you would expect him to be a little more ambitious than that, but the new series will have more to offer him.|0
"I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time I watch ""The Man Who Laughs,"" it's like, it's funny, but you can see it, you can't really know how funny it is because of that. I'm just saying it's not as funny as the other movies. There have been many references to the other films, but I've never seen them. There was probably a few in which you just said something that was very funny, and then everyone laughed and laughed."|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world, in which they are the most passionate and influential. She is one of the best characters in all of those movies, a woman with a passion for the story of all of humanity. She makes her mark in the story of every one of the four protagonists, which is the core of the story. This is a story that is set in the world and in which everyone will find a love and affection for each other and for the three of them.|0
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? If so, what would be the point of writing a post about them? What is the point in writing about them ? Would they be the same ? No, but it is the truth. And it doesn't matter if he's talking about Saved By The Bell's post, or just what's in there. If they were just going to have to make him the guy they're after, there's no point in writing those posts.|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about this film ! The film is not bad, but the actors are really bad ! I'm so happy for everyone. I don't know if I'll see it again and I think this one is good. If you get nominated for a film like this and then don't give a damn what people think or what you think about it you should get a Oscar nomination for a very good movie. I think the film is pretty bad, but I think that was the effect of the actors.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's why it's great to know you're in a better place and it's why I can't be alone with you all the way around.

The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , and I’ve watched them over and over. But I still can’t figure out what it’s doing. One thing I’m saying is, I’m still on the right track here because I’m on the right track here. But this time around, I was thinking. I wanted to be able to do this, but it felt so complicated. It’s not as straightforward as it sounds, but it was really good.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
"Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Book of Stories'

When it was released in 1990, the first issue was entitled 'The Stories'

A few weeks after that the second issue was called the 'Fifty Years After'

After that there was another issue called the 'The Great Stories'

It was supposed to be called the 'Storybook'

However, it didn’t come through at all. When the first issue went out of print on 31st November 1991, it was labelled the 'Storybook'."|0
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of the paper. A total of 14 reviewers were not satisfied and 3 reviewers had no other work that met the required criteria. 4 reviewers were not satisfied and 4 reviewers had no work that met any of the above criteria. I found a lot of work that is well worth reading. I feel like this whole process was very stressful for each and every reviewer. If someone else read this, I can't recommend it highly enough.|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal .I had no idea how to view the photos and feel them in the light.The Bad : The camera was awful and there was not enough depth in the photo.But the camera was good and they made me feel I was in the right place.The Conclusion: The photographer was fantastic.The Reviewer : I like his camera because it’s the most accurate way to view the picture. I have not had any trouble on my camera at all, it can be a bit awkward and not very comfortable.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . You can also add it to a list of objects. But, if you think you want to, it will be best to not add it to your list :-P

You might also want to add all instances of your own, so they will be of a sort. You can see in this example, if you try, the first time, an instance will be added. Or, it will be your first time added."|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the episode, Betty wants to go out with her dog and takes her dog to a restaurant that she knows has a dog. The two of them go to their bedroom together and it's a pretty strange moment in the first episode of the second season, the moment when Betty wants to come back with her dog and she's so upset that she's not even going to do anything. It's funny as always and Betty goes with her dog.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the eyes and eyesight for a long period of time, you can do so while working from home.In this video , we explore the challenges involved in working remotely with people who do not have a voice, and it can be a tough journey in a world that has never quite been the same.When we were at the London School of Economics, I was approached by an old friend to work with me. He was also an old man in the UK.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , interesting , a lot of things . It was a great movie . I love what I saw and heard and I have to say its one of my top 5 films . It is a very entertaining movie , it doesn’t disappoint me at all . It is a great movie and if you like movies you’re going to enjoy the movie you’re after . So it is a very interesting movie . I have to say thats a very good movie , very good and interesting .|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead role on the back of a car. The title is based on the film's title, while the movie is directed by Richard G. Kaufman and the film's lead actors have the same title. The title is the same as the movie's title but the title is written differently and different than the film's title, in some instances. As with the movie the title has been taken as a pun and the puns used as an expression to mean something more.|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn , who is so talented it is hard to believe what he does have in common with the movie’s other main character. He is also the only person that can get the right plot point . And yet I thought the movie’s characters were different enough that I would find their relationship to be much less complex than that of Vaughn’s character. As with all the movies I have seen in the last 30 years, I have not seen one of them in this movie.|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one you were looking for! We love you so, so much that we can never stop loving you! You are the best, most beautiful person ever! Thank You for such great love and of course we can't even believe you can do anything else. It is amazing what people have given you so much of, you're so talented. We're so sorry to hear you're not as perfect. You are very talented.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. But I love it very much because of what it shows and all of the characters have it all. There was a time I was very, very excited about going on an epic tour of the world to visit friends and family who I knew I would never reach again. And now I know that there will always be an epic tour of the world to visit everyone in the world. But that’s not the only reason.|0

This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up to many things (in this case, she is an idiot , but in this film, she is actually a badass). The main thing that stuck with me during my time as a teacher, and for a long time in the future, was always that: I’m a teacher, so it was always better to have a good teacher than to have a bad teacher. This is my experience, so there is some difference.|0
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because they will be more than sufficient , but for the first couple of months , I really couldn't find them. ive only seen one and they are good ive got two. The first one was not really good. the other one is better and better than the first. ive got another one when i bought it. this one had a cable. I have to buy it again to have it with cable. ive have to get the second one too .|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
"I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should just shut it down . but it still makes me cry! I'm going to cry, this is for you . and Disney Channel has changed in so many ways : )

If anyone wants to read the rest of the article, I will be sure to come back later . But I will be glad if you will find it . so far I love this movie , but it is too hard to understand why people hate it when it is so easy."|0
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show with her long black hair and thick black skirts. Pa Kettle takes a look behind them, but you can get a good look inside when she gets inside. She has a big heart and has the most beautiful face you'll find on the inside of a kite. There are few things that have been able to make this show so popular for so long . They've got some great scenes and some great performances from the Ma and Pa Kettle girls.|0
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's early years. The story of Dorian Gray is told from his childhood on the streets of Sydney. Gray's first novel was written at a time when Oscar was still around, and it is a story that has long fascinated the modern writer. However, Gray's first novel, with a cast that includes a few of his contemporaries, was not a very good story. Gray's first novel had a very bad cast, and that was a major factor in the writing of his second.|0
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just because I could afford it. I would like to thank all my parents who made me do that. Thanks all for all of your hard work to bring me to Berlin. I would also like to thank a couple of friends who have been very kind in helping me. In the early years of my career I worked for a very short time on my own and then went on to study in Berlin. I was in the United States before leaving to Europe.|0
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) I was wondering if there was some reason I can't have some of these. So I am trying to play a game and try and get the movie to take a shot at it. I can't find a source for the code because it is not a complete game and I can only guess I need to make a copy of it for the movie but this isn't it. So basically I need some help to play the game and I am looking for any help with it.|0
"On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary tells him: ""This is the time of year where you'll get a glimpse of the future. The play is scheduled to run on TV, and I've already written a review of it."" Then a few weeks later the production director says: ""If this isn't good then we'll be back in the office in five minutes or ten."" He says that is exactly the time of year, and so he tells the director: ""I have to get back in there."|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching the footage of the attack, it reminded me a bit more of that time I was here. It’s something I’ve seen in the film and I thought was interesting enough for me to make a point of saying it in a way that no one else could have, but I didn’t like it enough to make that point. The violence at the prison was so serious I couldn’t believe I could see what people were doing.|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort , and a terrific acting talent . Morris Chestnut also plays a tough role in the series , though there are a lot of mistakes in the game , especially in the way the main character is played. Morris Chestnut also gets to develop the characters . I have to say, I have always enjoyed watching the movie, especially in its final minutes . I always liked that this is an action film , if not the most entertaining . The film is always entertaining , even in its final minutes.|0
"Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a feature-length series like the one Fox has produced. The last thing Fox has promised to release is a series of ""short"" short films. I don't know what that would look like, but for the first-timers looking to work together, this sounds a little similar, and I don't think I'm surprised. This time, however, it will look very different, in terms of release and production, than it does for some of Fox's films."|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
"Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's blog. Just to show you what's in it for the reader to see I'm going to assume you're the guy that wrote that cartoon in the first place. Here are my takeaways from your comment:

- You're right that he should have known what's in the cartoon. In fact, that's exactly what I have come up with, in my opinion. It's not something I'd ever read, but at least I'm going to get to it now."|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1

Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following a series of high-end action movies in the late 70's and 80's. It seems to be a good read - there have been lots of bad reviews on Amazon over the years, and a few that seem a tad dated - but the series of movies is basically a collection of action movies with some very interesting characters. This series was set in a small, rural, rural town in India, and it has a number of characters.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I thought about making a movie like it. But it turned out to be an odd one. We’ve all been playing at least once. It was like I was on a roller coaster ride . . . It took me over two minutes to shoot the film in its entirety . . . but when I got to the end of the movie I was so excited that I couldn’t stop. When I started shooting I noticed how many times it seemed like there was nothing there .|0
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series of exercises. It seems to be like the first time we've ever seen a series of exercises before . But in this particular one, we did it again after some practice . That was when the pain really started to subside. I guess I just didn't want to get that pain, or to get any pain in the body that way. If I did it again this time, I would not have the problem.|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a future and it should not happen. It's really not that I'm in the mood to believe that it's a good time to come back to a place like India. It's not that I want to be back, but I do want to be here and have the courage to be here. What's your opinion about what happened in Delhi? I have been living in Delhi since I was 9 years old.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which is set in New York City. ``

In a series of ``mini-series '' that aired around 1989, the `` Golden Age of `` TV miniseries'' - which debuted in the 1990s - was filmed in a basement of New York's New Museum. The scenes were shot in two episodes. The ''Golden Age'' of `` TV miniseries'' - and in many cases `` miniseries `` - has been filmed around the world. It is the most extensive `` miniseries `` in the series."|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as “punk.” This is one of the few genres that were a major influence on the 20th Century, such as punk, hip-hop, and metalcore, and others, such as horror, horror movies, and westerns. A large body of literature on crime has been published around the world, but not much has changed since then. With that said, we should all be happy to share this article with you.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a young, handsome woman, who has two children, and who has just completed her first job at a private health care clinic. “I’ve been thinking a lot about this job and I haven’t looked in so long that I can’t say ‘why not’ to anyone who knows me,” Zellweger said of the new role. “If I could be a nurse, that would be an amazing thing for me.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1

My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and I really enjoy this movie : ) But I am scared because I think that there is nothing nice , I am really not scared, I am really not into movies or tv , but I am like I am in a good time , but I am scared, I am afraid of movie , I am scared of movies , I am scared of movies , I am scared to get the movie to me , but I am scared when I get the movie that I got the best time .|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
"`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , ``'
``'' you will understand why. But if you have a better idea , you will find that the
'' Cell '' is much less 'complex' than the '' Film '' in the Plot. For instance ``''
``''

To understand the film, it is crucial to understand the concept behind it, in terms
of ``''' and the plot itself. In the Plot, there is the ``Cell'' , and the ``Film.''"|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully entertaining series. And in many respects , this series really does feel like the best I have ever seen! But for a couple of reasons , as the plot in this one has changed a bit . One of them is because the characters don't look like they belong there. And one reason they aren't there is because of this change. Second , there are some plot twists to the plot in this one which is very entertaining.|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to infiltrate the underworld and use him as the target of a deadly vendetta. Pando, a wealthy and powerful kingpin, has shown his ability to manipulate and manipulate the world for profit and use it as a powerful weapon. He is able to create a wealth which he uses to gain the advantage he was hoping he would, in the face of his enemies. The goal of Pando and Heath Ledger is to provide him with the opportunity to fight to the bitter end of the conflict.|0
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like In Search of the World and The Wagonmaster

There are two things you can learn from The Wagonmaster in order to prepare for work. First and foremost you will need to find out all the secrets about the Wagonmaster you have to discover in a few minutes. After that, you are good to go. You will need to read all the books and watch them for the next 20 minutes or so. And then you can begin to make an inventory of what you have to learn in each chapter."|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to keep up with the people that come through your door everyday . Like a friend of mine , who would tell me that her boyfriend has been dead for some time in the 90's. I know this because he was really good in that particular way, but it is really hard to put down, since he's not even a friend . What I am looking to get is an account where I go to see someone who has done something big to their life.|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City , by directing and staging a musical that was set up on a farm in New Mexico, near Las Palmas. This story was published in the February 22, 2013 edition of the San Jose Mercury News. In the film's early days, American Indians, in the early 20th century, were known for their love of music, but their culture had changed over the past decade, to the point they were even more popular with tourists.|0
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. But we're not sure how good that is, I guess. For the next half year you're likely to see more of it. If you do, I think you will. It's going to take some work but it might be a good idea if you keep watching that. You can watch the whole thing on Netflix for a week. You can also make it available via Amazon. I'm sure you'll be glad of that and you'll be much more likely to see it.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated by everyone , but for the most part , if you watch one of the cell's videos , you get a sense of what the movies are like. That is why many of you can only watch a few of them on Netflix. The cell is basically the main video game that you play on your PS3. You play the game as you watch it, but if you have the time to watch all of the videos it's just a game.|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotionalism. The two movies I watched this weekend were a thriller, in which the hero is obsessed with the world and the world he has built for himself. This movie is also about his feelings, his relationships and his personal relationship with other humans. In the thriller, he tries to get rid of everyone he has with his wife and kids. In the film, he tries to avoid getting hurt by someone who isn’t he.|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) ,

""If you were not going to read a good film, you would already know the reason of how the film is performed. It is the result of people working in the field. What is important is how they perceive the film and how they interpret it; and in their work, it's a film of great value for the public. What is important is how the artist and the audience interact; and in their work, it's an artistic journey."|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some day in their own little corner of the world. Now, they have found a place to stand their ground and work together with the community.

We are also committed to getting you to your own home.|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1

"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous actor and writer, David Haslem, who directed his ``Friends''. He also made his directorial debut as David Haslem in ``Ride'''''s ``Devil''''. However, this is a rather strange film, not unlike the first ''The Hunger Games'' film, which had no ''D'' or ''C'' or ''H'' characters in it. It was only ''Friends''''.|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film, not a typical horror film, and I would be the opposite. I don’t think it’s a sci fi film. That being said, when I heard that the movie was titled, I really was shocked. I don’t think that was ever going to be shown. If I were to make a point about horror, I think I would be as much a skeptic as that. I think it is not a film I would consider to be a sci fi.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have any major flaws and it is one of Hollywood's most entertaining works . But I don't think you should pay much attention to that film . Herzog did something different and made a much more impressive film . I was really enjoying this film , but i was really enjoying the cinematography , and even though it is very good , I think it could be better . The cinematography makes it much easier for a film to get its feet in the water .|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . It was presented in 2006. The video will be available to view on YouTube. It is also in the public domain and is available as a live stream on the internet. It was created with the purpose to be one of the greatest music videos ever made to be broadcast on the World Music Network, and by no means the most comprehensive of all possible recordings of popular music. It contains the entire tracklist (list of tracks on the Internet) as well as excerpts and commentary from the live recordings.|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and the movie I saw in it was so much more than that. That was my favorite movie I've seen

I saw it when it first came out, and it's got tons of new characters and some really interesting ideas. So far, it's been great

This is one of my favourite things I've seen in a long time. The movie has some amazing moments, but I have a few of my favorites too. The first one that I watched, it was a good movie."|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I really didn't know how the game got started at all. It's a very interesting thing to watch as it has a very clear message that people have to learn about the game before they start to develop. But I was very excited at how it worked. In my case, I went to work on my new game, the game I have always loved. It is all about the story and everything that comes from it.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years . . . when she was kidnapped . . . and was taken to jail ! . . and is dead . . . , that’s not a lot for an actress to live. That is, unless her family was taken into custody for months. If her parents were in custody for months, she might have no choice but to have the Mona Lisa taken out of her home and taken away . . . . As if the Mona Lisa wasn’t worth the risk.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I remember I got the box set for it and I loved it . It was fun to see it on set and I was impressed by the way it played. I still have this movie and I am happy to play this one . Thank you it is so cute and it’s even better than it was . I have not been able to get out of the plane yet but I want to try this one .|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It was a very fun and thought provoking book about a man who, for the first time this year , has come to terms with his marriage breakup . We have had so many great responses, including one in my series . It really makes me laugh , especially now that I think about a man who has been through a breakup . He has had an amazing time together, and we are very thankful for the opportunity to take this book and to share it with you .|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I thought it was. This is the first time it was featured on the series, and I think I’d like to keep it going! I’m also a huge fan of the horror game “Avengers” because of the similarities I have with the movie. I also love “Scandal”, and this one is by no means a terrible game for the genre, but a great one to watch, because I actually like the characters and their story and story.|0
"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to anorexia, I thought to myself:

“You’re not a virgin. You’re in a very beautiful place . If you’d rather go into your high school you can go to the high school that you’d like to go to. This is what I’m going for: I’m not a virgin. I’m a virgin. You are not in any way a virgin or a virgin by nature."|0

Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and excited to experience the most immersive and exciting experiences ever. The film makes it easy for people to get their bearings about what is happening on Earth and what's on the horizon. Review

It's hard to say where I ended up. In fact, I don't really think you can say it's pretty well done. I'm only really going to say ""Oh, that is pretty well done."""|0
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a lot of excitement. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me of many other films in the past. One of my favourite scenes from it is that of Anne Frank, who came on as a nun at St Paul's Cathedral, to die on a day-long train journey home to be tortured by nuns. She was a very different nun than Anne, I suppose. I felt it was her way of bringing the suffering to life because she did the best she could.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to find out where it really is, but it seems like it's just getting better and better, thanks to some great interviews and a great storyline. But it's also nice to see that the show is still in a very exciting and exciting new phase in the season, and the writers have given us plenty of good characters to tell our stories. It is also worth noting that I'm not sure I'm the only one who said this in the episode itself.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . It makes you wonder whether there's a cure . If it's the cure , then you might just find a better treatment . There are a few people who have them, and there's some who have them, and they make me cry. This is all about making me cry because I want to cry. You may cry, but don't cry at the sight of me crying. Cry when you can see me crying when I'm happy.|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my husband I purchased this DVD for my wife and it has been great to see. I will certainly be making sure to get more than that in the coming years. This DVD has been a gift to me and I am very glad I bought it. I like it because I feel that this movie will be as good or as great as this. This was the DVD for my son. He loved it. I bought it several times but when I got home he didn't seem happy.|0
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up-and-Up.'' It starts with the title, 'A New Way to Die.'' It's the tale of a man and his wife who are forced to take a job that involves killing a woman. He comes in as the head of the household in the first episode, and is eventually shot. After the death, he is found guilty of murder. He is later sentenced to death for his own murder.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two and a Half.' I've always found the series is interesting and the characters and events of the series are rather interesting . The plot is fairly well structured and the dialogue is entertaining . However, it doesn't help that there are so many plot twists . I'd say it is just as much fun to do a 2 and a half series as a trilogy , as that is the first book. This is also a fun way to test your imagination as to what would work best for your characters.|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release is well-known. After a couple of years, and I didn’t watch the movie, a few news reports about the upcoming movie went viral, and we were able to watch it. Now, it’s coming out, and there’s no doubt that the movie will be released by the same company. The movie is available for purchase, and that’s very important to anyone who needs it.|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the last couple of years. So I didn't have a problem in the beginning. I also didn't have to do a lot of research on the subject, but I am pretty sure that you did. I will have to take the opportunity to share this post with more people who want to read it. This weekend, I've been on a trip to New York City, a city I visited a while ago. I haven't even taken pictures, but I'll take them.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to make this a reality. This cartoon is a little cartoon for children that makes no sense whatsoever. The cartoon is called The Big Bang Theory. The subject of the cartoon is not only to how the universe works, but also the universe as it happens. The main subject is how to create a machine that is a computer. The subject of the cartoon is to how to create a computer that can run programs and that can read data and can create software.|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford made it bigger than a picture that had not yet appeared . He used a big picture that was very large . And then he used a picture that was large . I wanted to be able to know what he said about it being large . It would be a little better to use a bigger picture than a little picture . I have been in this game for a long time, and I was very close to the person who wrote that book .|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a great step, but I'm not familiar enough with what they're looking at to see if there's any value in the Commission, and it's not all that interesting. A: I agree that the Commission is the key element in the process. But this is not the case at all! The fact that the Commission has the right to decide whether or not to give you an honest answer at all is why it doesn't matter to you if it's right or wrong.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the past few years but I have decided it will be good if you watch it and if you are an adult you are more than willing to do so. For me it is a fun, interesting movie I love to watch, but I don't understand the concept of the movie. I am looking for someone to share this experience with at the moment, or if you could do so. It would be so nice if the movie would be as well made as possible.|0
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it. I’ve seen it many times before and enjoyed it. I’m still looking forward to it.

POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago but I didn't want to come back , I had never seen it, so I thought I saw this movie but now I thought it was in Paris , because it is an amazing movie , but I didn't have to go to see it in Paris , so if you are interested please give me the link , I will show you it in Paris . I don't want a sequel. It's a little hard to follow.|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1

"There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio. The first part is called ""The Karen Carpenter Story"". The second part is ""The Themes"". The third part is called ""Carpenter's Story"". There's also a scene in the second part of the novel called ""The Themes"". Then there's ""The Aesthetics"". This is a nice scene from the story. This scene was originally written when Carpenters started writing stories, as it's more than a collection of stories, not just one."|0
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few of them ) are more interested in helping people understand how bad reviews can look, what a review is, how a review is written. There’s also the importance of being clear with how the review you’re trying to write actually relates to what you’re trying to say. It’s up to you to decide if it is right or wrong, and whether its right or wrong to publish your review.|0

One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted by French culture in the country. In the country of France, France had many of the most famous films of the year for which the French cinemas were among the most successful. But there were also many of these films that were well received. Here are some of the most famous French films of 2002 . L'égalite la vieille (2001) is a documentary film directed by Claude-Jules Rigney that was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in Paris, France, October 1-19, 2002.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the movie's sound quality and it is very bad , it has a terrible sound and a terrible soundtrack , so it makes no sense for the movie. Anyway I would really like to see this movie more and more . A lot of movies are made using the same sound and performance that they used before. It's a better score than a score like that for me. I would give it a good score for me, it should have good performance.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something new and wonderful and I was so thankful for all of you all who helped me out with my story. I was always looking forward to learning more about these wonderful people, but now i've learned that I want to spend more time with them, so maybe it might be the perfect time for them to get a taste of the magic that is Christmas.

"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is very very good and great acting is really great .

We saw the first one and I was really impressed because this show was really funny . We really got into a really interesting plot . I really liked the scenes . I think I liked the characters . You guys were amazing people that I really loved. You guys were great people .|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren was amazing. A few weeks ago Lauren came back to see my show, my show, my show and Lauren and we were all so happy with what Lauren had accomplished. Lauren really made me happy, and I can't wait for the next book.

Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in many ways, the novel is an entertaining read for those who would like to read it as an autobiography. The author gives the story as an introduction to his band, 'The Band of the Night', which features Karen Carpenter. The Karen Carpenter Story begins with a time in a small town where a girl was born. It is a time for all kinds of things - from getting drunk to becoming a writer. Carpenter's mother is an artist, so she had a very special upbringing.|0
"I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (and hated) it and I was really happy that it was done. Now I'm going to see that I didn't just love it. Heh

I guess the movie is good. If they weren't, how do you not love it, and you'd love it more than the original? And if you don't love it, why do you do that, do you? Because then you will hate it."|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually interesting , and the screenplay was funny. Also I had no problem with the storyline and the tone. I loved the editing. I just had to work out what the final result was really like, if I didn’t work out what was actually funny, and if I went into the script and the final result was the same as the original, then that’s the worst thing I have ever done. I have no idea what the final result was.|0
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most people like it . I’m going to give this a look at how I’ve gotten to this movie, but not too much further than that so it’s not too far off the mark . I actually like the first two parts more than the last. I think there are some scenes which are more important to me than those which I haven’t found as of yet and I think that this movie is the best I’ve had so far.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , I used to watch and see movies. And I had to do this movie. . I remember it was on the night of August 2 , 2003. . What was the story of my childhood? . This is the story of a young woman. . The story was told in an early film, but this story also came from a very early book. When I was 11 years old my father was at work. .|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled for next year or so. It is so entertaining and i love it, and the story has so much in common that I wish they wouldn't have made the show. But i would love to have made it this month but i'm going to keep it because the next show is much more exciting than the first and if it was not for this series i would love it to end up with something like the next, or the next series that would be even more exciting than the first.|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical DVD and I was not disappointed! What I did to the DVD was simple . First off I had to make sure there was an extra DVD (or I have to make a DVD or a film for this) and since I did not have any other DVD I decided to put some extra DVDs on DVD (I have two DVDs of my favourite films in my collection), so I went to Amazon and ordered an Amazon DVD of the movie (with the extra DVD on the right).|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to work together for mutual benefit, a common trait that is not present among the majority. We are told to take up the challenge, and see what it takes to succeed, in a period of two or three years, in a union. But, we should not expect that we would ever succeed at all. This is a new development. Although it is not a new one. I have been working in a long time; I have learned how to get by.|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . It was always difficult for film fans to watch the movie, but now there are some new films and DVDs to be seen . Here is an example of what it looked like to watch a few of these movies at a time , but they are not really what you see today. You can view them online for free , but only if you are looking for some good pictures to watch , not some bad ones.|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point to the franchise, which was released in 2004 . It’s the best movie in its class, and it was a big influence in the development of the classic movie. The movie was directed by John Ford , who was very good in directing the film with a big budget and a good acting talent , and he also directed the film’s main cast . He was a great director, who made it into the movie, but this was a big mistake when it came to directing the movie .|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
"The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed the first two hours)

Why did it stop? How did it come to be there? How would I get it going again? What is the point of getting it going again. I mean, the movie is really good, but the whole point of the movie was that the world didn't stop until it came back. Now the world is going to get really good again, so it is a waste of energy, but I don't have anything like that."|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. It is based on a film by Jules Feffer, who is an American journalist working on a series of documentaries that were released on TV. It’s a story about a police officer in a high-crime state. He goes missing for five days after he was found in the house of a man who is suspected of committing child murder. It’s a very complex series of police cases and it all starts with a guy who is suspected of committing murder.|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a new love story, and the idea of having her have sex with a new woman was so exciting! She was just about the most gorgeous, funny, and beautiful girl I've ever had in my life, and I love her all the time. She looks like a girl I'd never seen a movie like. If I had any of her that was a great choice to make, then I'd give it a go.|0
