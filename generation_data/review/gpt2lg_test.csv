This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so wonderful that it makes me wonder why I don't like it more. It is a great time travel adventure with some very good acting. You can watch this film on YouTube or you could rent it in the big box cinema for around £20. I didn't pay too much attention at first, then saw it when I got home - but I still haven't watched it all the way through because I'm going to be spending a long while in prison (probably next year).|0
"OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I really wanted to see more of her in the sequel , but I didn't think it would be such a good idea to do so ! A few months back I got an email from my brother, asking if I would be interested in getting some of his stuff in DVD format. My reply was simple ""yes"" and went on to list several things that he wanted me to look forward to seeing in the box set (which he had recently given to me as a gift)."|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20. There is a scene where we are asked to name 10 actors, and it goes like this: 1. Jean Seberg 2. Michael Caine 3. James Coburn 4. Robert Duvall 5. Arnold Schwarzenegger 6. Tom Selleck 7. George Clooney 8. Sean Connery 9. Steve Martin 10. John Travolta 11. Mark Strong 12. David Carradine 13. Clint Eastwood 14. Tim Robbins 15. Peter Ostrum 16. Jeff Bridges 17. John Lithgow 18.|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with an old friend (Maggie Gyllenhaal ). I guess I've heard of the original film. I didn't want to buy it, so I waited until the DVD was released last week and decided to see if this new one would live up to its own predecessor's high standards. The first thing I noticed was that all the characters on this movie seemed to have no personality other than what they were wearing when they acted.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it.The director of the film doesn't know if he's ever been to France before or if he even speaks French. And I don't want to say this because I'd probably be laughed out of town, but this film might have saved the life of President Reagan who was a total dud in that film when he first appeared on the screen. He didn't do anything except stare at the wall and make weird noises. Oh wait...that was just him talking.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Geraldine (Jane Fonda) takes her daughter, Mary (Kirsty MacColl), off to college. Mary comes back and finds out that Geraldine has been keeping Mary's parents from their wedding. She then marries Geraldine for $10,000. That is a hell of a lot of money for a 12-year-old girl! I really wanted to like this movie until I saw it. In fact, I thought it would be the funniest thing ever. But it was NOT funny.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in over their heads, and then make a big deal out of it by getting married. There is also an intriguing plot line that involves a young woman who goes missing. The only problem with this flick is that even if you're willing to accept the premise, there is really no way you're going to watch it.It starts with the main hero (Tsuyoshi Tsuchimikado ), a young man whose father died of cancer when he was young.|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Reisner . It is, perhaps, a strange movie, in that it gives you an impression of this kind of film which would not seem possible in our times. As we see it, the real world of the 19th century (in the days of industrial society) is no longer the place where man lives. A new type of civilization has arisen, one in which man takes his destiny in his own hands, and which can now be seen to take full advantage of the technological developments of its age.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For £2.50 it could have been a very good film ! Not bad at all, if you can remember what it was like before the invention of the cinema and the internet. When I saw this film I wanted to put my head through the wall - not just because of the fact that I loved the original, but because I'm a huge fan of 80s horror/sci-fi and this is an absolute rip-off of the '80s series.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , as i never really enjoyed scream and would never give this movie a chance . If you're in need of some good old fashioned, gory thrills then you may like this film. The story is kind of silly and it has a somewhat low budget. What's the point of making a film if it doesn't have value? The special effects are just ridiculous. One scene where a man crawls out of an aquarium is so over the top that it actually makes me laugh.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction, editing and special effects blew my mind . It was an action movie about a soldier trying to rescue a captured Nazi leader from the US. I could not believe that they could have gotten away with using this type of material on such a high profile film . It is pretty much impossible to describe in words what made this film so bad. It started off good but then became worse than bad by the second act.This is a terrible film.The first half was very suspenseful and entertaining as the story unfolded.|0
"This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation, and nothing more. The voice acting is top quality and the effects are beautiful. In this film you get a real sense of depth to the story and the characters. I also like that the story is presented in a fun way and not as an uninspired plot. All in all it is a great animated film with lots of charm. I bought this DVD when it came out on video store shelves because I really wanted to see ""Tangled""."|0
"When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - a whole fleet of ships to fight against us. You are going to have to excuse this horrible film, I just can't find anything positive to say. I really don't know why people are so obsessed with this film. Even though it isn't ""bad"", it is definitely one of the least original films on the list. There is absolutely no reason for any human being to watch this movie. It is boring, slow paced, cliched and stupid."|0
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch it. I had to look away several times just to make sure that my wife wasn't going to get in the way. I saw this movie expecting it to be something really interesting and thought that perhaps they were doing something innovative. I can't believe I wasted so much money on this. I wanted to like it because I think it's a lot of fun, but even though I enjoyed watching it I found it to be an absolute waste of time and money.|0
"The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he met could tell him the truth , so he kept lying about it. I remember seeing his music video on MTV and loved every second . ""Gangsta's Paradise"" stars T.I., Ab-Soul, Big Sean, Juicy J, and Raekwon as young gang members who end up in ""Paradise,"" a drug-ridden gated community that is populated by high-school students. The film is loosely based on Michael Chiklis ' book of the same name, although the plot is far removed from the author's novel."|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch.So I popped in the DVD, checked out the reviews and thought I'd give it a try. What a joke. The guy who plays him has no acting chops and his accent is absolutely horrible. He really shouldn't even be cast in movies. He should have been on an episode of Lorne Michaels show. That guy should be fired from his job because he's just not funny. I hate actors like that! Okay, so it's a pretty good movie.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . Here, we see a much younger Paul Kersey , but one who is no longer as young. He is much thinner, and wears his hair short. He also appears to have a different sense of humor. I mean, if this Paul Kersey was the same person he would have been in the first movie, I don't think it would be that funny. The only ""funny"" thing about the movie is that it's set in Los Angeles (not New York )."|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. This film has everything going for it and yet fails on almost every single level. The story is so bad, you'd think someone made it up as an after thought. There's no real reason to watch this movie unless you're one of the lucky few who already has some experience with horror films. That doesn't mean that you can't have a good laugh. However, once you get there, you'll be wondering why you even bothered watching any movies at all.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. It's not until the credits roll that we get to know this film is actually about Buddy Holly. There are only a handful of shots in the whole film where you might reasonably presume it's about him. The other thing you might reasonably have assumed is that the movie was written by Andy Dick. What I wanted to do from the beginning was to create a piece of music that wouldn't go away no matter what I tried.|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II was good. Unfortunately it was not as good as one might think. The only thing bad I can say about this film is that it wasn't well-written, acted, edited, or directed. Maybe you can get away with writing a few good lines and a few bad ones too, but you need to be more than mediocre to stand out amongst other films. Not all of the characters were funny; in fact, most of the jokes were very predictable and did little to make me laugh.|0
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the previous episode. One of the greatest disappointments to a horror movie fan in the last decade has been A Nightmare on Elm Street. I really can't say I liked it (I guess I do), but it was still one of the finest horror films ever made. The first two seasons of this film were very poorly made, but they are just as much a masterpiece in retrospect. But for all of their flaws, they are also quite funny.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
"By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local authority elections, he managed to win his old seat. At least he didn't lose an election. He's also got some talent. This movie sucks. It was so bad that I could see no way this would become a feature film. The director doesn't understand how to make a film entertaining and entertaining is what good movies do.The plot is so bad it's hard not to think that there must be another one of those ""haunted house"" type ghost stories being played out all over town."|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't all that good and they just don't work as stand out hits. They seem to come from a bunch of different studios and composers and some of them may not even be familiar to the songwriter. For those of you trying to understand what exactly was going on inside the mind of George Carlin, here's an idea: A man goes into the woods for the winter and decides to become a bear - in the forest, of course.|0
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their moments of awesomeness but they are usually in short supply when it comes to horror. In this case I actually thought it was pretty decent. This is one of those rare movies that should be seen by anyone interested in the genre. It has been two weeks and the only thing more painful than waiting for a DVD to arrive is being unable to sit down, eat dinner, watch some television, etc...and then get up and go about my daily business.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes along with the war but then finds out the real reason for it is because the government of the U.S. is stealing money from the German government so they can build a wall around Germany to protect it. This film is very short. You have to go through a few scenes to really understand how horrible this movie is. There is no drama or comedy at all, and even if you did manage to catch some laughs during the movie, it wasn't enough to make up for the awful plot.|0
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Gunslinger Girl is absolutely gorgeous and the plot is quite deep. The characters were very interesting and at the end of this movie all of them had their own stories to tell. There was never a dull moment. The only thing I can say is that you will have a hard time taking your eyes off the screen. You won't like it. I'd give this one 5 stars but it's about as good as watching ""The Godfather"" over and over and over!"|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I watched it with my kids on Christmas night and we had a good time watching it . We got a little scared at some parts. However , I still can't believe that this is the highest rated movie in cinema history ! Well , let's see how it was in real life !The story begins with a very poor man (Milo) getting into a dispute with his boss (Ivan). His boss decides that he has to do whatever he wants to make him look as bad as possible.|0
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G: Reborn'. It doesn't take long to realize this movie was put together by an amnesiac in his 20s who has never made a film. The premise is fairly original and seems like it could work. I hate to be the one to blame but this movie was terrible, if you love Ali G...don't even waste your time with this horrible movie. This guy needs to get his head checked out at least 5 times a day.|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , not an urban legend . If you have ever read about this movie, or seen the previews, you know it is pretty much a knockoff of something else (or just plain ""the same""), and I think they did their best to imitate the look and feel of another movie. The fact that the characters all look exactly alike makes this even harder to like. This is my worst experience with a movie. From what I can see here are two sets of story elements."|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply great film. I was looking forward to this movie for so many reasons. The story itself is simple, with lots of action and no big twist whatsoever. However, my excitement waned as I became more and more engrossed in the characters and their relationship. As the plot developed, it seemed like every second of the film went by in a dream-like state. It was difficult to tell if the characters were dreaming, but even if they weren't, it didn't help matters.|0
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and self loathing. She spends her days with her mother and father but never interacts with them except on the occasional birthday party which she does not participate in. One day she gets out of work early to visit friends in the neighboring country and arrives home to discover her house destroyed by a fire. The first thought is that she must have suffered from a panic attack and it is only when she goes to bed did she realize something had happened.|0
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved, as it is not clear that you can write such a thing in one pass. This film is horrible. I have no words for the level of incompetence this film has. All the characters are awful and all the plot points are completely unbelievable. In the movie they show clips of an actual terrorist attack on the US. It makes no sense how they would even go to such a large city without being able to get hold of their own guns and kill many innocent people.|0
"As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I couldn't stand watching him.I was expecting something a little bit more entertaining and it turned out to be one of those movies where you wait for the end. This movie has been compared to ""Twilight Zone"" but I think it is much better because it was not afraid to push the genre envelope. My guess is that some of the other reviews are from people who didn't see the movie or don't remember what they were like when they saw it."|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom hidden within the show and they will not miss the film. I was so disappointed in the story lines that were told in this movie but it was all good to be true! It's easy to look back at this movie and go, ""OK, so here we go,"" but I'd rather take a moment to talk about this movie for its faults instead.The music is awful. I mean, honestly, how would you come up with such an uninspired sound bite as ""Carry On""?"|0
"`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his best in this movie as he makes a rather pathetic effort to show off his acting ability. I do find it odd that there was so much debate about the ""cure"" (I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the film's title was not chosen to be offensive). While many of the people who saw the movie will probably have been cured by now, for most of them the experience was extremely painful and they can't quite look forward to the next night."|0
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really, what more could you expect? I don't blame them; this movie was one of the biggest disappointments from the last decade. I have never seen a film so poorly conceived and executed with such an inordinate amount of effort (and talent) put into it. The story is totally unbelievable. It has little to no logic or plausibility. The dialogue sounds like it was cobbled together off-the-top of a hat. The acting is bad, the writing is worse and the script is simply horrible.|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any? I am a huge fans of horror flicks. Most of them are so stupid, it's hard to tell if they were meant to be serious or just plain funny (or both) but most of them still do the job. With that being said, I must say that I don't think this film is one of those. I can understand why some people would like it, but others may find it offensive.|0
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I saw the previews before i rented it and i was amazed . It was my first experience with movies on VHS , so that was a pleasant surprise. So , here comes the problem , there is not much to say about this movie . I thought it was pretty interesting , but most of the action sequences were too slow and boring. In fact , all the time i spent on it was wasted. The whole thing just made me lose interest .|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Sanders and Blackmer are quite good, and the story line is intriguing.The only thing missing for me at this time was some music in the film, as I felt it was too slow. A lot has been said by critics about this movie. Many have described it as boring, hard to watch, stupid, silly, or just plain lame. I'll admit that it's all true. However, I can give a positive point of view: The acting was excellent.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop-culture obsession; 2) heavy-duty teen drama; or 3) some kind of juvenile delinquency. This one was all three plus it was just plain ""too cool to be true. ""What really stood out for me about this show is that the creators made it look so easy in comparison to TV shows with more serious stories and themes. It could have been a great sitcom but unfortunately, it ended up as a very disappointing movie."|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes of it I was hooked.The plot of the film centers around a small group of men who spend an entire year traveling the world, attempting to become the perfect man. In order to be accepted, they attempt to become the very best. The problem? There is nobody on Earth better than them. There is not a single good word about this film, but let's at least try to describe what makes this film really bad!|0
"This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but they did not spoil anything. When I first watched this movie on VHS from my childhood, I thought ""this is the worst film i have ever seen"". The story was like nothing i'd ever seen or heard about.The characters were just plain awful; the acting was almost non-existent and the plot lacked any kind of consistency. To add insult to injury, it didn't help that the movie was only two hours long."|0
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
"I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's done terrible stuff, with characters that simply don't do what they 're supposed to be doing, and then it becomes a soap opera. The film I saw is not even remotely good in any way shape or form. Wish I'd never seen the original ""Lucio Fulci"" but I know I did. I guess I liked the movie because of the great Italian actors (Eddy Arrighi, Paolo Dicaprio, Franco Nero)."|0
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... just wish it wasn't such a poor movie ! . It felt like the director wanted to write a bad book, but couldn't because the characters didn't have enough words to fill the pages. This movie is basically one long nightmare of a movie with no redeeming features and absolutely nothing that can be called suspenseful. It starts out with an evil killer stalking a young girl named Kelly (played by Jessica Alba), and after he kills her, she finds herself possessed by him.|0
"Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and Paul Newman, this baddie finally gets the ""good guys"" to be able to defeat him. This film was awful. I was really hoping that there would be something different from the usual Hollywood horror flicks, but no. The acting was uninspired and in some cases even flat. The gore wasn't too bad, but the overall look and feel wasn't as dark and realistic as it should have been."|0
"I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this movie. There's no humor at all (there isn't any humor in this film) and it's obvious the filmmakers were attempting to make one up. I've never thought of making up my own scenes, but what the hell did the writer think would work here? It is a terrible film. If you're looking for a ""Spike Milligan"" spoof, you may be out of luck. He doesn't really have a big role in this movie."|0
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there.It's not like ""The Devil Rides Out"", where the devil is a big bad guy and has his own rules , he can't go to hell (unless you want to be in it, but that's not the main reason). What I'm trying to get at is, why does anyone think they could make this kind of film? Why would anyone think that people would buy this stuff ? It's so stupidly bad!"|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it's just about impossible not to laugh at this film. The movie starts out on a train, which is completely deserted, and we meet a bunch of guys who have gone for a joy ride through the night, and as they get near the train they find something that has been left in the darkness. It took me forever to see this movie. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. The acting sucks. They are all too happy to make the story their little side show.|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) and it is one of the best things i have ever seen... I was so impressed with the acting, direction, and just how funny this show really is that i started planning to watch every episode. And then it hit me ""Wait a minute, there's a good show out there"". I'm a huge fan of all-time classics like ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Farscape"" and ""Star Trek: TNG"", and this is by far and away the WORST series of ALL time."|0
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I got a copy of the DVD from the library. I was very disappointed to discover that the movie was made in 2001. I had never heard of Stanley Kubrick until the book appeared and I didn't think that there were any new insights to be discovered here. Well, you get what you pay for! The story begins when an English woman named Elisha Hunt (Caitlin Krim) goes to New York to write a book about her travels in India and Nepal.|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film, and I wanted it to be a real thing, but alas...it never was. It is now considered to be a classic (or infamous if you prefer).The story is so stupid and unbelievable that it has become an article of faith amongst many ""film buffs"". This movie is only in its first half, which isn't even close to the entire film. First of all, the acting is ridiculous."|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) I even had some friends who wanted to see it before they moved to a city. I was going to give this movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars but I really want to give this one a 7, because if the script and acting is correct then there is no reason why the actor could never do good work again.The director does his job well in keeping the pace of the movie fast. But the problem is that the scriptwriter did not know what to write.|0
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer, nobody would ever guess what she was up to in her private life. One of my favorite films of the 1980's, I've always been a little disappointed that it only got a limited release and has not been picked up by Criterion for DVD release. I'm so glad they finally gave it a chance. There isn't anything like it or similar on the market now, at least not in the form it was intended.|0
"We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a similar reaction to the film, when I showed him it after viewing it with our son. He's only been watching films since the '80's, so we never really ""got it"". I didn't like this movie. Some people will like it and others will dislike it. I am not going to waste my time trying to explain why I felt that way. I just wanted to let you know where I am coming from."|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite being ordered to do so by his superior? It was a good movie, but it was just a piece of crap. This would be a bad movie if it had an interesting story and the actors played their roles like they were real people. There are numerous instances in the movie where you could tell the director or producers had no idea who this guy was before they cast him. He looks like he walks on water, which means he must be someone's son.|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about a gay couple and their son, but after the first 10 minutes of the movie i didn't care that much anymore. This documentary is a good story, but the production value is poor. The actors were fine, but very bland. There are far too many shots of people smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee while sitting on stools and chairs. They could have gotten better lighting. I had read some reviews which said this film showed the real face of homophobia and transphobia in our society.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. The premise of the film is simple enough : there is a man who can turn into any animal he likes, and then he meets his love interest (who happens to be some kind of kangaroo). After they have been together for 3 months, she decides she wants to go back to the land where she grew up, so he gives her a golden opportunity to do exactly that. But what happens next makes you sit back and think 'how could this ever have come to pass'?|0
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both are extremely entertaining shows. In fact, they're the only shows I've ever really been bored by. As much as I enjoyed the original series, The Adventures of Doody was just not that good. Sure, we were treated to some clever plot twists (most of them made more sense once they got a little further into the story), but for the most part, it just wasn't all that great.|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote home village, where she hopes to convince her to give in to her desires. What was wrong with those guys? They weren't smart enough to get a job after they graduated. They were always complaining about how hard it was to pay back student loans. The acting was atrocious, the plot was too shallow and stupid. The characterizations were not good. I could not think of a single positive thing to say about this flick. This movie was just plain ugly.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . It's the story of one of the greatest explorers of the last century whose ship was lost in the Indian Ocean. He found an island that he named Reunion and then sailed there to find out if it was habitable.It was a long, arduous voyage with some problems, as you know, but the whole thing can be viewed as a great adventure tale. There's lots of wonderful scenes shot on location on Reunion , so if you want to get a chance to see this movie, go do it!|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it was still new. The only reason why I did not watch it with my children was that they couldn't understand some of the dialog. I'm so glad I watched it with my kids. This film is simply a waste of money, time and effort to be put into making such a bad movie. It has zero originality or story line. If you want to make any sort of comment about this film please don't do it here.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also explains why they made the movie in the style of an old Norwegian television series . I am so embarrassed for that movie. I saw it with my mom at the cinema and she told me that she thought it was great. Well, I thought it was terrible. It had nothing to do with the story. Everything was off. The plot was unbelievable. The acting was bad. There was not one ounce of emotion in the scene.|0
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about life on the West Coast in California. It has been written that if you don't write about Los Angeles, then you haven't done well. But it's important to remember that Faulkner lived there from 1925 to 1943. When I was 10 years old, I was given the opportunity to read this book by my grandmother. As an adult, I still cannot understand how this book was possibly good enough for a child (who didn't really know what a novel was at that point).|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three of the five stars were for the actors, but there was nothing to recommend them except that they were funny. This is the movie that has become my all time worst film ever.I've seen hundreds of bad movies here at this site and I still can't decide which one is the WORST. In this case, I have two answers. First, it's very poorly done, so badly executed that the actors look as if they just came out of a wet paper bag.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families and live in an isolated community in Africa. Soon after the arrival, a number of people become mysteriously ill, including the women who own this house. They all die within a matter of days of one another. In spite of the fact that local authorities are not able to trace these bodies, the police are unable to come up with any other lead. What is known is that all the deaths were caused by something unknown.The only thing we have for sure is that there are many mysteries left to uncover.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) in a bad light. It doesn't work. Even if it were true, we're talking about an entire generation of kids who had no idea what the Black Power movement was about or how they were being mistreated by the police. When I first read the description for this film, I really didn't think it would do as poorly as it did. The only reason that I made it to the theater was because I wanted to watch something else.|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
"Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a small girl who was passing through the train station by her own will. At that time , he had committed a number of other similar crimes, mostly involving children. In the last few years we have seen numerous cases where innocent people have been hurt and killed because they looked ""suspicious"" or because they went to the wrong place or happened to be on the wrong time . In those cases no explanation was offered for what could have caused the violence, nor was even an attempt made to make it stop ."|0
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I've done my best with what little information I have found. This show is just not worth watching. First off it isn't funny. The characters are all shallow, unrealistic, and predictable. Second of all you'll see that the show is trying to do too much. You can't really give more than 3 minutes of your viewing time to each episode. That being said this show is one of those shows that you will love but still don't know why you should watch it.|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti's original voice, but there is something to enjoy in these characters, even if the actual storyline of the movie is a bit lacking . In the end, the movie just made me cry. I was very disappointed when I watched it. The main character had such a unique personality. It was nice to get to know her a little bit and hear her voice. Unfortunately, I think the story wasn't that good. I didn't understand the motives of certain characters.|0
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who was in charge of making sure the film looked good didn't get a single script revision, and that left the director with only a handful of lines. This movie also has some of the most annoying performances I've ever heard in a film. This is another one of those films that has nothing interesting or memorable about it. A couple of other directors have come up with better horror movies (e.g. Evil Dead), but even they could have made a decent movie out of this.|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
"The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a good time ! The only problem is it's pretty boring. I'm not saying that the characters in the movie were bad but they had nothing going for them. One of the best lines comes when one of his buddies asks, ""Where did we all get our noses?"". If you haven't yet seen this then stop reading this review. Go right now. No, I don't recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it already."|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll find it. This is a very poorly made, low quality film.I do not understand how the producers of this film were allowed to produce and market it. The characters just don't seem to make any sense. I really don't know what all the writers had in mind when they created this script. It seems to be written on the fly. We never see any evidence of the character's personality. There are several instances of the characters saying things that make no sense.|0
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young, and thought the movie had potential. It's one of those films that you just sort of have to give a shot because you don't want to spoil the experience for yourself. This film took me about an hour to watch before I gave it a pass. First of all, if you didn't go into this expecting any sort of high school drama, you should really check your expectations at the door.|0
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . I am not an expert, and there are many things i have trouble comprehending. But I do understand this film.The story begins when a young student goes to live with his parents after their death. When he finds out that his best friend is also living at the school he becomes very attached to him as well. The main character has a big crush on him. He gets mad at her if she shows up late.|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening evening for the festival and it was a great way to end the night. I would highly recommend visiting with a friend or two if you happen to be in the area. It's an intimate film so make sure you have lots of blankets and plenty of drinks on hand.You're not supposed to talk about the movie but some people do and the conversation inevitably leads up to the fact that one of the women is having a baby.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in 1970, it deals with a couple who are forced to move to Mexico by their parents. When one of them (who may or may not be a cop) goes missing, the cops are on the trail. I saw this yesterday and couldn't believe what I was seeing. It seemed so ridiculous that it had to be real. However, I am a huge fan of Giorgio Moroder and have seen him do a lot of stuff.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz' performance was not for me. She did a wonderful job and I enjoyed the movie, just not the song . Maybe I should listen to the music that came out after the movie ! This is the worst film I have ever seen! It is just stupid. It starts off with the main character saying something along the lines ""there is a lot of people who say they want to do something interesting in life"". And then the screen goes black with no music playing."|0
"I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , it all came off as the writers were trying to create some sort of fantasy . In this case they seem to have gotten it very wrong. I bought this because it was on sale during Christmas, but didn't care enough about the movie to buy anything else for Christmas. But then the movie starts and I'm thinking ""holy s***!"" I am not sure if this movie is supposed to be funny, or something else."|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a slow burn . The music fits the situation very well . I found the acting and script to be excellent . Overall, it was a good flick . I can never seem to decide if I agree with or disagree with what an individual writer or producer is trying to say. This movie is about a man who has his eye on a rich young woman. However he falls for her instead. He doesn't have much money but he does have a few cars which he uses for his job as a guard.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the charm and fun of great Columbo episodes without any of the tedium that comes with a lot of other movies from the same company. If you're an action fan, it will be a treat to see this show, but if you're a sci-fi buff you will find some real problems.I found it extremely boring. I've always thought the Columbo series was very funny and enjoyable. But there are some serious inconsistencies in this show.|0
"If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933, I heard about "" The Phantom Zone "", a very strange and interesting movie which was going to be made but never happened. It all seemed like a big joke, but now I see that this isn't even funny . The plot of the movie was just unbelievable.The only reason why I watched this film was to see what would happen if I were to get killed in a plane crash off the coast of Mexico."|0
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is truly astonishing. There are a variety of excuses being used to try and justify such a low mark, but none of these hold up. This is simply not a great film. The acting is lacking, the costumes are bland and uninteresting, the script doesn't have any sort of sense or depth to it, and there really wasn't anything interesting in the plot.The characters are just plain stupid, and the action scenes consist of nothing but CGI explosions.|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be rather shallow, but it did at least give us a good story. A movie about a bumbling writer and his girlfriend, this movie was written by a comedy writer/director and had a great cast. The acting was pretty good and the production values for a low budget film were great. However, after watching this movie, I still could not wrap my head around why they chose to take out so much of the original script!|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch the channel in the evening, because it offers me something new, even a bit entertaining. But I do not expect anything more from them. They are a mediocre TV production group that does not have the ability to create a quality series with the kind of content I can enjoy. A few years ago I found out that my mother's favorite TV show was about a woman who killed off her husband after they got into a major argument.|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
"Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a doubt the finest achievement of German film and television since the end of the Nazi regime. The story begins in the late 1950's with a retired American doctor, (Werner) who has returned to his old job as a scientist. He finds out that his wife, (Carmen) is pregnant and decides to take a trip back to her hometown in Germany to find out why she is suddenly giving birth. ""I didn't like the first one but this one is even worse!"|0
"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother's House remake by now), I was not prepared for how terrible the entire thing was. First off, the plot is such a rip-off of one of my all time favorite movies, that if you are familiar with it you can't help but think, ""What?"" The characters are so stupid and stereotypical that there is no humor in what they say. I've always had a bad feeling about Michael Cimino's films."|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for reviews. I found only one, that seemed to give it 2-3 out of 10. Well, I guess that made me believe that the negative reviews were not worth it. I have always wanted to make a movie with an Italian cast. Not only did I love ""Piano"" but I also enjoyed the work of Giuseppe Martina. However, after reading this review I cannot imagine how any decent person can recommend this trash.If you like ""Degrassi"", don't bother."|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put you to sleep, unless you're willing to go deep. I had no idea who this actor was or what he'd done. I found out in the theater after I'd left the theatre. I really do not know what made this so terrible. The acting was awful, the story line very contrived and confusing. For instance, how can any reasonable person believe that people are being raped in Iraq? What is there about Iraq to make them think that something bad like rape is happening?|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
"Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be something missing. And I mean that not in the ""what did we actually see"" sense either. The plot is extremely convoluted and it appears to take an almost infinite amount of time to develop. If you've seen any of his films, you know that Michael Cimino is a director with no regard for narrative quality. In fact, this one might be his worst yet. Even though he doesn't have a knack for dramatic acting, Cimino manages to throw in a couple of decent ideas."|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
"I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad and in a lot of sadness . It made me think that movies can be good for the human soul and we all need one to make us feel more than if we did it ourselves on our own
It is such a shame that someone would take time to make such a crappy film.The acting is nothing special at best, not even close to the actors they chose. The story is just so uneventful that it makes your head spinning."|0
"it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight. But it's not that bad. The movie takes place in the city of Parma, in what has become known in the last couple decades as America's ""Pig Capital."" I found this movie on the Internet some years ago but I've been unable to track it down since then (or so I think) and didn't find it until I was looking for a film to rent again."|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
"Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster ride from beginning to end and has everything a romantic movie should have. The acting is superb. There is a wonderful scene where they're sitting together on the porch and she turns to him saying ""I can't believe we were so close"". And there is this amazing scene when she pulls him into the kitchen, puts her arms around him and kisses him:
This movie was all too familiar for me, though it could have been because I had not seen any of the others until now."|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the beginning, but once it did, it got really good. The characters were interesting and the plot intriguing. I actually found myself rooting for one of the characters quite a bit. There's not a single character that is likable in this movie. Every single character is despicable. They're either mean spirited, arrogant, obnoxious, vain, manipulative or selfish. It gets boring after about halfway through when you realize that they don't have anything to show for their hard work other than the money they made.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that it was quite good and very interesting. But the director is not the most talented actor in the world. His acting skills are like those of a drunkard.The whole movie revolves around a family who travels to an isolated, remote location in the country. They come back with nothing except their suitcase. What's wrong with that? How can one person give up everything for no reason? I watched this on a friend's laptop (as well as another friend's) and my reaction was pretty swift.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made. But I also thought it could have been done better.The only real gripe I have is that there were too many characters and it took me awhile to recognize a few. If I had known what was really going on behind the scenes, I would have kept looking at every character as though they were trying to pick up clues for a crime that they didn't commit. What a load of crap.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience, however the actors did an admirable job of portraying their characters in a realistic way. This movie had it's share of problems but they just aren't worth mentioning. This movie has some of the worst dialogue i have ever witnessed in a movie. The acting is pretty awful and there is no real depth to the characters' inner life. The only reason i bought this movie was because of the storyline and i don't feel like wasting my time on something that is bad.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing'. After finding out about this flick, I couldn't wait to go see it! The movie didn't have a great plot or interesting characters. It wasn't too bad of a movie. I liked the story and characters. I was disappointed that they did not follow up the plot with a well-acted sequel, which really would have been much more enjoyable.The actors were very underutilized here. The script seemed to be completely lost on anyone who actually read it.|0
"'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which was not written by Douglas Fairbanks. There are elements of the book in it, but it is an extremely bad movie. I just had a problem watching this. I'm a huge fan of ""Manchurian Candidate."" Well, I've seen all 4 of them. But this movie didn't make me laugh for more than a couple of seconds.The plot seemed so ridiculous, and the ending was so cheesy. I really can't understand how anyone with any kind of integrity would want to watch this crap."|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a great flick , and if you like old-school movies and action films, this one will be just what you were hoping for . What a waste of my time. The special effects are ridiculous. It's not even worth watching in the first place. When you see the opening shot of the plane, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. There is no story whatsoever. How can it get worse?|0
"When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say I thought, ""Wow! This would be so cool to do."" I didn't even know what a ""Daredevil"" was, and as someone who loved the ""Hell's Angels"" series (which is basically about the same type of thing), I was excited to see what they were doing. A good story? Yeah, let's try something better. A great premise? Yep, lets try something harder."|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin's first short, ""A Dog's Life,"" an old dog is given a job as a watchman at a wealthy woman's home and is soon befriended by another dog who lives in the same apartment building.The two dogs have a falling out over their mutual dislike for one another and this causes the elderly woman to make a deal with the man who owns the dog to get her back on good terms. I never saw this movie, probably because of my age."|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling acting, bad special effects, and terrible dialog. I did not expect it to be an interesting movie about a woman trying to get her son back from a cult. I really wanted to hate this movie but I found it amusing. This is another of those movies you see on TV as a kid where they are so far off the mark that when you get to the end you can't believe what they were thinking.|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it very much I was quite disappointed. The film begins with an interesting premise: a group of people have been captured and released by a sinister organisation. The only chance for their freedom is if they are made to kill each other before being returned to their home countries. I saw this on DVD at my local video store a couple of weeks ago. I thought it was pretty good until the end when it took a big turn for the worst.|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
"What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it. The story line from start to finish took us through a series of events that we just didn't see coming at first. I read this review years ago and have only recently come across it on IMDb, though I must say it does hold up pretty well against most of the film industry's ""re-watch"" films. It's not a terrible film...it has a good plot, some great scenes, and is a fun ride."|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen in a long time. As a first time viewer, I can see that this was a very good film. But it just wasn't good enough for me to keep watching it, despite having a feeling that there would be better movies to come out of this experience. One of the most disappointing films i have ever seen.I could not believe how many times this film was repeated. Why do they repeat it so many times?|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and it is nice to have some beautiful locations. But even if I knew nothing about Greece I loved how the characters kept looking like the locals they were supposed to be . The movie is a huge disappointment. You can feel the desperation in the writer's voice as he talks about how bad the situation is for Europe. He does not give a realistic view of the situation, he gives a rather vague one. The plot isn't really explained very well either.|0
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 1 hour, it didn't have the energy of a movie I've been waiting years to see. While Chaplin was famous for comedy and lightness (and he was more than capable of both in this role), this movie did little to satisfy my curiosity. The story is about a young French woman who arrives in Paris to study law. Her father is a rich banker, and her brother is a successful real estate agent.|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be doing anything else. This movie is full of wonderful supporting characters. One of the few movies in the past 10-15 years that has managed to find some kind of critical consensus. A great story with some excellent performances, an all-too-obvious homage to ""The Deer Hunter"" (which is pretty damn good too) and quite possibly the worst script ever written about an animal. I had to look up the cast, as the film is now being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics."|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
"This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be expected from such films. The fact that the ""nativity"" was set in Europe and not America did not help. There are a few things I would like to see changed: First of all, we should get rid of Santa Claus. We don't need him right now (he's too old, there's no way he could take us all on an adventure). Secondly, it would make a lot more sense to have Santa go to Africa."|0
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is lame, and there are only a few likable characters. I guess the producers didn't realize that this show was so terrible that it would end its run in just two more months . I did not watch this film for the same reasons that other people did not watch it- because I have no opinion on it, and/or because I am an avid viewer of science fiction movies. It's just too bad about all of this.First of all, it's hard to say what the title of the film actually is.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . In this film, they told a story in a more intimate way than I've ever had the opportunity to. I can't believe how much of this film has been missed. After reading all the rave reviews that went around, it's apparent that people really like it. There's even a sequel planned. If you're one of those people and haven't seen this already, please do consider it. It is an incredibly beautiful movie. The acting is amazing.|0
"This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really make sense in my eyes.The title of the episode is very misleading, as it doesn't appear to be anything about Columbo, and the ""Columbo"" he plays in the show has no connection whatsoever to the real Columbo...so what exactly is going on? I will admit I went in expecting this movie to be an over-the-top satire of Columbo's world. Well, it wasn't. The movie was so poorly edited that you couldn't even tell what was going on."|0
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY times as if it was the most important news outlet of the time. I think I am the only one that is surprised by this movie's low rating. How could such a well received film be so badly received? Well, don't worry - I can give you some answers in a short while:The story line is absolutely ridiculous. It starts out as a very lighthearted parody of the New York Times and then veers completely off into territory that is more than just a little dark.|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and Richard Dreyfuss ( The Deer Hunter ). It has no plot, just funny characters.The acting is good in most parts, but not so bad that it ruins the comedy.DeNiro and Dreyfuss both have nice voice-overs, but they seem forced to say what they're saying. There are times when you wonder what the scriptwriters were thinking. Just got this one yesterday. I really can't remember where I first saw it, but I'm guessing it was somewhere on VHS or something.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of work are often overlooked and forgotten because of lack of publicity. This is especially true for short films. If you're not a fan of short movies, then you won't like this one at all, even though I was hoping for the best. The acting is mediocre (except for the lead role), the writing isn't as good as what's out there, and it doesn't take off until the third act, after which it gets predictable and loses its charm.|0
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some excellent Italian-language B-movies, and even in Italy there's not a huge amount to choose from in terms of quality. There are some great performances though, which makes it hard to argue that this is one of the worst of all time. I had read about this movie before, but was never interested. I was disappointed when I finally made the trek out to the theatres to see it.It is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is stupid and boring.The special effects are bad!|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a deserted street on the way to see their aunt's grave, at the same time, they're being watched by three guys in black sunglasses. They're standing about five feet away from the camera. It looks like they're just staring at the two of them. This was my first time seeing this movie, but i was pretty excited when it came out so i decided to rent it and see how bad it would be.|0
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to see it again!!! I've heard that there's not much going on in Chicago, a town with so much history that people from everywhere think they know everyone there. If you don't have a car, why would you want to take the scenic drive? The scenery isn't worth the few minutes it takes to wander through. There is no reason for anyone who has been to Chicago since before World War II to bother driving down one of the winding roads that leads to Lake Michigan.|0
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and it's about two teenagers who try to survive a house full of demons. You might think that I'm an old fart for disliking this thing, but I watched it just for the music. The score is really good, from the original song to the extra tracks that are on the soundtrack. But if you want to hear the film, you'll have to buy it. There's no way to see it in any other format other than a movie disc.|0
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do some great work as a director when he has a good script . The actors are good for their age . But the plot doesn't stand out in a way that would help the story . If you're looking for an exciting thriller , this isn't the one to try and watch . My daughter told me about this film because her friends showed it to her. She wanted to see the whole thing, so I watched it with her.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
"This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It's certainly not on the level of ""Mystery Train"" or ""Vacation"", nor are they anything close to that of ""The Phantom Express"". I have never seen a horror film in which all of the actors share one single line. The script is so terrible that I'm sure it was shot at night and then mixed with some low budget editing. There is no chemistry between the two leads and the female leads are almost entirely unsympathetic to the main characters."|0
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULDN'T have happened, but if you were going to take that risk, wouldn't you want a scriptwriter? Well, I can see how this would work. You get a group of kids who all go to school together and fall in love. After a few years they decide to get married. The film is well done with some excellent acting. I really wanted to like it.I was disappointed however when I discovered the author's name was written in red on the bottom left-hand side of the screen.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and their actors for putting on such an amazing piece. I just cannot wait to see this film in full screen ! The music is so fantastic and fitting with the setting, it's almost haunting. I had read all the reviews of this film, but I think I was wrong. As much as I loved the book (which I still would recommend if you haven't read it), I found this film a lot more enjoyable.|0
"If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) I ever saw. Well, that's saying something considering how good ""Carnac"" is. I love Giallo films and this one of the most entertaining as I am an avid reader of Italian crime literature. I found it very odd to see a film where the hero was killed by someone else, but we're not supposed to think it's his fault since he murdered the other killer(s). But at least he could go back home and tell his mother what happened."|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
"In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the sole survivor of a group of people that has mysteriously vanished without a trace. It's up to him to figure out what's happening and save the town, which lies on the brink of extinction. The most recent installment in the action-adventure genre from Brazilian producer/filmmaker Rafael Filipe Oliveira, Antônio (Brazilian for ""little boy"") is an uninspired piece of work that does little to advance the plot. This may be unfortunate, as there's very little else to be said about it beyond its abysmal box-office prospects."|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
"OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just awful. I think that's why there is such a large amount of ""spit fire"" out there. I used to be a big fan of this movie and still enjoy many of the clips I have seen. Unfortunately this has been replaced by something which I am sure is much better. The acting seems to be much worse, they don't seem to be getting any funnier. What a shame because this one was fun from the opening scenes."|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i am very satisfied of what i watched, i will never go back to any other movie again, i wish it was longer because i love this movie! I've spent about 20 minutes watching this movie now. There's no reason for me to stay. It's terrible. It's a horrible, boring, unimaginative excuse for a movie that would have made a much more enjoyable film in any other setting. I don't think there's anything redeemable about it.|0
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another cheap piece of shit. I actually found it refreshing. It was the most realistic portrayal of Bronson I have heard of, and one which did not revolve around any kind of violence or bad acting . It was pretty accurate in portraying his character at a certain point. The story is set in the early 90s and the characters were very much like the ones that came before them. There really is only one difference between this and other Bronson movies.The movie was not funny.|0
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
"probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared (I'm looking at you Alien 2), and bad movies . I saw this film last night and honestly it wasn't all that scary. A lot of people may have seen it a million times but I've never seen it rated that highly because of its awful script and lousy acting. As someone who grew up on films made by MST3K, I found myself quite shocked when I first read about these two ""horrors""."|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your interest and it is very entertaining. My girlfriend, wife and I went to see this with her dad. It was on a Sunday night and there was a big line because the theaters were out of tickets for that night. She gave in and sat in with us, but she didn't seem to make much of an impact on the story. There are some scenes where we actually sympathize with the lead character (we do).|0
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' plot, an elaborate camera movement, a number of different sets, etc.. The same could be done in this film. There is nothing really exciting about this movie. A couple of bad guys (I'm sure that's why they've been sent here) are taken out and brought back to life with new powers by a woman who just happens to be a scientist. That's about all there is to it. This film should be rated PG-13. Why?|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the results. It has absolutely none of the plot, character or atmosphere of the films it's supposed to be a direct sequel to. The characters are shallow and the action scenes look like they were created in Photoshop (except for the ending). This is one of those movies that you can either enjoy or despise based on how much you hate it. I've never seen anything so poorly executed as this flick.|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch movies and tv shows with this one title because I liked the premise and was excited for the movie to be coming out on DVD. Then I heard that it was released on blu ray at a great discount rate, so I went ahead and purchased it. What a disappointment ! A complete waste of money as the movie just doesn't have any story lines or character development.The acting is absolutely horrible, there are some good lines here and there but not much beyond that.|0
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I would have liked it, because it was a lot of fun, with good dialogue. It is so far removed from what we as an audience think our country is supposed to look and sound like, that anyone who tries to re-create that image for us has wasted his/her breath. The actors are clearly not able to act their roles properly. The film is so heavily based on a false premise that it fails to take itself seriously at all.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Hurt 's acting and he delivered a superb performance. I can see why the studio wanted to do it again, with such an interesting idea . The story is well paced and very suspenseful .The cinematography is not quite up to par for my tastes and the film doesn't hold my attention or interest .It could have been better if there were less action , but overall it just doesn't seem as exciting as it should .|0
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original story about two brothers who make a deal where one brother helps his father to steal money.The comedy is not funny, the acting is terrible, the story is not funny, but that doesn't matter because we all love this movie. If you want to be entertained while watching a good film, do not turn your TV on. Watch it at 1:00 am. Otherwise you might wake up at 1:00 am for a nap. This movie is simply awful.|0
"I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. It was one of those ""good"" movies from the 1980s/1990s that everyone wanted to see, but never could. I am sad to say that I had a great time watching it, but not as much as I should have been.This movie is a complete waste of my life. If you want to see a good movie that might just keep your interest after seeing all of the other crappy crap that comes out of Hollywood, this might be for you."|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age by a man who had previously tried to kill him. So, I thought I'd find another Buddy Holly. I don't care what anyone else likes, this movie does NOT hold up. It is an absolute travesty of any sort. The whole thing has zero heart. And the acting is unbelievable. I really couldn't take it for more than 15 minutes. Then I put my head between my legs and fell asleep from pure exhaustion.|0
"I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language can learn something interesting. However, as an adult, I feel that this show is very boring and poorly written. It could not have possibly been better written or acted if it was filmed in New York (as in the original French version)
I really wanted to like this show. But I couldn't. I mean, it starts out good. The story is about two girls who want to become movie stars after watching their best friend get stardom in a local movie theater."|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the soundtrack . It's good but i feel that there are a lot of things that may have been done better . I was hoping for something more . This is definitely not it . Even though i can see why people would take issue with this , i can still appreciate the effort put into it ... if it weren't for the horrible score, i wouldn't have spent so much money on it . Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy a movie that everyone else seems to hate.|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In many ways , it is the best Sabbath album they have ever recorded. And I believe that's about as far as it goes. I've heard all the reviews but I was intrigued to read how people could still be so excited about this album even after such a long time. I've never heard any of these people rave over this album and there's a good reason for that. One reason is that if you listen to their review, you don't hear what others think about it.|0
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do It Again. '' What do we need it for ? Are you trying to get me to go on? I don't even have a clue as to how this movie makes it out into theaters, so I must turn to my friend and ask: ""Where's all the good stuff ?"" I'm just going to quote a couple of lines off the DVD: ""The action is simple. One man fights another man using only his fists."|0
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid is supposed to know everything. I've watched this movie twice and am still not satisfied. The story is terrible, even worse than my own. A 15 year old girl gets kidnapped and held hostage for years until her father returns home one night with $50,000 to help find her. In order to do so, he must travel back in time to see the events which led up to the kidnapping. I have never understood how any sane person would buy this garbage.|0
"A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling comes out. It's a little too close to a real person, but that was not my fault. Just saw this movie after reading all the reviews. Why? I didn't like ""The Longest Yard"", so I had high hopes for this film. And it didn't disappoint! I thought the script was really cool. The acting was alright, the directing was just terrible. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of three was because there are other good films in the genre."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of those people, and I have seen some of them over the years. This movie is completely unbelievable. There are many scenes which would not pass for real life. But it doesn't mean that's what's happening in the movie. Just don't fall for it. Just to put out there: If you want to watch a good horror film with a solid premise but has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, then this might be your film.|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I recommend getting the Blu-ray disc with the audio commentary. This is probably the most informative commentary I have ever had, not only because it was provided by the legendary Robert Stack on his 60th birthday, but also because it covers so many aspects of the movie that are not discussed anywhere else. The fact that Robert Stack was one of the leading directors of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy makes this extra credit particularly important."|0
"I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to comment about this film because there is no other word to describe it than ""hilarious!"" This film is completely ridiculous!It is one of those films that when I watch it will not end. It is so wrong and over the top it just never ends. I can only laugh at these people, who really are incapable of acting. The plot is a load of crap. You don't need to know the story or even understand the name of the actress to figure it out."|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with a little humor thrown in. While this movie is great, it was a very strange film. At first, I thought it was some kind of spoof but as I looked more closely, I found out that it was really intended to be a parody and not a comedy.I have no idea why it's funny but I loved it. My main problem was that they didn't bother making any sense! It was like they just added all kinds of words and pictures and tried to make a movie.|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare treat for me i cant even think of what i did to deserve it. It's amazing how some people can love this film without knowing what it is about. A good friend of mine thinks that they made a comedy out of this, and thats it. This film is nothing more than a bunch of hicks trying to rob a bank. The only problem with this film is that none of them are very good actors.|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in real life, the movie succeeds at its goal but it fails to deliver. I loved this movie because of the acting and the way it was shot. I don't know how you make a movie look that good in your home video with no special effects or editing. And then you have John Travolta who plays a tough guy who just doesn't get it. The story was funny enough but the acting couldn't really keep up with the film.|0
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,`` but is much darker in this respect. I have to say though that, for the most part, they managed to create a believable story line. It's not the action-adventure type thriller, it's more of a psychological drama. When I saw the poster for this movie I felt there were three parts to it. 1) A character from the novel dies 2) His daughter goes off to live on a different planet 4) A scientist/scientist who lives on Mars decides to explore the other planets.|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which is a must see for architects and design enthusiasts, it is hard not to wonder how they can afford to do anything on the scale that they do . The whole film is quite ridiculous and makes us question the ethics behind the way the people who build these places are treated. The film begins with an opening sequence showing a man sitting in front of a computer looking over his notes as he sits in a chair next to his desk.|0
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not I watched the movie only a few days ago , and I am very surprised by how good the movie is .I do not understand what people have to complain about because of this movie . I enjoyed this movie but there were some things that I didn't quite like. I found the plot hard to follow and I don't know what was going on throughout the rest of the movie but I really don't see how it could have been any more confusing.|0
"As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does have some great action set pieces but the rest of the movie seems to meander rather than focus on any one character's development. The cast was decent, but as with all ""superheroes"" there is something off about their dialogue and style which makes it almost impossible for the viewer to connect with them. When a new character joins the cast, or when another baddie has to be killed off, you can usually tell just by his voice what he is going to say next."|0
"`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a small time drug dealer who becomes the hero of one of the movie's better scenes. It's not the most original character in the movie, and I feel he gets more out of it than any real person could. I actually liked this film. However, what really bothered me are the many inaccuracies and blatant attempts to make the story into a ""comic book."" The characters are obviously created with the sole intent to appear as they do on the screen (except for the lead)."|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to grow in popularity , the writers became increasingly pessimistic about the show's quality. The main reason being, that it was becoming obvious that people weren't going to buy it when it was presented as such a grandiose production. This story is so incredibly lame that even the actors don't laugh.I thought the plot was really stupid, I didn't know the characters would act that way, I just assumed they must be some of the dumbest people around.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is funny, but not in the usual way. If you want a good laugh, go to see 'Caddyshack' instead. Well, I watched this movie because I was trying to learn more about Ali G. I don't think anyone who has seen it will find it funny, but people who have seen it will like it much better. The story is very thin. It is made up mainly of stereotypes, such as an alcoholic father (Gethard) and an uptight teacher (Owen Wilson).|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies more than anything so I thought this movie would be enjoyable. After watching it, I'm not so sure about that anymore.The acting is all pretty okay but I can't tell why the plot doesn't make much sense at all. It makes me wonder if the writers didn't watch the show and decided to give it another try. If you are a fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy, then you may love this movie.|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the amount of magic that I had expected. But still, I thought it would be worth at least some watching. However, I can't say I enjoyed the entire movie.The story was very short and did not make me care for the characters. This may be the worst ""film"" i have ever watched! First there is a huge opening scene in a cave with a man holding a baby to his chest as he talks about making love."|0
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more commercial (and far more enjoyable) Chaplin films that came shortly after. There's no plot, no plot development, no dialogue to be found here. I bought this movie as a gift for my girlfriend because we had a good relationship and she loves silent movies. I wasn't really sure what to expect but when the credits began playing I was in despair. After watching it a few times I can say this movie sucked.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been alive, it has always been difficult to figure out how the hell this series got made. You see, while I am absolutely sure that some of Besson's ideas are very interesting and well-paced, he has also done almost everything wrong with his film industry. For one thing, like most directors today, he likes to go off on tangents in the middle of their films rather than making any sense of what he's doing.|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - all for only $20. I'm sure that if the film had been done correctly, it probably could have become a classic. Unfortunately, it does not live up to this quality. The acting in this movie is almost as terrible as the screenplay. The problem is that most of these actors seem to forget that their character was never actually meant to be memorable at all. In fact, they do an excellent job of forgetting about their role in the first place.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since most of the screen- time is taken up by an incredible set, especially the exterior. I have to say that I felt a little bit like I was looking at some kind of antique car. This film is about two people (a doctor and a cop) whose mission is to find out who murdered John Dillinger. There are no other characters except for a man (who plays a piano) who may or may not be the true murderer.|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
"I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself, i think they got it all wrong.. the only thing i can suggest to them is not to continue with their script and just make an original movie instead. It's always sad to see such films. This one takes the cake! It was filmed by a Japanese director, Shunji Iwai, who in the last decade has directed several ""movies"" that didn't work out so well. All of his ""musicals"" have failed miserably."|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been great ) so I liked that about it. Not a good show, to be frank. It doesn't seem like much of anything but a bunch of random episodes that happen to appear on television at certain times. Nothing is really interesting, the jokes are boring, there aren't very many characters or anything of interest happening. The plot lines don't really tie in to one another and just kind of hang there without any sort of closure.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that it seems to be more of an action sequence in the last 10 minutes or so than an actual story. The premise for this show was absolutely amazing, but the execution was dreadful. It was like a bunch of friends trying to write a great TV drama and were forced to use a mediocre script. I watched it when it came back on HBO, and there was not one single line of dialogue that I could find anywhere.|0
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the leading role into a pretty mediocre film. My problem with The Mummy movies is this: most of the characters are boring, uninteresting, or just plain wrong. They never seem like they're having fun. I've read numerous reviews where people said that this movie had a great screenplay, etc. But when I go to see the movie myself (on VHS, no less), I find myself laughing at the ridiculous dialogue, non-sequiturs, and downright bad acting.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. She is the most beautiful of them all, but she is spoiled rotten and doesn't like to get out of bed for fear of being spotted by paparazzi. I thought I was going to give it a 1 star, but as it turned out I had to go down to 5 stars. Not because it's a horrible film, but because it wasn't worth the $7 I paid for it. It just didn't make me smile.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy in his early forties playing a character more like an elderly alcoholic with a temper. I'm not one for cliche and I couldn't believe that this could have been made when it was first published in the late 70's (I think). The ending makes absolutely no sense at all and leaves you completely perplexed. I can't believe this is getting so much love. I actually feel sorry for Michael Caine , the man behind this, he had such a hard time making a movie.|0
"Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an incredible amount of ""drama"". I'm not very good at horror, and I'm not sure why this movie has managed to make its way into theaters. It is a long, slow, drawn-out train wreck with lots of wasted energy and no story. In fact it's really kind of boring. It's hard to believe that one guy was able to get through such a convoluted plot without getting killed. And there is no real suspense (at least in my opinion)."|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
"I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen many others, however this one deserves it's rating. In the first half hour of the movie there are some interesting scenes and some pretty cool effects. However, after the 60 minute mark, the story just fell apart. It was not until the end of the movie that I started to get a sense of what was happening. If you want to understand why Hollywood has made ""The Matrix"" (or at least its sequels), read this book written by the man who made it."|0
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly. This is a film where the viewer can see and feel everything. The actors play with their own emotions in a more realistic way than what we usually see in movies these days. As I've always said (or at least thought) but never written, it is impossible to describe a film without saying that it is too good. It has to be amazing to be boring. Of course, the best possible movie is one that gets no attention.|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this movie on a friend's DVD rental and thought it was the greatest film he'd seen. (The only problem was that the DVD came with a full hour of the original film!) I watched the film twice and even took the trouble to listen to all three audio-tracks while viewing the film. The action was excellent, the characters were likable, the story had some good twists & turns, and the direction was very good.|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage and makes it seem like you are watching the concert from an airplane, or on an air trip. I was surprised by how many different things could be added onto this movie. The plot of this film would be very interesting to watch: A group of friends go out in search of their high school idol. They are given the task of tracking him down in the desert. The story isn't very good, it's pretty predictable but the acting is just awful.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in a non-violent way. It's a pretty good example of how to do a children's cartoon. It would be a great idea to have this on TV one more time, but alas, this is not an option. The movie is quite forgettable; you could easily watch it twice if you didn't mind re-winding and re-listening every so often. At times it seems like there are only a few moments where the story picks up.I can't believe why this was made.|0
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very interesting piece of cinema, if you are into fairy tales as a genre. I watched it and found myself laughing several times. You see a bunch of young children playing by a lake with a magical tree that grows from their bodies.The story has a good beginning, but falls apart pretty quick. It does have a nice twist at the end, but it never really makes sense. The characters are quite shallow, not much depth there, especially compared to the rest of the films.|0
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described this movie to my friends, but still it doesn't mean I won't see it. I was so expecting a good comedy from these guys, because the last one I watched was crap. But hey, I guess they are just trying to do something else with their careers. It's almost too easy for them, since they have some decent actors as well. The plot is weak, even for an action flick like this, and the supporting roles are not much of anything.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell his parents about an alien attack, which later turns into a monster. The movie takes place in a desert and the whole movie is dark, boring, and has horrible special effects. It would be great to watch a movie like this on a rainy day but it just makes no sense. There is so much going on that you'll probably miss something. I saw this yesterday and I didn't like it. This film is made up of 1 minute scenes, most of which never make sense.|0
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things of what I found there. I've read a lot of bad horror movies. Some are good, some are worse. I don't like bad movies, but I really like bad horror movies. That was not my problem at all. The reason I wanted to give this review is because it's probably the best and most well acted horror movie I've seen in a long time.The characters were convincing and the special effects were impressive.|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in to it after my son's birthday party at his friends' house. He told me about it being on television and wanted to see it. I couldn't do that when he showed up so I gave it a try. This movie was made by a bunch of people who had no idea what they were producing. The acting was terrible, the story line was boring, and its plot didn't make any sense.|0
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
"I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . After seeing the movie, here's my take on what it's really about:
The plot takes place in the late '60s, when all of the major Hollywood action movies are shot in Mexico City. The city is so overrun with cocaine that everyone who doesn't work for the police or run an escort agency is running around town doing their own thing (as opposed to having to sell their product to anyone else). This was the worst movie of the year."|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary film . I saw this on TV at one point, it was a movie I had seen before. A few years later I went to see it again with my family and watched it with them. They were able to relate to it because they had been through some kind of similar experience where they found themselves being chased by these things. That is why it is so effective. One thing that stood out to me was that there are no blood splashes or injuries shown anywhere.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who can ride a horse through the snow , a woman who dresses like an old school porn actress , and of course the girls who sing.I am sorry to say that I do not understand some of the words used in this show . They all seem to sound like they are coming out of a movie script instead of being actual words. There are many times that I just don't get it , especially when there are so many musical numbers that I have no idea what the hell is going on.|0
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs . It was made by a man named Brian De Palma and it is really awful. You might laugh but you will not believe what he did to the film. If anyone ever asked me if I would want to make a comedy, then I would have answered in the negative! The worst film I have seen all year.The characters are so unrealistic that they seem to have been constructed from the head of a dead dog. The acting is horrendous and the script is totally amateurish.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's nothing more than an insult to Murphy , DeNiro and every other comedy actor ever . When this film was first released, I read the reviews with awe and disbelief. As it's not often that such an important piece of cinema is so poorly made, I can only assume that whoever directed it didn't do a very good job. There are several reasons for this: First, most of the acting is terrible.|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them have the same character . I really want to give this movie a 1/10, it's not for everybody but I gave it 3 out of 10. The premise is great, the acting was okay but I'm guessing most people won't be interested if they can't get past the boring part in the beginning. The film starts with a man being thrown from a moving train which has been hit by lightning at an accident. He is found dead under mysterious circumstances on top of a train tracks.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. The story is set in 19th-century Spain . I thought it was really well done, and this film is one of the best movies I have ever seen, although not my personal favourite.The plot was interesting from the start and the characters were well developed. However, the dialogs, which seem to have been created for television, are very slow and annoying. This is the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I had no intention of seeing it at all.|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I was ) this will help them. In fact, I hope that some one can get an image of this girl and see what's wrong . As a lifelong horror fan myself (and also being a huge Buffy fan), I had to see this movie. And while I have to say that I find it hard to imagine why anyone would willingly watch it, I thought it could at least add a small dose of comedy into a film that usually has nothing funny to say.So what actually happens?|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission. But the fact that it isn't really a movie about a cop who is killed during a crime scene investigation is what makes it very hard to watch. This was NOT the best movie I have ever seen. I liked the idea behind it (a guy gets kidnapped and has to make sense of the situation before he kills his captors).The execution was fine. The problem was the script. It didn't follow the plot.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot off , explosions , lots of guns being used and it was all done very well . The plot didn't take too many turns , the characters were not given enough screen time and we never got to see the big guy. What can I say, this movie was so bad it was hilarious! I mean how bad could this be? It started off ok with an interesting idea and then went downhill really fast.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are in this movie are so spectacular that you will never want to put it down again! I can't think of another documentary quite like it ! The cinematography is simply breathtaking ! This was a great documentary, but it left out too much important information from the story. When I went to see this film, I immediately wanted to know how the American's got involved in WW2 and what happened to Germany after they did.|0
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
"This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . A good cast. Well done. I will be seeing this for sure. I'm a big fan of the 1980s and '90s, so when they showed ""The Devil's Advocate"" on VHS, I bought it. It has to be one of the greatest horror/thriller movies ever made. And why wouldn't it be? How can you go wrong with Freddy Krueger? Even the most extreme fans of these movies can admit that he's still the baddest thing since sliced bread."|0
"A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the heartache that has come to them. I was very excited to see this movie, but as soon as it showed up I was like ""WTF?!?"" I actually don't know how anyone can say that this movie is about anything at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure the title isn't meant to be taken literally. If you're expecting a love story or some sort of romance between two people, then I'm sorry to say these people are not worth your time."|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see how it would be like. This was not what I expected. It's hard to put a finger on exactly why but I just feel like I've been left with an unpleasant headache after the first hour or two. The plot has some similarities to Star Wars but it doesn't work in any way. I am a sucker for a good old-fashioned family movie, especially when it follows a very interesting tale. Sadly, this is one of those things that just doesn't happen.|0
"Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a scientist who becomes obsessed with a man whose body is turning into flesh that he believes to be possessed by an evil spirit. While searching for this man, Dr. Jekyll and his wife are abducted by a team of paranormal investigators led by Sheriff Harry Landon, played by Bruce Willis . I love ""Friday Night"". I was watching it when I was about 3-4 years old on tv, and my mother always made sure I got some."|0
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest a bit too much for my liking . First thing I do when I open the mail from my mother in law is pull out my camera and take pictures of it. It takes a few minutes before I realize that there is more than just the standard cardboard box in the box. The back of the box contains something which I don't think I've ever seen before, a small silver disk that glows with a slight pinkish light. That's right, it's a radio antenna.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do not believe in CGI for the sake of CGI, and I have never seen anything like this . If you are a fan of B.C. Anderson or Robert Altman, then this movie may just be what you are craving. I don't even remember the first time I saw this movie, but it was one of the first movies I've ever fallen in love with. It is truly a masterwork of cinema. The performances are fantastic, and the direction is brilliant.|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock'n'roll legend Mick Jagger, whose real name was Paul Robeson. The movie takes some interesting twists and turns, but I think its best for what it does not try to be; a musical with music in it . This movie is horrible! It's one of those things you watch out of spite. You're like a kid that gets mad because someone else stole something from your house. You don't want to see anyone else getting hurt as you've had enough of other people stealing from you.|0
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers. For the price of $2.50, you could have just paid someone else to do a decent job. The acting is really bad. And the soundtrack was so cheesy and cloying that by the end it seemed like an old movie with poor sound editing. This makes it impossible for any viewer who isn't from the area to understand the true meaning of this film. I found myself wondering if we were actually in Texas at all.|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
"inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which the art form faces. As far as he was aware, no one is capable of producing films that are both ""artistic"" and entertaining. And for good reasons: they tend not to be well received. I think I've seen this movie about 4 times now. I had a similar experience watching it when it first came out on VHS, so I wasn't too surprised when I saw it on DVD. I really don't like it, but I did like some of its predecessors."|0
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast, this film would have been much more enjoyable if they had worked together on any other part of the series. This film is absolutely terrible. What an utter waste! I am very disappointed by the fact that it was filmed at the National Film Theatre. They could have done something to make it look like a feature film. Instead of trying to do something new, they just copied what happened in the TV series.|0
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . I enjoyed the music that they used in the movie , but I did not get into it . The plot of the film was very thin. It would have been better to have more characters instead of having one for every scene. There is no character development, and we hardly see any of the characters. We only hear each other's voices, and do not see much of their faces (at least during the first half of the film).|0
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and it was only available in video format, the same as most of my DVDs). It's worth watching but if you want to watch an action movie without all the silly dialogue then you will probably not enjoy this film at all. The plot of this film is pretty straightforward... A man with a broken back travels around the world in a wheelchair trying to cure himself of his condition. While traveling he meets some amazing people and gets their help.|0
"Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But he lives in an underground city where there are supernatural beings who can take away your soul and cause terrible pain, murder, etc. I found this movie extremely depressing and thought that most people would find it depressing at some point. I was wrong.This movie makes no sense at all.The story of this movie is unbelievable. It started out by saying that ""the bad guys have been trying to take over New York's streets for two decades and they just don't know how to win!"|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie network and I still have the VCR, so this is a good thing! This movie has no plot, characters or motivation. They just sit around, talk and look bored.The only people who seem to enjoy themselves are the kids. One of the children even comes out with a cigarette in his mouth as he is waiting for the rest of the kids to come in. This film is a travesty. It should never have gone to film at all.|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives. There is no shortage of bad movies, but this one has the worst title I ever heard! This movie should be called ""The Mommy-Moe Movie"". I would say that this was not a terrible movie. It was actually quite good. However, when you see the final product, what does it seem to represent? What is the point of all of these people's lives if they can't even hold a decent conversation with each other?"|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the actors. I'm not going to go in depth about every scene, but let's just say John Lithgow and Christopher Walken deliver an outstanding performance...this was the only movie that I actually laughed with my friends on a Monday evening. I saw this movie last Friday night. I didn't have a problem seeing myself in any of the roles. I also had no problem watching myself get killed off by a bunch of other actors who were supposed to be playing their own roles.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that director Michael Curtiz did not care for the character he was portraying. This film is so disappointing. I'm really confused about why it's a ""feature"" at all, unless they have some sort of sick-o plot twist which I cannot imagine in real life. The story has absolutely no connection with history, let alone any real meaning. The acting is horrible (except for the woman who tries to be funny by calling her son 'Little Nicky')."|0
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent of the CIA trying to save the country from communist revolution. He falls in love with a beautiful blonde who happens to be a communist, then they get married and go on a journey together . I have seen this movie many years later when it was released and it left me very disappointed.The characters are poorly developed, the main character just isn't likable. The action is extremely limited and dull. This film should be avoided at any cost unless one is a hardcore political activist.|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , but I knew nothing about this movie when I got it, and even less so after watching it. The cast is not great, and the special effects don't hold up. And while there is some pretty good action scenes here, they are set-pieces that would make most actors' blood run cold. The plot, as it stands, seems to be about two friends having a drunken argument which turns into a fight between them and ends with one of them getting killed.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but if you like horror movies then be prepared for a bad movie . If you like comedy movies do yourself a favor by not seeing this movie . This movie was awful. It didn't move the plot, it made me laugh at the characters, it kept me guessing what was going on. The main character was boring and had no interesting lines. And the rest of them were just annoying.They all seemed to be playing off each other.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of friends in school and she spends her time reading. When she gets into an accident, her parents send her back to school because they are afraid she is losing her mind. She also tries to seduce the other girls at school . I can't say enough good about this movie. It really doesn't take itself serious . The plot is so lame that it is unbelievable. I saw this as a child and loved it.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . It's like one of those scary horror films you see in movies, that when they close the door you know something is wrong. The acting is awful and the direction is horrible. They had to make the film as slow as they could, because it made no sense. I can't believe there are people out there who actually watched the film, but if you did, then you should give it a miss. If you liked it, then great!|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another film in the genre like this before . So if you want something to pass the time, or some laughs , this is your movie . The acting is decent enough , and the sound mix is great . But im sorry for those of you who cannot make out the spoken dialogue . I really didn't expect so much from this title . This is probably the worst movie i've had the misfortune to see.|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various points. It was one of those things that could have gone so wrong it would be embarrassing to show it again in public. One of the best bad movies ever put to film. From the opening scene there's just something about it that will make you cringe. It's not a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's just too cheesy for me. I've seen far worse than this when it comes to bad acting and awful directing.|0
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place in horror history. This film is an attempt to re-establish himself as a decent horror director by trying to be more original than what he already had done.I have seen this about 10 times since I started going to see it when it came out in 2003. Not only do I find it to be very cheesy and dated, but I find it hard to believe that this was filmed in the same era (1980's?) as the movies we're talking about here!|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave it three stars. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It has absolutely no plot and EVERYTHING is done in a silly way. It's like watching someone walk around trying to memorize a list, and then they go into a library, and read every book they see. The ending was just too bad as well. It had such a predictable ending. What happened to the character who survived? Why were they fighting all of these crazy people?|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it isnt bad at all the only problem is the ending which makes you want to rip out your heart and throw it in a dumpster. I was looking forward to this movie. I've always liked Michael Caine and have watched him in many different films over the years, but I'm not usually one of these people who really likes acting (my favorite kind) so watching this movie seemed like just another boring action flick.|0
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to get a life. Some people in my town who are so self-entitled that they have no sense of humor will never make it in this field, and I don't want them in it, too. I don't think anyone cares enough about science fiction to read such garbage. What's really wrong with it? Where is the good stuff? The fact that it's a comedy doesn't make any difference, does it?|0
"Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the movie . I'm not sure why they called it ""Lies "". I went to see this movie for my daughter and she wasn't into it at all...She said there were too many ""plot holes"". So, I thought I'd check it out with her. Well, I didn't even want to turn around after I saw the preview. The movie just kept getting more and more ridiculous."|0
* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . The last movie had a lot to do with it.The story is nothing special, there are only 2 real characters in this movie (and both are annoying), and the cinematography is bad. There are some shots that are very difficult to see or even understand at least. This was my second viewing of this movie. I like to enjoy movies when I can sit and have a good time. In other words, if it's not great then I don't watch it.|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i just think he has so much fun with it all, as if he is trying to bring the audience along. He is brilliant in every movie he makes. My only criticism would be that there is not enough of him in the movie. This was a very bad movie. The acting was terrible; the editing was poor, the music was generic, and the writing was clunky. It had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.|0
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
"This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for most important movie of the decade) is not a good story, but more of a collection of short scenes, some of which you can't tell if they are acting or just jokes. There isn't a single thing to be excited about, and that includes the music. You'll hear the words ""Ride on Horseback"", ""Sailors"", ""Dive in"" and ""Jump in"", but there are no songs, except for one ""I'm a King""."|0
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film and made the most sense to do. I've never seen this movie, but it sounds interesting.The main character is a professor who has just moved from London with his wife to the U.S.A. He's been looking forward to coming out on the West Coast for some time, when he becomes aware that the local police are trying to deport him back to London. This is a truly atrocious film. This one is no different.|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every woman on screen wearing skimpy clothes or anything like that . The story itself is fine but the characters lack any real depth. To begin with, there are some great actors in this film, such as Tom Berenger, who can play a lovable loser and an all around good person. And then there's Kevin Costner, who is one of the most famous actors you've never heard of, but he has some nice lines here and there throughout the movie.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
"* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was about 8 years old... I don't remember any of it, it was like a long film, maybe 45 minutes. Now, my memory's a little hazy and I've not watched it since... but I think there may have been a ""hidden"" scene that might have made it into the DVD set. Anyway... I'm sure you know what is coming, so go ahead with reading this and enjoy!I'll tell you anyway, this movie was bad."|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really that great in the first place and I'm sorry to see this go so far. A couple months ago I heard about a TV show which had a very creepy woman who lived on the edge of town and killed anyone who got too close. Well, I decided to check it out anyway.It turned out to be a horror movie - called ""Bride of Chucky."" I can't say much about the movie's plot because I haven't been able to find any useful information online about it."|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
"`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers in a dark room talking at each other's ears. They must have had some kind of telepathic rapport, because as they spoke, they kept making eye contact and keeping their eyes on the ground. It started to happen when they reached a certain point in their story that it was becoming apparent that they knew the other two people better than they knew themselves - and this fact wasn't revealed until later. There was no suspense in watching them ""conversate""."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently didn't get any training in comedy or acting, so it's amazing to see how he pulls it off (in fact I can't wait to see this guy in real life!). This is definitely not for the casual viewer, unless you are a fan of the game. This movie starts out pretty good. It has great music and great special effects. However, after about half way through it really starts to come into its own.|0
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film. I remember watching this when it came out on DVD. At first I didn't care too much because it was all the same crap I'd seen on the big screen.Then I watched it again - with subtitles -and there were some scenes that made me wonder how they got the scene shot, which was actually pretty good.The only reason to see this now is if you've already seen it! The only problem I had is that the acting was just so bad and the story was just so weak.|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
"TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime. A lot of people will say, ""Well if these are true stories, why aren't they on the TV?"" I'm sorry for taking so long to post here. I watched this movie a few years ago with my family, and then never got around to it again because I just felt it wasn't really worth watching. It may have been fun at first, but as soon as you get caught up in the story, the film starts to come apart pretty quick."|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read this book to my son after having been introduced to her by his grandfather. I thought that she had a lot of potential as a novel author and I thought that she would have succeeded with this one. In the end, I felt that it was too shallow in its portrayal of the Jewish people. If you are looking for a movie or television show from the 1950s, this is it. This is the only film I have ever seen about the Holocaust and the events that led up to it.|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was so wrong. This movie made my day . It was just so bad it made me sad. The actors were all wasted and the acting was horrible. If you are in the market to see a film like this, then go ahead. Otherwise, I do not want to know anything else about it. I think I've finally done it - watched every episode of 'Bored with the Ugly' on Comedy Central. And I don't even watch that much!|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career up to one song, which they can only perform in this one single video! I have seen this movie once, back in 1974. I was a 17-year old boy and it was really lame. The music didn't catch my eye at all. It made me look forward to the next movie more. However, when I rewatched it recently, I thought that the new songs (the ones that I had been listening to in the beginning) had taken over the film.|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you are going to like it. This film has the feel and feel of an American TV show. The story is told through a series of intercut flashbacks that are meant to be rewatched multiple times. There are few movies I enjoy more than M*A*S*H; it is truly one of the greatest shows ever put to celluloid, but sometimes you find a movie that is boring in its plot and characterization.|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it self. It was one of Hollywood's highest-grossing movies during the late 1960s, which is also the point when I began to wonder why I have never seen it . I know that this is a classic Italian movie , but if you go to the internet (which isn't so bad nowadays and has an excellent collection of films) you will notice how few people ever talk about it. There's a scene in `Sideways' where they're all walking down the sidewalk.|0
"Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written by and stars William Shatner in the title role. At the time of release in the U.S. in 1977, it was considered a box-office flop. The movie went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. One of the saddest moments in ""The Lion King"" (or rather, the saddest moment in all of film history) involves an old man who loses his daughter to a lion. As you might imagine, this results in him going through a series of tragic episodes."|0
"I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was expecting the typical Hollywood ""franchise"" type of film but this is very much original and well done.The movie opens with a police officer, played by Tom Selleck walks into a bar and meets an attractive woman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who introduces her to him. They both talk for a while and then they walk out together. This leads to a few more short scenes before they are caught up in another case that will change their lives forever.This movie should have lasted only 4 hours."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life ),I've been looking forward to this film and finally had my opportunity to see it. And that's exactly what happened. I was really disappointed in the entire film. I think a good screenplay could have made this an even better film. In fact, I think it could have gotten a lot better. It wasn't until I watched the documentary that some of the more disturbing aspects of the book were explained to me.|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of death. When we die we go down and stay there, in a black hole. And then when we reincarnate we start from the beginning again with new eyes. So that when we are resurrected we have to see what's happened. Which is not much fun. This movie isn't very good. I think it's because the story is so poorly told. There is no plot. It seems like a lot of words were written on the screen to give a certain effect.|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira in the Spanish version of Casablanca (1933). She's also done a lot of movies that are better than this one, so it doesn't take long for you to realize that this is not good at all.The story is based on a true event. The movie starts on a Sunday afternoon when a young mother and her daughter, who had been missing for almost a month, were found dead by their father. They had been stabbed in the head and had been sodomized.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is about a kid that finds out that his sister is dead, and he begins to look for her in an abandoned building. There is little action in this one, so I won't give it more than two stars. When I was a kid, I remember my parents telling me stories about all the movies we'd see growing up. They weren't kidding; they didn't know anything about American cinema other than what was on TV (mostly reruns).|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows from all of the great films and I have to agree with the reviewer above that some of it is rather obvious. The actors, the locations, the special effects are all fantastic, but I don't like the story.The characters seem very one dimensional and do not play well in a group environment.There is no dialogue, no action, just two people talking.It also makes you wonder why there is so much violence in the world today.One of the better aspects of this movie is the performances.|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of it until it started playing. I was shocked by what I was seeing. It is hard to believe that when this was released in the 1980's that no one knew how bad this film was. The fact that most of the cast is white made it even harder, and the story has so many holes that it could not have been a serious film. If you are watching it for the laughs, then you are doing it wrong.|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. I saw this movie a long time ago, but it seemed to be put out of order and never got re-rated or re-edited. Now I can see why. This is a complete piece of crap. It is very well-acted by some actors who don't get paid for their performances. The story is awful, full of inconsistencies. It is like a lot of Hollywood movies from the 1960s. This movie isn't much of a comedy.|0
"I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine performance , it would have been worthless . A good movie if you ask me . He plays a con artist and he knows how to deliver the goods . Unfortunately , he didn't get the chance to use that gift . What could be more depressing than watching someone who once had fame, money, power, and influence try to make a difference in society? After reading some of the reviews for this movie on IMDb, I thought it looked like ""the"" worst movie of 1998."|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to be good - it wasn't supposed to be bad. First off, I have to admit I didn't see this until after it had already been green-lighted by the big screen. If you're really looking for a film to laugh at (and if you happen to know that laughing at something is worse than being dead) then this isn't what you should be seeing. It's very well done, in fact.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it and the kids at school hated it. This show sucks and I really hope it never gets to air, it's disgusting. This series is very well known in the horror/suspense community. The premise of a man who can see ghosts haunting his past has gotten a lot of attention from various films and TV shows, which is certainly not surprising given how old it is! But that isn't all the show has to offer.|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the theater for 30 minutes at most so i can't say much. The only thing that could've been done better, if you don't mind me saying so, is to shoot the entire series in color. If not then it's a mess. There are several problems with the plot, characters, dialogue, direction, even the special effects. Every major character has a flaw, some just plain wrong. It isn't as if this were a good movie, but it is a bad one.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could hope for in a bad movie, except for the ending. A very bad adaptation of Robert A Heinlein book. This movie follows the events that occurred in the 1930's following the sinking of the liner SS Titanic off the coast of Maine. It follows the lives of a group of American survivors who lived in New England as the storm washed over their shores. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.|0
"This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for its authors. The first movie in the ""Guitarist's Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame"" was produced and directed by David Hockney, who went on to make many great films. It is difficult to decide whether this movie is as good as the other Hockney pictures or not, because it has none of the charm that others have shown. While the acting is good, there are many scenes in which nothing happens, leading to the impression that the story doesn't really interest the audience."|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ') and found it very interesting and one of the best I have seen in years. This film is a mixture of fantasy, thriller, suspense and psychological horror. The story is really quite silly. All the characters are extremely immature. There is some nice action scenes with gun battles. Unfortunately, the acting seems to be all over the place. It could be said that the actors were not put together particularly well. But this is certainly not the fault of the film.|0
"I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following because of the title. I had seen some good horror and was hoping it might do something good with it. Unfortunately, not so much. The film is extremely basic and lacks in any variety of acting that would appeal to those who actually like to see good acting. It feels very forced and has very little ""wow"" factor. Just a heads up: if you want to make money making crappy horror movies for $3 million, watch this one!"|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
"The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save him. This movie is a piece of crap. The film itself is not very interesting, but the writing and direction make it very hard to watch. If you want to see some cool movies, I would recommend this rather than ""Naked Lunch"". It takes place in the past, which is why I give it 2 stars. A lot of the characters from this movie have been around for quite some time. This also makes it difficult to identify any of them."|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what all but one reviewer have said . I don't think any critic is wrong . This movie seems like it could have come out of an old TV show. It's not, in fact, that bad--it's very good, especially in the beginning. But at this point, after four or five episodes (and about three minutes each), things are going downhill fast.The film starts out slowly, even though you can see the setting right off the bat.|0
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a director on the British TV series Death Comes to Pemberley, but he went on to direct a number of cult-classic B-horror films such as Vampires Are My Friends . While I'm not sure if they're all that good, it's still nice to see a film that actually had some merit, even if it isn't quite as successful as some of the others. If you like slasher films, this is a good one to check out.|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
"Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a very strong female character (like Rosemary's Baby, for example) I found myself thinking ""What if I created a female lead who was actually pretty?"" The only negative I can offer about this movie would be that the dialogue was so cheesy and forced in that it just didn't work. There were times where I couldn't stand what I was hearing and had to laugh as the actors tried too hard to act their best."|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause i didn't watch it when i was a little girl . Not much has been said about this film so I will just make this short and sweet. At the time it was one of the very best horror movies of the summer. This is a remake of an earlier (1990) TV series by Michael J. Pollard which was pretty good. That being said, it seems that there is a lot of blood and gore involved - and the script seems fairly generic.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
"I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind! I remember that night thinking ""that's not real, how could it be?"". I watched the series until the last episode (when I moved away to college) and then dropped it completely. Then I found it on Netflix again and I have been trying to get it off of the service ever since.It is a very funny show with some great characters and I would love to spend more time with these wonderful people and see how far they could get into the future."|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
"I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There were some good lines but the acting was pretty bad . It is sad that it had to end this way. The only reason I bought it on DVD was because I really wanted to give it a chance. To be honest, I felt cheated. I know I am not in the same category as many of the others who gave it a ""10"" or even a ""2"" star, but for what I paid for the thing, I thought it would be ok."|0
"After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to rent this film when I got my chance. There were no trailers for the movie, but I thought that it would probably be very similar to The Fox in the Hounds. But then I realized that the differences were quite profound! First of all, I was thoroughly disappointed with the ""special edition"" of the film. Not only are the original theatrical prints still out on the market and selling for over ten bucks each on eBay (yes, people actually purchase DVDs of this sort!"|0
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as ""Lol, they're making a horror film"". Well, maybe this was just my bad sense. I mean it's easy to laugh when you like a certain movie. But here, I couldn't even keep up. Not because I didn't find anything funny or entertaining about the film. It's just that I found it so utterly pointless and annoying. A few months back I saw this movie from the original DVD release."|0
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers like Richard Lester, James Coburn, David Lean, Douglas Sirk, Roger Corman and others experimented with new and unusual ideas in a variety of styles. After watching this I can only say to myself that no one in their right mind - or brain - would ever produce such trash again. It's all about the gore, the gory sex scenes, the brutal fight scenes. The violence is so real and the gore so gross, I can't help but look forward to seeing it again next week.|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the character's behavior somewhat odd and distasteful especially after watching it again as an adult. I found it very hard to believe that any person would be capable of committing such horrendous crimes with so little provocation. This may sound like a weak comment, but I wonder what is going through most people's minds when they sit down to watch this movie. As I understand the story, a man kidnaps two girls and then murders them in a remote rural area.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie that makes me sad is how many people did not know what they were getting into when they watched this film . This was my first encounter with George Lucas. I had just seen Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope a year earlier, and although I knew who Lucas was, I wasn't really too familiar with his movies. I also had a very bad reaction to Return Of The Jedi, which I believed to have been a sequel to Revenge Of The Sith.|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , it seems, that the only thing keeping this one from making the final cut in Hollywood will be the poor quality of the production values. The special effects were too weak and the acting was awful. I really didn't get the meaning of anything in this movie. What a shame for the film-maker ! I watched this movie with some curiosity, but wasn't so excited to watch it. This movie has all the hallmarks of a 90's cult classic.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with an interesting cast, a good plot and a very intriguing ending. I think you could get away with less than the film's $20 price tag. This movie was bad. The actors were unimpressed, the special effects were weak, and it had no humor whatsoever. There was no romance, or anything that could move the movie along.The acting was awful. Every actor on the screen was terrible. This movie wasn't even a good movie--it sucked.|0
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how many people have read the book and still had a hard time getting into the movie. Wow, so much talent on display here. This is an absolutely beautiful movie with wonderful direction and stunning cinematography. However, the acting was pretty disappointing and the story told in the first half of the film lacked any real energy or substance whatsoever. The plot seems to be taking a break at around the 3-4 hour mark due to the lack of tension.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention and got me hooked . The director did a decent job of capturing the essence of what made the movie so special . You have to watch this movie in order to enjoy it . If you aren't interested in watching movies like this one you'll probably hate them . Not really much to say. The plot is just about as bland as your run of the mill comedy. A guy moves to LA, and his girlfriend marries a guy who is also moving to LA.|0
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this one, but I still couldn't wrap my mind around it. Sure, it seemed like an interesting premise, especially since it could have gone so many different ways. The main character was kind of cute, but she didn't really have any sort of depth, other than that she was a young girl who got her powers by being super smart .I mean, why do you want to be a hero when there are more important things to do with your life?|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be very good. Unfortunately, I couldn't help but wonder about what happened to the other actors after they were dropped off at the airport. When I went to a screening of this movie at the theater, there was a woman sitting in the box seats that looked exactly like my daughter. She was so small and thin that it made me nervous when she came near me. The director didn't make her any larger or give her more of a presence.|0
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but it seems to have vanished from the script.I think this was one of the first movies that came out where they did not have a ghost in the house (which is pretty standard now). I watched this movie without really having an idea of what I was supposed to like or feel about it. I've seen so many horror movies that I can see how this could be very appealing. Unfortunately, my expectations didn't match the film.|0
"OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film .It is one of the best movies I've ever seen that was based on a book by a famous author. This is an incredible movie! The acting is superb, there are some funny moments, and the editing is top notch. So why is it rated as a ""poor"" movie? Why do critics give this movie a 2 instead of a 1? Some people seem to believe that poor reviews mean that the movie is bad."|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was actually the director in charge, it's easy to see why so many people might have taken issue. The main problem with this movie is that everyone involved is horrible at what they do. I love Paris Hilton, but even her talent isn't enough to make this movie stand on its own two legs. Most of the other actors (except for Jason Alexander) are pretty forgettable, which means that the movie ends on a rather lackluster note.|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) was just so good. I think it was one of those rare moments where a movie could be seen from multiple angles and you wouldn't know who was talking to whom or who did what. I can't imagine what they were smoking on set, because they had to spend half of the movie doing that. There was not one line of dialogue in the film that didn't end in some form of laughter. In fact I've never heard anyone talk at all throughout the whole movie.|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ) I did not know much about it. But what I wanted to find out was: how did it turn into a film of this caliber , and what made the whole thing so unbelievable ? In my opinion this movie is actually the worst of the big 3, even if it managed to be very good.I've always been a fan of movies with bad writing and an awful plot, and that's true for this film.The first thing that jumps out at you is just the sheer number of actors involved.|0
"Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of one Dr. Robert Wilson. This film has everything to interest a film-goer, but fails to do so. In fact, most of it is utterly uninteresting and completely unnecessary. If you're looking for an over-hyped Bollywood romance/horror/thrillers that will probably leave you asking, ""Why are they here?"" You won't like this one at all. The directorial team behind these films may have had the talent to create some great things, but they were never able to pull it off with this clunker of a movie."|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
"I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of the characters are so captivating. It makes me want to get out and experience this film again. This may be a terrible movie, but it is an absolute must watch for any fan of horror movies. This is one of those scary movies where you can actually see the actors in their underwear or undergarments because they are all covered in bloody spittle. I have seen this film several times with friends and everyone says the same thing... ""What the hell was that??!!!!"""|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
"Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! The soundtrack is just awful and I have yet to see an original song by any band since ""My Way""! The plot: A group of people are trapped in the basement of a house for five nights and must find a way out with only their wits, wit, and the help of a little girl. All hell breaks loose after a series of supernatural events occur and the group comes to understand the meaning of human life (and the afterlife)."|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
"Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from 18 to 50 years old . All of them have grown up as women and therefore have had to transition into their next gender role. I just watched this show, and I think it is pathetic. I mean it is supposed to be ""reality"" TV? Why the hell did they have so many men on this show?? There are no women in this entire show, and there's a big difference between a real man and a drag queen."|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was expecting something just like her show - but to my pleasant surprise, I found out that it wasn't what I had expected at all!The first season was quite good, especially for the time period we were living in (the early 70's). The second season started off well, but then quickly lost its way. As the series went on, there was never any real development. It seemed as if the writers decided that the story was already done and moved on to other things.|0
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had a great plot, but the episode ended up falling flat because it lacked any sort of humor to keep viewers interested. There are several reasons why this movie isn't very good. First and foremost, there is no point in paying an hour for this type of movie when you can watch much better quality movies at least half-hour cheaper on DVD from other channels. But the real reason I gave this a 1/10 was that the actors look like they are trying to copy each others lines.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind and one of the greatest comic book films ever produced!``
Well, there is no need to add that I have NEVER seen this movie. I was in high school at the time. I did not want to watch ""The Matrix"" (which had a bad ending anyway) so I chose this instead. If you don't believe me, read the reviews. This film sucks. That's just the way it is."|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how a man with such talent failed in his life. Why bother watching this? Well, I have some issues with the acting. There are a few moments where the characters are just not very convincing but it doesn't take away from the film's overall quality.The script is pretty poor and lacks any depth. This is a big issue since the director does a great job of conveying the message of the story to the viewers.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . I had no idea that there were 2 other remakes of this film in the 90's, but they are much more enjoyable to look at than this one. This movie does not follow the original story line at all. To be honest, I was surprised to watch this movie. I didn't have any expectations since I hadn't ever seen the TV series. The acting is great and the script is interesting.|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was allowed to direct this film after he got caught doing the same sort of work with his own films. You could tell this was going to be a very low budget film because there isn't that much going on - all the actors are just standing around, it looks like one of those cheap horror and adventure movies you'd find in the early 70's. This might sound like a good idea but unfortunately it isn't. There are lots of bad jokes, horrible dialogue and no suspense whatsoever.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks and none of them were anything like this . I have never seen such a bad script . The dialogue was almost unintelligible. The story follows a man (Giancarlo Giannini) who decides that he is being stalked by an unknown man with a gun who is killing his family. In order to protect his family, he tries to go on a hunt but gets captured by the man who wants to steal his fortune.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was so good and so weird that I ended up renting it.It was actually quite scary . And it had a very interesting plot to go with it . But I felt as if I could not really care enough about it at all . Especially since I didn't want it to end in the way it was supposed to . It wasn't a good story. Borderline (2014) is an American remake of the English horror classic A Walk in the Woods (1970), directed by John Boorman and starring David Warner.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I enjoyed it a lot . I had hoped that with three new directors , the production would be in better shape. The editing is very poor . It takes forever to find the right shot . The dialogue is very hard to understand . If you're looking for a horror classic, this might be the wrong movie for you. If you have no interest in being scared, please do not watch this movie at all.|0
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and in keeping with the `anti� message of the film. It is quite evident that the director was attempting to portray the anti-establishment philosophy of the movement in a very negative way. This movie was made by people who don't care much for their country. They're not interested in making America great, they want to bring back slavery. The only reason I kept watching was because I had a feeling it wouldn't be a complete waste of time.|0
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever but not brilliant in its execution. The film is an embarrassment to itself. I've heard many of these reviewers praise ""Funny Face"" for its witty dialogue and quirky characters, and that's where I disagree: it's just a cheap joke. It isn't funny or well-acted; it's contrived and contrived-as-hell. Even the jokes are over-written. You'll never remember what the punchline was before it happened, nor will you care what it was.The whole premise of the story is ridiculous."|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that manages to capture both horror and suspense in the best possible way while also being an entertaining film . It's hard to imagine how anyone could have not enjoyed it at some point. The story is intriguing , the acting is excellent, the set-up is perfect. The premise of this movie is about a young guy who decides to take a walk on the edge of a cliff for a little relaxation. When he finally returns home, his father has died and the girl he'd thought was his daughter has disappeared.|0
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes place in the 1930s when the country was in the grip of fascism and the Nazi party controlled the government.The first half of the film focuses on two young Italian girls who were both members of the secret police during World War II. The second half picks up another couple of weeks later when one of the girls' friends returns home from the battlefield in Italy. I'm a huge fan of these movies. I'm not even sure they are as good as the classics such as 'The Exorcist'.|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially, i would recommend to watch it with your girlfriends. The movie starts on a good note and then ends with a twist. In the early 1900s, when I was about 6 years old, an Italian-born American couple made their way into our country. Their story is one of poverty, racism and hatred. It's a tale of love, betrayal and family dysfunction that is so hard to believe.I can honestly say that watching this film was worse than actually witnessing it myself.|0
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by greed, corruption, and the lust for blood. I was somewhat skeptical about the premise, since I'm used to horror movies that take place in places such as Egypt or Greece , not Sicily. It wasn't until reading the script that I realized that the setting didn't really fit with the main theme of Italian history. To be fair, it does have many elements associated with Sicilians (such as their name) that may have been lifted from Greek mythological characters.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it was able to be made in this era. It has everything: action, suspense, drama, comedy, and romance all mixed into one movie. I would love to live in this time period and see this movie. But I can never get around the fact that I don't think it could actually be made in the 1960s, even if it had the stars of the time. There are other movies about the Vietnam conflict that should have been made then.|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me in his work are the contrasts he finds in his life. I was really expecting to be impressed by the film because of what I had heard about it. I was shocked when I came home from work after watching this film. It didn't make any sense. All I could see was a few people arguing, which seemed to have no relevance to the story or the characters. It wasn't so bad that I didn't want to watch it but it did make me feel uncomfortable.|0
Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering of our national spirit '' as they do it . Well I had to give this one a 1. It isn't the worst thing I have ever seen, but I don't particularly want to be part of a TV industry that tries to get me to watch more shows by making me choose between good films and crap television series. This show made me decide not to bother watching anything else on Channel 4.The characters are just so stupid and poorly conceived that they could have been written for a sitcom!|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (although they will probably prefer the latter). Not a bad flick, and not particularly good either.The acting is very good - but the plot is pretty lame. It's basically a couple of guys who just happened to be in the same position in their lives that they are in right now. One guy is trying to make a name for himself in his own way, the other guy is being used by his parents to look after the kids.|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and often humorous performance in this film. It is hard to make out what he is doing, since he is wearing an old-timey hat, but it certainly doesn't look like he has anything to say. He does indeed scream at least once. Buddy Holly's story is pretty interesting. It's just not very well acted. The characters have a lot of holes in them, there aren't a lot of dramatic moments or twists.|0
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the best horror flicks of all time. But I'm afraid that many, many others will not have the same view. This movie has some decent scares but its overall effect is just plain wrong. You might find it entertaining or interesting to watch , but your mind won't be there for two minutes after you leave the theatre. Wow!This was the first movie I really checked out after seeing ""Nightmares from Hell"" a couple of months back."|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The film starts out with a scene showing a car being hit by another car; however, it becomes obvious that there was no real accident involved. There are many more shots of this car going through the landscape. At one point, the car speeds away without slowing down. The camera zooms in on the windshield of the other vehicle. In another shot, a person can be seen running in the opposite direction to the car.|0
"I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it much more had I not seen it as it was so dark and gloomy . The only reason I went through with going to see it was because of the fantastic cast of actors . They were both very nice and entertaining . This movie reminded me of what I thought was a really bad horror film that I watched years back called ""Horror of Dracula"". The characters were awful but at least it was a scary movie. This is not even remotely close to that."|0
"Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of my favorite horror flicks and it would have been even better if they were in it. I didn't want to see ""Death House"" ever again but this movie had a lot of potential. OK, I'm no horror expert (although I am a huge fan of many films), but I was not very enthusiastic about this film. I mean, what's the point of going into the house and seeing the dead bodies on the windowsill when you don't know how to open them?"|0
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about cars and sports cars, but I guess there was some other reason for this film in the end.The actors were great and made the experience quite interesting. In the beginning it seems as if everything is going well , then it just starts to sink in, and the story gets worse and worse. I've heard many good things about this movie. I saw it the weekend before last, so I wasn't exactly expecting much, but I was wrong.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
"This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is a great actor and always comes out on top. He has a great personality and is so charming. But he can be really annoying when he is mad (which is often) and that is how he makes us sit through this stupid story. I did not want to watch the movie because, like some other reviewers here said, ""this movie does not have any depth"". The problem is, despite having a plot, very little character development takes place."|0
"I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so I decided to watch this one as he sat in his room. And boy did that movie make me want to write a song about it!First of all, the name of this movie is totally stupid. My 6-year old said to me, ""You are going to make some people laugh out loud."" Really? You're saying that because your kid can't figure out how to pronounce the name of this movie?"|0
by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his daughter, a prostitute, after an affair with one of her friends. She later leaves him and eventually moves to Miami to live with him. His daughter is pregnant with his child by another woman, so it would be more understandable if they were separated at birth. A lot of people said this show was very boring, but I disagree. It's like a crime drama on ice. We're not going to spend any time on the plot, since most of it is pretty obvious already.|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) she has to rely on the assistance of two mysterious young men ( William Hurt , Jim Broadbent ) who act as mediators between her and her killer. The plot is rather straightforward, but not particularly good. The pacing is very slow and it seems to take quite a long time from start to finish. The only redeeming feature of the whole affair is that in spite of its flaws, it manages to be entertaining to watch.|0
"When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would have an anti-Semitic joke in it. I know, I know, this is one of those movies where it's obvious the director/co-director doesn't believe in what the movie is about or that the cast and crew actually believe what they are saying. After watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" I was absolutely shocked to learn that at least two American soldiers were Jewish. It was so shocking that I immediately went online and Googled all my friends to see how many other people they knew that were Jewish."|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
"I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down today on the DVD. It doesn't work and I don't get any enjoyment from it. It's so boring, the story is so weak. A lot has happened since I first saw this movie back in 1979. The last 15 years have seen a great change in music, culture, and society. I was a 16-year-old girl in 1980 and one of my friends said: ""You could have made this movie today!"". Well, what did I do?"|0
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch! I can't believe I ever saw this film, it was terrible. The writing was so bad that it made me want to throw it in the trash can. The acting was terrible, they should have had someone else play each role. The script was a complete joke, I found myself laughing out loud more than once. I wanted to rip my hair out. I didn't care if I lost the plot or not, I wasn't even paying attention during the first half.|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines have no meaning to me and the story is contrived beyond belief . This film was very interesting for many reasons, some of which are discussed in the reviews. But I feel like there's something missing that makes it worth your time. In particular, as someone with borderline autism (and yes, I'm one myself) I find that the fact that the people in the movie all have different ways of expressing emotions made my mind start spinning.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've said before in other reviews of this movie, i think that a good 90% of the movie is made up of scenes which could have been used to make a really fun 80's cartoon (like Space Ranger) instead of making a crappy sci-fi film with a few nice moments here and there. As someone who doesn't know much about this movie beyond the title, I am not too impressed. It's so bad I don't know how anybody can sit through it.|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
"Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but because it shows that music can be as funny as comedy. In the world of adult pop music, there are few bands who could come close to what the Monkees could do on stage with their crazy antics and ridiculous costumes. First of all - I don't think this movie was meant to be a ""honest"" review of the Monkees; rather, I would like to discuss the film in the context of other aspects of the rock 'n roll history of this country."|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm so glad I did!This movie, while it certainly has its share of problems, actually is pretty decent. It 's got a good story line and some good characters. The problem with this movie, though, lies in its execution.The acting is just too over the top for what it should be. There is really no character development here, and the few scenes where they do get to do a bit of character development are incredibly one-note and unnecessary.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time. This is a sad story. I really can't begin to explain, but I just couldn't bear watching this! The characters were not that funny or original, the plot was extremely predictable and it just wasn't all that compelling. If there's one thing that every movie needs to be, it's suspense. There is nothing in this movie about suspense, at least what you'd find in any good mystery. I watched this movie with my partner.|0
"This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play. I'm a little hesitant to comment on movies, but here goes. In case you haven't heard of this movie in some time, it's definitely not for kids (or anyone younger than 14). At first I thought I was imagining the movie as a sort of ""Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer"" meets ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". But I can assure you it's much more serious than either of those films."|0
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '' for its time) ? Is it that it is just too old? In my own view, I think that this movie is one of the most original in the history of cinematic science fiction films, and a rare exception to the rule. Worst film ever! I don't understand why anybody would watch it. The acting is awful and some of the dialogue is so out of control that it's really hard to remember what they actually said.|0
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly choreographed story, with wonderful acting and the most realistic dialogue from an actor like Mireille Enos. For the record I have never read or seen anything remotely resembling this movie. It looks like all the money spent on advertising went right into creating this pathetic piece of trash. In short, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The storyline is simply that of a bunch of bored college kids who don't fit in anywhere else.|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona comes across as authentic, but unfortunately this was not enough for me to finish the movie. I will say that many scenes were funny but too long to watch in one sitting. This was the third film directed by David Hoberman, the other two being Big Fish and The Wicker Man. He's no slouch in the directing department, either, though there are several flaws here. For one, this film has very little plot, only about ten minutes of it at the beginning of the movie.|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's a great thriller and thriller/comedy/horror but it's also absolutely beautiful. If you don't know what i'm talking about...this movie starts with a scene where some guys are on a road in France. They're driving around doing nothing, when this truck comes from nowhere, crashes into the back of the truck they're in. The guys get out of the van, and the camera pans up to show the dead guy's head floating in the air.|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story was adapted from is probably the greatest ever, but he did not draw a line between his art and reality. One of my absolute favorites. I had it on my DVD player for 2 days straight. I don't know why! It's one of those horror movies that just has to be seen no matter how sick or depressing it gets. The plot is so unbelievable that you can't believe anyone would actually do what they say they're doing.|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
"I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO websites. I wasn't really impressed with it, but at least they let me watch it anyway. I didn't give this film a fair chance in my initial viewing, thinking it to be rubbish. I know what some of you might be thinking - ""that's not true! It's got good reviews!"" Perhaps you are right, if you have any opinion at all. I can't see why anyone would feel the need to heap so much negative energy onto this film."|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce their own TV shows? If I had to guess, it's because there is a large population of talented people out there who really love what they do. There are also a lot of great writers out there who have found that they can get more exposure if they write about something that isn't going to immediately make them a million bucks (see The Walking Dead). I feel sorry for this guy! He should've known better, but he still went ahead and tried his hand at television.|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched high and low for the director's cut (as I'm sure you've done, too) only to find no such title. So, I am going to write this review right here: Don't bother looking up a copy of the director's cut. Go rent it. This is one of the worst movies ever made. One of those things you see once in a lifetime and then there is nothing left to talk about. It's not even funny anymore!|0
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I don't think I am exaggerating when I say it ) and well worth seeing.It is not perfect, for example the two actors seem to be in such bad form as to make one wonder about their sanity, but there are lots of wonderful moments throughout the film and the end result is just as wonderful as the beginning. The acting was excellent, and the script was original and fun. If anyone wants to spend an evening at the Movies, go see it.|0
"where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake - this is a terrible piece of filmmaking. What happened to all the good ideas and great characters ? I must say I was disappointed by this movie. This is not what I expected out of it! I've been watching ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" every Friday night, but I just can't bear to see those two films. So I gave this film a try. However, I was very much hoping for some real twists and surprises."|0
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because he's a master of this type of screenplay. I was disappointed by the end, but that is not the problem here.It is just a really boring movie about two guys who live in a small town and have some weird adventures. If it were made today we'd probably have a lot more interesting dialog. The plot is so unbelievably bad that I can't even begin to imagine what would happen to someone with any sense if they saw it.|0
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . It is very funny and you will really enjoy the scene when they are kissing . Also, I am a big fan of comedies. They are not made to be acted or directed but it is interesting to watch. This movie sucked me in from the first second i saw it and i didn't like it for one second. There were some good points that i liked about the film. The characters were well developed and believable.|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to get into the script with ease, and there's some very good music in it . This movie is just awful. If you have any interest in cinema, then I'd recommend watching this. You may be more interested in reading my book about film than watching this movie.I've seen worse movies in theaters and on video. The main problem with this movie is that it is nothing more than a glorified ad for McDonald's.|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had .I did however see the remake which i was so excited to see. Unfortunately this time it was a mess. The director tried to make me care about the main characters but didn't really succeed in that regard. This film, like its predecessor (aside from the title itself) is awful. It is obviously made by some people who do not understand their subject matter or how it relates to life. It also lacks any substance whatsoever.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think it was supposed to be , and this is the worst possible movie. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the music . It's not great (maybe because I have never heard it) but it has its moments . But, when you're trying to make a bad movie sound like a good one, everything else goes out of the window. A couple friends of mine went to see an old B-movie with this film as the tagline.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the new world ( New York ) . It has all the ingredients of a good thriller, but I was not expecting much more than a decent action flick. This movie is one of those movies that you just know will fail. The entire premise is ridiculous - an Italian man travels to America in order to find his wife and son who are both dead. In the course of his travels he gets involved in various illegal activities with local drug dealers, thugs and police.|0
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I just watched it with friends and laughed out loud when the lead character is shot in the face. This movie could be summed up in a single word--disgusting. Let's start with the plot: Jekyll & Hyde is based on two real life patients who were victims of an experiment that allowed them to live as their opposites for years. The actors are so far over-the-top in this piece that they are actually trying to look like people, which doesn't work well.|0
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling. The story, set in New York at the time of World War II, has all the makings of being good film. In fact it is very well done. But what's really going on isn't just a plot line; it's an intriguing combination of historical events and social commentary. It is impossible to put this film down. I couldn't believe my eyes when the screen went blank. After a couple of minutes I could only imagine the movie would go on for another 10-15 minutes.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect. He's trying to prove that there is something inside him that cannot be contained. The problem is that we see it only as a projection of his personality. I thought I was going to hate this movie. I've seen it a couple dozen times, but each time, it has been so much worse than the last. There's no plot and no mystery. It just keeps repeating the same bad lines over and over.|0
"Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly refreshing to anyone who has not encountered Billy in the past. The characters are still great but the plot and dialogue are very light-hearted and easy going. If you like good camp, you should take a hard look at this movie! It takes place during the American War for Independence (1861) and follows the story of two young soldiers: George ""Old Baldy"" Tarrant (Tarrant, as he is best known, played by Jack Palance) and Jim ""Hickory"" Davis (Spencer Tracy)."|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by all accounts an excellent B movie, I just didn't see it in the same way as many other people did. It started off pretty strong, and ended up being more of a slow burn to me than anything else. That said it was a very interesting and well-shot movie, and for that we should be grateful. This isn't even a great movie. This is simply a horrible piece of crap.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors found themselves stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific, where they eventually had to make their escape by climbing into the boat and attempting to swim across a river to freedom. In this installment, however, we finally get an explanation of how that happened. I have watched this entire show with my eyes wide open and I cannot believe what I'm watching. The acting is terrible. This show is so bad that it should be shown on a cable network.|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper did his best in the role although there were a few problems. Very funny movie, with an old school feel to it. It's got a good sense of comedy, but not as sharp as the more recent films. The acting is OK, so that should be nothing to fret about. The problem comes when you find yourself trying to figure out whether all of the characters are supposed to be from the same town, or whether some of the people in the story are just really weird.|0
"They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan, which was made for little money (around $4 million) with the sole purpose of turning him into a bankable star. The script is by Paul Schrader who has since gone on to write some of the finest crime thrillers ever produced. ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" is one of my absolute favorite movies ever. It is not only a very good piece of cinema, it also has all the ingredients of a great thriller."|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a museum is a stupid, spoiled brat. In addition to not understanding basic facts like gravity and relativity, those who are foolish enough to try this on for real (which I have no idea what it does) are the epitome of life's most annoying idiots. These people must be given an ice-cream cone or something as a punishment for their stupidity. It's just plain embarrassing. This film should be seen by every sane person in America.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
"The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . It's an interesting concept, though the film has too many holes in the story. In the first place, the movie is never explained where the monster is going. Why it came down here or how it can be so far away from the coast isn't explained. I'm not a big fan of this kind of ""buzzkill"" movies. I don't really think I have ever seen a movie that was worse than this one."|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a way that he is never on film. He doesn't appear to be under the impression that anyone is looking at his face, or that he knows what is going on, or that he has to pretend like he isn't seeing anything. His eyes don't look fake or contrived. I saw this as I was taking a nap in bed during the weekend. I had been reading some reviews here and there about it and decided that it should be worth a try.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more importantly they are funny. But as you watch this movie , I realized it is really a cheesy movie . What the hell? How on earth can you call this an enjoyable flick with such bad acting, so many plot twists that make no sense, characters that just have no redeeming value and some of the most poorly written and acted characters I've seen in my whole life. The only reason I give it four stars is due to its ridiculousness.|0
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
"What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here's hoping there are no spoilers. I would rather see that show end, than have people keep thinking ""I'm so sad he's going to die"". The episode was incredibly disappointing. In my opinion, the first 2 episodes were fine, but this third episode fell flat. The story line was just too contrived. It didn't even make any sense as to why we needed to know where each character was going with it."|0
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , I did that in this movie and I never saw any of that funny side. It's all about a guy who wants to have a good time on his college trip with his friends but then meets a girl that turns him into an outcast . But as soon as their relationship starts, things get serious. It's okay to be ridiculous. The problem is if you are being silly or off-color. You can't play both.|0
"Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , such as me , it really was ! In the 1930's there was not one, but two major Hollywood film studios: Paramount and Walt Disney . But neither studio released any successful movies in the mid-1940's. They had no films to make. Both studios were running out of money at the same time so they started making low budget films that nobody saw or cared about. That is how ""Duck Soup"" was born.The original title was ""Odd Couple."""|0
"Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde back into fashion. If you have read the book, you know exactly what's going to happen. One of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while. The cast was terrible and the script wasn't even close to being as bad as it looked. This was a ""bad guy"" type story where they were trying to outdo themselves by doing something really evil. It just didn't pay off at all."|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in both the 19th century and early 20th. I have just returned from the BFI film festival in London, which I've been to with my son once before last. As usual, I did not get to spend a whole day with all of the wonderful films being shown, but there were very few that struck me as particularly bad.The only one that really kept me awake for longer than 2 hours was 'Vampire Smile'.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an elderly couple in a home invasion, I don't know but this was my least favorite installment in the series. I bought this movie mainly because I had heard that it was ""good"" and that it was being remastered. Well, what can I say? How bad can it be? The plot is so awful and unbelievable, that I found myself laughing hysterically out loud at the end. Not only that, but every time I tried to laugh, I would go completely limp."|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking all over and i haven't seen it here or there . This film has had its ups and downs. It was really good for the 90 minutes in which it appeared on television. But it did get so bad in the last few minutes, when it became even worse. As an example, if you don't understand what is going on, then you can't watch it.If you want to understand the plot of this film, then be prepared to have your mind blown!|0
"Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the early 19th century (and still very present). If I were a black man living at the time, my first reaction would be ""Why would anyone want to watch this crap?"". Why even bother? In all honesty, there was absolutely no redeeming value. The actors did not act on any level beyond what they were paid to do. All of them were as bad as it gets."|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Thing is when they all go missing she goes into the woods to look for them.When she does she meets a guy who takes her back home.There is a little bit of nudity though I think it is a little overdone, I thought it might be a little too close to some of the earlier movies in this series.The movie is kind of sad and dark but I thought it would be funny so that is probably why it made it. This movie was pretty good.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's. The director (James Dean) was able to convince a decent cast of well-known characters to play parts they would never have fit into the original version of the story. My first ever horror movie! It starts out with a small town being threatened by an alien spaceship. There are lots of stories about what's going on, but there isn't enough info for the audience to really believe in them all.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a lot of great acting skills but he can't quite match the film's other star, Charlie Sheen. Sheen's performance is pretty good but it just doesn't get near as much credit as Busey's. What kind of movie would this be called if it wasn't such an awful waste of time and money? I feel bad for anyone who thought it was going to be one of the most original and entertaining films ever made.|0
"I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 when she got the part. The director thought she should show off more. He even went to great lengths to change her dress so that it wouldn't look too ""cutesy"". After seeing this movie, I am left disappointed. The actors were not gifted enough for my taste. As an avid reader, I would expect better acting and dialog. There are no real twists or revelations. This movie fails to make any sense."|0
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us back in time to 1872, the year that Martin Luther King was assassinated. One of the funniest things about this film is that its premise consists entirely of racial stereotypes. It's one of those movies which are so stupid and bad that they have to be made. The only funny part is when some African-Americans insult an elderly white guy.The script is just awful. There are no clever lines here and it gets boring very quickly.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys have no reason to be on this island , there is no sense of mystery , why do they keep visiting the island ? I'm still trying to sort through all the awfulness of this movie. There's really nothing wrong with it except for the lack of a coherent plot. This is one of those movies that has no beginning or end. You either watch it, or you won't see anything good happen in the whole thing.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only gets two minutes on IMDB. When you do watch the movie, be sure you know who the actors and actresses are based on their voices and body language. This is one of the most boring, low-class, over-acting films I've ever seen. It's just so awful! I like to see movies from different eras. Usually I find myself in a movie theater where my parents are watching Star Wars. However, some of these movies have aged much more badly than others.|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face while watching it because i cannot imagine how someone could hate it so much. This film was the worst thing I've seen in years. The acting was terrible. The plot was weak. There wasn't a moment where anything made sense, and yet the story was more stupid than funny. Even the script was awful. I really felt for the characters. It was just such a slap in the face that you almost want to punch somebody in the face.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
"To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . If I didn't know him as an actor and a human being, I'd still be thinking ""I don't believe this could possibly happen!"" The film was not worth watching. First of all, it looks like it was made by someone who did not care about making good films. The acting was abysmal; one would have expected more from a bad script written by someone who has never worked on a serious project or done a scene with a bunch of people before."|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you are looking for a good thriller then definitely watch this movie. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and i'm not making that claim lightly. What an absolute disaster! Not only was the story so awful, the acting was as bad, or worse, than the script. The two leads were so pathetic, the only reason why I kept watching until the end was my curiosity to see how far they had fallen.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is my second all time favorite show and its even better on DVD so you can find the episodes in a single sitting without having to rewind and watch them again. My only regret is that there aren't more original stories in this show. The main characters are great but don't get me started on the storyline. This is probably the WORST cartoon ever made. You could go to any amusement park and see people running around jumping out of their cars, shooting at each other, breaking things, etc.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian expats. I thought it had good potential and enjoyed seeing the film, but as soon as the credits rolled I decided to walk out of the theater.The problem is that the plot doesn't make any sense. In fact, the film goes out of its way to do the opposite of what it's trying to accomplish. What makes it all the worse is that the cast are just awful. The whole thing was terrible.|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of Hollywood types were going on a vacation, and this made them even more excited when they came back to town. When they got back, there was no longer any movie theatres in Los Angeles, but everyone went to their home movies which were rented at the movie theaters. They didn't just rent them; they watched them all the time with other friends. The only problem was that these movies didn't have a lot of funny lines either.|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
"This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but the plot isn't really connected to the show. When I first heard about the film I thought it must be some kind of ""bad"" rip-off and was disappointed because it was just not bad. Instead, I found it to have a few moments that made it memorable, but nothing that set it apart from others out there. This is probably the worst thing ever to be made in Hollywood, and this is no exception."|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at the end it turned out OK, but not really. The only thing of interest in this movie is that they filmed it in New York. They filmed it right next to Madison Square Garden! This film is just so bad, I don't know why you're still watching it. My friends and I went to an after party a couple of weeks ago and we sat around trying to decide on which movie we wanted to watch together.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , it looks like an earlier version of the same type of movie that was made about three decades later.I would have to say it is a total waste of my time to even try to find something positive about this film. For anyone who's never seen it, here it is: It's probably the single most tedious and stupid piece of trash ever made. The only reason I bought it was because I wanted to see it, not because I thought it was entertaining.|0
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for the firm, which has just been destroyed and its new owners are going to run it for them. After watching the video I couldn't wait for this movie to show up in theaters so I could rent it and see how bad it was. The first thing I noticed was the horrible acting. If you are familiar with Wes Craven's zombie movies you may know that he makes his zombies come across as more intelligent then the average person does.|0
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing that the girl was on her period, but we got it right and were disappointed with the film. The plot was very weak and did not add anything to the movie. I'm gonna say this right off the bat: this is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. At first, it's funny. Then it becomes annoying. Then it begins to feel like a waste of time.|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The film consists of a group of men who have been forced to live together for a few months before they decide to join forces. This is a really good piece of work. In terms of plot and characters, it can't get any better than that. There isn't enough to keep the viewer interested, and there were times when the story just didn't make any sense. It was hard to like this film even with all its problems (I'll admit that some people will love it).|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! It may sound cheesy, but that isn't the reason why I didn't see this movie. For me this was the worst movie I had ever seen. There are too many scenes where the director seems to have no clue of what's going on and doesn't want to give an answer. The acting is good and it has some nice special effects, but if you like watching movies where the villain goes around doing bad things, or just plain weird stuff then you will definitely dislike this movie.|0
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not worth watching. It certainly isn't for everyone, but it is certainly worth the effort.The story is about an American woman who goes missing on her way back from a holiday in Portugal and turns up dead at a country resort after having been stabbed by her lover in revenge for his bad treatment of her. When I watched this movie last night I had a feeling that the director was trying so hard to make me laugh, that he didn't succeed.|0
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that's supposed to have been stolen by a group of drug smugglers. When his father gets involved in the smuggling plot, it turns out to be the same group as the one that originally stole the ship. I don't think that this movie had any merit; if there was something about it that was enjoyable, it was more than likely that it was because you enjoyed the fact that the characters and the situations were very much made-up.|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the original but its still worth seeing.The plot is simple: a serial killer makes an innocent girl pregnant. The killer kills his victim after her father refuses to pay child support and takes away her son. I'm just going to start this off by saying that I never thought that Chucky would ever be a big enough hit to become a movie. I always pictured him as more of a bad TV show villain, or perhaps a slasher movie villain.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on His Deathbed ), this is one of those films that doesn't fit into any genre. The movie is a black and white suspense horror picture with a very interesting premise. I was intrigued by this documentary when I first heard it, as I felt like I had just seen something really special but didn't quite get the whole picture yet. This is exactly what happens to us when we spend too much time trying to understand ""what's"" going on while watching so-called reality tv shows."|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect from this movie. The premise sounds good - a man wakes up out of a deep sleep in a strange town, goes off and has a fight with a monster, but all I got was some generic monster-fighting action! It's hard to describe this film as anything more than a cheesy 80s sci-fi/horror flick. You've got an old guy in his forties who thinks he's being chased by a bunch of evil goons on a small spacecraft.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series. I felt it was one of the best programs on television to date, and would not hesitate to watch it again if someone ever asked me to. I am now a huge fan of Dr. Who , which is my second favorite show. It's a pity this show has such a bad reputation--it is actually a great show. The only reason it hasn't made the list already is that there isn't really any other serious sci-fi or horror fare out there these days.|0
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I laughed out loud. The actors were funny but the script was not funny. Beware, it may be one of your worst movies. It is about an ex-cop who takes his daughter to a secluded beach in the Caribbean where she meets two men while he is away. One of these men wants to make a deal with the girl that will guarantee his freedom for the next 30 years. In exchange, he will allow her to live in his home.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . The picture looks great , the acting is good but the writing is so bad, you can barely understand a word in most of the dialogs.The story starts out promisingly and with a decent cast of actors. They get to play a couple of cops who discover something very strange about their town when they go there to do some investigating. This movie is just plain bad! It's hard to put words to why this movie is such a joke.|0
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series finale.The show had a lot of potential if it would have been directed properly but it was a complete farce. They should have put together a pilot episode and called it a day. When I saw this movie on DVD yesterday, I was surprised that no one said anything about it at the preview. Then I went to the video section and saw that someone had listed the movie as being in theaters. I guess that must mean it has gotten better over the years, although I don't think it did.|0
"All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull man looked like his head was on the chopping block. I've seen this movie three times now but have yet to find out what happens to it. First time I saw it, I actually thought it was a complete ripoff of ""Karate Kid."" This one just doesn't give me that same sort of fun. It's not as bad as ""Fist of Fury,"" but it's not as good either. There isn't a lot going on in this one."|0
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary is a very bad director. So i did not have much expectation about this movie. Well, I'll admit it - I'm a big fan of The Man with the Iron Fists (the TV series). A good story is all well and good, but a great movie should have more than just the story. That's exactly what happens in The Man with The Iron Fists, where the entire action consists of nothing but the action scene.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you like to enjoy a good laugh , this wo n't be for you . I thought this was going to be a comedy, but it turns out that the plot isn't even real. I think this is all about some of the worst acting talent i have ever seen in a movie. The story is completely unbelievable. Every single character makes absolutely no sense. One of the main characters keeps asking ""What did you do to her?"""|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree 100% with some of what others have said, it's terrible. I also think it was a bad decision to leave out one of the best films of the 80's in favor of this mediocre effort. It is very much worth seeing, however, if you are looking for something different than your local thrash/doom/whatever band. What a complete waste of film. At first, it looked pretty decent, but after the opening sequence, it became obvious that it was all going to be wasted.|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the original, which was filmed from an upstairs window. The new version of this classic is pretty much the same story (which isn't hard to believe) but there's one major thing that doesn't really change. You can still hear that muffled voice of William Shatner in the background. When it's over, he'll be at your feet with his hands around your throat and trying to beg you to let him out.|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to learn what went on inside the brain of a man with an IQ of over 200. Kahn, who has been working closely with Dr. Charles W. Freeman for the past five decades, began by interviewing Mr. Kahn's family members as well as people he knows personally. I had heard of this film through my wife and I were excited when we decided to see it together. The cast list was very strong and one of the most exciting parts of the movie was watching the performances of all the actresses.|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. He did not show any love for the German soldiers, he went one step further and showed his hatred for the Japanese. You would think that the man with more than 30 years of experience in filmmaking would know better how to take a good story and move it forward...but this was a failure of a film. My daughter saw this at my local movie house, and she wanted to watch it too!|0
"Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than mindless ""chaos"". In the end, I think you can make your own mind up.In a time when people were just beginning to understand how human nature is built, this film was a classic in its own right. There are some good points but there are also plenty of things that are completely stupid and out of touch with modern life.I'm not sure why I gave it a one because I could have found better films."|0
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now Chucky 4 sucks and it's a waste of time . They need to make the sequel even better. This is a bad movie . Okay, maybe this isn't one of my favorites but it was one of the most entertaining I have ever seen in awhile. A lot of movies today seem to be so formulaic they could be played with a tape-recorder (which would be pretty funny). I think this movie has more originalness and interesting ideas than any of the recent horror flicks I've seen.|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
"The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay film. The story could have been a lot better, the performances could have been more natural and there was a really boring ending. But hey, that's what you get for watching a child's movie ! My friend and I came across this movie while looking to find a ""family"" movie. We had watched many horror films and found ourselves intrigued. So we rented it without hesitation.We didn't understand the title at first."|0
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It would have made for some good tv shows , and if they get picked, I think it will be a great story . The contestants are all really nice and smart , but there are just too many weak contestants . For the most part this movie had me intrigued. My initial expectation was that it would be an extremely interesting action flick. While I was pleasantly surprised by the overall feel of the movie, I did have a feeling that the filmmakers had something in mind other than simply making a fun film.|0
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I mean what in the world was that movie? I really have to ask myself, 'what was the point?' Why do we watch horror movies ? We like them because they tell us a scary story, and sometimes it gets good scares. I want to start off by saying all of the above review is based on an actual purchase of the DVD...and yes, that does make the film much less enjoyable for those who would rather watch TV.|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who the lead character was and what his story was. In retrospect, I now realize it was one of the greatest movies ever made (even more so today). It's a real treat to see the entire cast perform on stage and watch them in front of such a large crowd. It's difficult to say exactly what to make of this movie, especially as it's so much a product of its time.|0
"1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murders of rival gangsters. A few months later one of them and his brother are arrested for the murder of a fellow crook and shot in the back. The most disappointing film I had seen this year. The acting is very bad, there is no suspense and none of the ""chills"", the script is not even funny. This film was made in the 1950's, it would have been funny if it could have come up with something interesting to say."|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
"This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this one. I will admit that I didn't like it at the time, though I must say that I still think it is an OK movie. There was one or two nice moments for sure, and I always thought there was something missing in it. I watched this film after being recommended by someone who had heard about it on a British TV show. While I found some good bits in the film, it was nowhere near the greatness of ""E.T."""|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Peretti ) who is about to go out for a date when she gets a call from her boyfriend asking her to come back at night. When she comes back she finds that he has killed another woman. Now what can she do? This movie came out of nowhere. And it was not even good. This film was terrible. It had too many pointless scenes and bad acting. It didn't have any interesting plot but it had all the other ingredients you want in a crappy movie.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere, in one of his most memorable roles, plays the lead. He doesn't really come off as a leading man, but he certainly does give it a good shot. Okay, here's what I can think:1. This film was bad for a few reasons. The main one being the fact that the actors playing the role did an absolutely awful job of it. At times they were so bad at their work that you just couldn't take it anymore.2.The characters in this film are not believable.|0
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very suspenseful and I kept hoping for the ending to be a surprise ! I could not believe what I just watched ! The end was such a disappointment and I did not understand WHY anyone would want to watch something like this !! The story is terrible, the acting is poor, the special effects are amateurish, the directing is horrible, the production value is pitiful, the dialogues are stupid and stilted. You see all that, but don't know why anybody would ever want to watch such a thing.|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
"This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to watch in a car (I was sitting there for about 15 mins). The music is amazing and the director does his job perfectly. The plot is not very clever, but is executed well.The only problem I have with the picture is the ""darker"" lighting. I remember this movie as one of the better ones of the 1990s. Now, I really can't see why anyone would choose such a film; it wasn't really good at all."|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man and his son whose lives are turned upside down when they are taken by a mysterious cult in the Colorado Rockies. The story itself is excellent (well, it's good if you're a fan of weird films) as well as the music.The only problem was the dialog. I don't see how anyone could watch this movie with an open mind and actually expect to understand everything that goes on! This movie had some interesting scenes but the overall story was pretty unbelievable.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrifically funny characters; this movie does not disappoint. When I saw this movie I had high hopes--but it fell short on every level.First off, there was absolutely no suspense. The plot was so predictable I felt as if I'd just been told it was going to be a big action flick. What's even more disturbing about this is that my expectations seemed to go out the window when the film ended. No one left any questions after the movie was over.|0
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber is singing it at every party I go to. I've got no complaints with this, but there's nothing even remotely funny about it. I have been hearing about this album from various other fans over the past few weeks, so I decided to put in a quick review of it. I'm a huge music fan and have always appreciated songs by some of my favourite artists, so I was hoping for something special.|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter was in trouble with his parents. So they sent him to a boarding school where he would become the world's most popular child entertainer. The opening scene of this movie was pretty dull. It showed us the protagonist (who I can only assume is Buddy Holly) sitting around talking to himself. Of course, this could have been a nice introduction to some of Holly's more unusual lyrics but it didn't go anywhere.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully entertaining little play that, like many plays of its type, gives the audience what they expect to find. The play itself is very good so I can understand why it was shown here and there as part of the general theater program. However, I have only had the opportunity to see this one in New York City, and from what I've read, it doesn't seem to be performing anywhere else yet.|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I have always been very disappointed with his movies. This one was so bad that I almost fell out of my chair at the screen . There were so many things that went wrong here . For one, there was a lot of wasted time during the final scene where Billy is forced to shoot himself. It felt like an extra scene was added just to make him feel more alive. Secondly , this movie had so many pointless characters and scenes that they seemed to be cut from the movie .|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them. I am sorry to disappoint my friends, but this is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my entire life. This is just a complete waste of a good film and i will not be spending any more time watching it. The main reason I decided to write this short review is because I was very interested to see how this bad movie would be treated in a cinema. In other words, whether it would be accepted as a movie, or viewed as a piece of rubbish.|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
"But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and many more were brilliant. I have no words to describe this film. ""Rising Tide"" does exactly what it is supposed to do. The plot is interesting enough and the action (and some of the editing) is pretty good, but the acting was mediocre. Some of the lines were just not that funny. In fact, there are a few lines that made me laugh out loud. But when the film really gets going, most of the humor is gone."|0
"For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , and/or literature and have a strong appreciation for all things '80s and '90s, you really should sit down for this movie. The script is terrible and even the actors' performances are sub-par. To put it simply, I could not care less. There are 2 problems with this movie. 1) One of the most popular bands in rock history was made into a bunch of ""bouncy"" dorks, and 2) these kids just don't get it."|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
"Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like that, does not add anything. He doesn't even have a plot. There are some interesting things about this film. First, many of its elements fit perfectly into real life. In fact, one of the reasons I had to watch this movie was to see if it was true. I found myself having to pause several times and think: ""Hey, this actually happened?"" And then finally I laughed out loud."|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! I am not sure if it's my favorite film of the year, but I loved this one. It has no stars, but you will be happy to know that the script is solid and well acted. This movie is based on an Italian novel written in 1787 by Francesco Saverio Rava. I read it in the 1960s when it was published by Edizioni (Italian publishing house). There are some plot elements that do not make any sense.|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of life on Earth. If you are an avid fan of the space operas like Star Trek, Babylon 5 or even The Next Generation then this will be exactly what you've been looking for. I don't know who directed this, as it was written and directed by a different team, but I have to say that there is a huge disconnect between the tone of the story and the actual events that were portrayed in real life.|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
"I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available on DVD anywhere in my local video store . I was so close to getting it. The worst thing about ""Masters of Sex"" is that it doesn't make sense. There's no reason for Dr. Peter Lorre to be married at all, especially after what he did when he was hired to help with sex therapy. That being said, it's still kind of a great movie if you've never seen it before because it has many great scenes which are worth seeing."|0
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this movie. I just started watching this, and honestly I did not give it much of a chance. Not in the least due to the low budget and lack of production values. The actors are all so bad that I cannot even believe that there are people who thought that they could act convincingly with those terrible voices. There were some good scenes (mostly), but the majority of the movie felt like something someone on a college campus would watch on a rainy day while trying to stay awake.|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is yet another classic example. The plot is simple enough, the story is a bit silly (it doesn't really seem to care what happens) but the acting was superb. Even though the book is based on an early stage play, this movie didn't give me that same feeling as it would if I went to the theatre to see one of those old stage plays written by Shakespeare.The cast is fantastic in this movie.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a cross country treasure hunt. So, this movie had been in the works for what seemed like forever. I loved the script, I loved the actors, and I thought the direction was very good. What I didn't like was that it came out in 2007. It was almost twenty years ago, and things are much different. So many of my friends were dying of cancer, and when I first heard about this film I just laughed.|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
"Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience leads to him being unable to speak English. He has no idea what to do with his life. It is hard to think of anything better to end a mediocre film than an emotionally-dubious plot that tries to make you believe in a story, instead of showing you how weak the movie is. This is where ""Orient Express"" falls flat. We are told nothing about its meaning. We are not told what these people are after, why they came to America, why it is so terrible, etc."|0
"This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew on a search for the Orb, and it has lots of wonderful moments which make up for the lack of interesting ideas. This is a must see because of its superb special effects and excellent performances. If you liked the original ""Star Trek"" you probably will like this one as well but be ready to give up about half an hour. The plotline is pretty weak and lacks any significant twists and turns. In fact it is almost entirely predictable."|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . I don't even know who this movie is based off, but I can't stand it. I have to give credit where credit is due, there was a nice plotline that didn't seem to gel and the acting was awful. There were two main characters in this movie, both of which seemed so out of place and unlikable.The most egregious thing about this movie was the fact that almost all of the dialogue was completely made up, and nothing ever happened.|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is trying to say. It's a shame that i can't even find the movie at my local library anymore. I've heard it's great, i'd go and see it for sure. A lot of people tell me this movie is the worst they've ever seen, and I'll believe it when I see it. The acting was poor. The story was boring and predictable. The production value was lousy.|0
"I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video reviews and other stuff. But, as a whole, ""The X Factor"" is a total farce. This is one of the shows worst moments. I had to take my wife and son away from the set for an entire week. One of the cast members even left the set with me in the car and that was the last I heard of her. There is absolutely NO reason to sit through such a pathetic show."|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot, while not particularly deep, is well-executed to a degree. There are some scenes in the first few minutes or so that have me giggling as I watch it, but overall the story was a bit boring and predictable. The characters were mostly forgettable and didn't seem like they'd make a good addition to an animated movie. A group of friends go out for a night of drinking, when one of the guys decides to try his hand at acting.|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best part of this year's Christmas specials. And I've never been a huge fan of sitcoms. But they do have an advantage in that there is always some levity in the midst of tragedy, and the way this movie works is simply brilliant.The storyline revolves around three young friends who get together for Christmas dinner. One of them, Charlie (Jason Bateman), wants nothing to do with the other two. They don't appreciate his lack of decorum, he's too busy making jokes.|0
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
"First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about her. This movie has nothing good to say about its main character and that makes it one of the worst, as far as ""pulp"" is concerned. What kind of people write a movie about a teenage girl whose only ambition is to have a successful career in modeling after her mother? Not only does she fail, but she eventually gets caught up with the gangsters who murdered her mother. That was the most boring thing I have ever seen!"|0
"The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . The characters are all quite likable , even if they have a hard time acting themselves. I bought this DVD because of the poster and box art that included the cast and crew. That was about the only reason I picked it up. Sadly, that was about all I got.The film takes place on a moon called ""Eos"". It's an abandoned world where people live underground under the moon's surface."|0
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` All About the Boogie Man !? I don't like either one. It is hard to think of any good TV series from this period, even though it started in the 1940's. But I must admit that I love all these movies, they are just plain boring. The only reason I still watch a movie when I am bored is to see something else. This was not the case with 'Dead Man' , I actually had high expectations for this movie.|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
"A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great supporting actors , lots of humor, and some suspenseful action scenes . Not sure why this is one of my all time favorites , but it IS! One word: disappointing. I was expecting to be in love with a film like ""The Secret Garden"" or ""House of Sand and Fog"". Instead, I found myself frustrated by the slow pace and unappealing characters of the film.I could not understand why someone would choose to invest so much money and effort in making a low budget film."|0
Dr. Paul Flanner ( Richard Gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son is killed in a motorcycle accident and then he meets a new woman, the mysterious Dr. Elizabeth Parke ( Susan Sarandon ), and they move into an old mansion on the estate of a wealthy family . This movie was awful. I mean terrible. The acting was horrendous. It was like watching someone try to read my mind by speaking slowly and making me look stupid. And it was so poorly filmed that I could have done better at trying to find out what happened.|0
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him from behind , and he dies instantly . The film started off looking promising on paper. The story was intriguing enough, the cinematography could have been much better, and the acting was great. However, by the end of the film it had lost all its promise, and turned into one of the most boring and poorly directed films I've ever seen. The only reason I watch horror films is to find out what goes on in them.|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Cardellini and Christopher Lloyd . The story centers around a couple whose marriage ends in divorce (in the latter half of the movie), and their efforts to rekindle their relationship. It's a very heart-wrenching story about two people who have been estranged for most of their adult lives. It is not that I blame the director/producer/star, Robert De Niro - if he truly loved this film he wouldn't be trying to put it back on DVD!|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well.The plot isn't interesting enough to warrant any more detail. The character's motivations and their relation to the story is not clear either. The action scenes are so simple that I was expecting something more complicated. It doesn't help that there is little to no background or background setting. This film was directed by a director known for his work on the B movies, as well as other lesser-known indie flicks.|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness "". Now, as far as my knowledge is concerned, it was a good movie.The story does contain some interesting historical and philosophical elements, although they were not developed enough to warrant the attention that they had to be. The acting, on the other hand, was superb. It would have been nice if this movie had been better. It was supposed to be about a military officer trying to make a new life for himself in England (in this case an army unit) after his wife leaves him."|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
"Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge monster they make, this movie could have been just as good without it's great art. This is one bad movie that should never be made. If you don't like zombies, watch ""Dawn of the Dead"". You'll find out very quickly that they're far worse (in fact, I've even seen two or three movies that had zombies that were worse) and the same goes for other genre movies too.The story is pretty dull and uninteresting but the acting isn't that bad either."|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in and out of each other, not to mention the fact that it doesn't always go exactly how one would like.I'm not too sure if this would be a great movie to rent or watch for the family, however, because I am pretty sure the film is terrible. It's hard to recommend this movie after watching the trailers. Not only was the story way off, but the character designs were really ugly!|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps you going from beginning to end. This was the only time we had seen this in the cinema. It's easy to get lost in all of these scenes, but the main thing to keep track of here is that there are so many things happening that you feel like you don't know where to go next. You're walking along, and you see something on the horizon, and you wonder where it could have gone.|0
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers, especially among those who don't share the same tastes and values. Some of the characters in this movie seem like they have no idea what it's all about. I can't see why anyone would take a trip to Las Vegas or Atlantic City where such a movie could be filmed. I love this movie. This is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot is very simple; a black man goes to his white girlfriend's house looking for money.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to it in order to keep them from getting sick. It's really a pity that the director did this. I would have liked him to go on for several minutes and do some research into the background of the real story, because there is so much good stuff about this movie. The story is based on an actual incident in the United States. Somebody said this was the worst movie he'd ever seen--and he's not wrong.|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
"The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original show , but no matter how bad the music is it can't compare to this. I mean, what else can be said about this crap except that it's terrible! I'm surprised that anyone in their right mind would watch this kind of ""entertainment"" any more. The acting was not funny or entertaining. This movie is the worst thing I've seen in my life. It's so bad you won't even believe what's in it."|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight Yoakam did a good job in his performance, but we didn't get to see all of the characters. We were treated to less than three hours of the film, and I would like to know how much screen time went into each character. If you're planning to do a road trip from San Diego to New York City, you might want to put this film on the list of movies you plan to skip!|0
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book over the years, many interesting things have come about. I must say that the book has a good ending but it has so many problems that it is not believable. I don't know if you can blame me for being disappointed, but i had just gotten a chance to see the movie in theatres. I was expecting a good movie, but it turned out rather poorly. It is hard to explain how bad it is.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in the process. It's impossible to fully comprehend the depth of grief after losing your brother and, even worse, is it possible to reconcile your desire to protect him from harm?is a compelling look at human nature in the face of tragic loss.It's hard to imagine that you'd ever truly be so torn between such a profound sense of attachment to a loved one and the overwhelming need to protect him. And yet, I'm actually quite interested in seeing how the film deals with these difficult subjects.|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. He plays a ""good guy"", but not one of the hero types, so he does not come off as too good. I just finished this DVD and it's awful. Not to say that it's bad, I'm sure most people who have seen it would be able to spot a few good moments. But there seems to be no direction in the film, or an intent to get the audience involved."|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and suffering that has been inflicted on the American psyche since the end of WW2.It's not perfect, it does fall short of the high standards set by most films of its time but still remains entertaining to this day. I have no idea why anyone would think otherwise. I just watched this movie today. The plot was awful. It felt like the writer or producers had already read the script in advance and decided what they wanted to say before they ever showed it.The characters were dull, one of them especially so.|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched it with my daughter, who was in her 5th grade class. The only bad thing about this movie is the ending. We had no clue what was going on in the last 10 minutes. I felt sorry for the main character because she wasn't supposed to be there at all. Her name was Elisa, but we never learned her final name. There are so many missing people throughout the story that you can tell that someone was really missing.|0
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an actual movie but its got to be the greatest thing ever put into one. I would give this movie 100 stars and i'd even consider making it into a full blown reality TV program. Just watch this movie you can't imagine how many scenes you missed out on. The fact that these scenes are actually in a movie is pure genius. I am a complete skeptic. I was skeptical because of all the reviews.|0
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , and I really want to watch it again ! The only problem i have is that the music is very repetitive. There are some scenes where you can see the same music playing all the way through the whole movie, so it can't help but take up too much time. One thing that bugged me during my viewing of this was that the director did not talk at all during his interview. I think he could've been more involved in the film if he'd done so.|0
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite some poor acting . The story was bad , and I am sorry to say that they had to do this. But I like the ""original"" film and if they would have given me a few scenes from it i might have liked it more.The characters were not so great, and they are really annoying at times. This is one of those movies that will make you go out and buy a DVD set of your favorite movies just to watch them."|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the realist. It was an incredibly entertaining film, however it was not as well thought out as others are making it out to be. At the time of this writing, the film has garnered 3.5 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. This means that approximately 4% of the critics who have seen this film have decided that it is one of those films that need to be given a 4 star rating just because it can be made funnier than the majority of movies.|0
This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters under the title 'The Great Train Robbery'. One thing I found extremely odd about this movie is that on the DVD commentary, it claims to take place in New York. Why would they change the location so dramatically? And why not have some shots of the Statue of Liberty from the same time period? There's no explanation whatsoever as to why they switched Manhattan from New York to Detroit. It would have made a far more believable film.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most people could still believe that the Cold War was actually a war between superpowers. In fact, many in the press and some politicians still seem to think that this is at least part of the story. Even if you disagree with his conclusions or want him to be proven wrong, he has been right about many other topics as well.The world is a complicated place, and we are all going through our own trials and tribulations.|0
"What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , Joanne Froggatt , David Hyde Pierce , Robert Wagner , Jane Russell , James Brolin, Christopher Plummer, Roger Moore , Donald Pleasance , Richard Dreyfuss , Jean Dujardin , Martin Sheen
The best part of this episode are the people who appear on the screen. I didn't think that anyone was going to want to see them all together but they sure did. They looked good in their clothes (I thought they were really cute) and acted well."|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen before and just try to figure out what the story was about. We even thought it was some kind of sci-fi satire! It ended up getting really stupid. The movie was like watching two guys go at each other in a boxing ring. I mean, seriously. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I didn't come here looking for ""the best"" movie this world has to offer, but I can say with confidence that this movie is not even good."|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . The film was shot in a single day , and there are some really nice camera moves. It may be possible for me to give it 3 stars, because it has potential, but still, this movie has no real story. It could be interesting to see what happens when humans become sentient (if you're going to put human beings in robots, you would think it'd be at least a bit interesting to see if they got along well), but otherwise, nothing special.|0
"SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must say, I do not like how it has been handled over the years by Fox... It was a great comedy series for a long time, but now we are being treated to a lot of trashy garbage. For anyone who loves the original ""The Simpsons"" series, this film is very well worth your time. For some reason, I've never gotten the slightest sense that it was made by anybody other than the original show's creator, Dan Greaney."|0
"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . Not me. It had a good plot and interesting characters. However the only thing that kept my interest was the female lead. I didn't go to this movie as a fan of science fiction. I just found myself drawn to it in general. After reading the reviews, I thought ""this will be fun"". Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared to sit through such an overlong film.There was no tension at all. The writing was incoherent. The dialogue was not funny."|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and saw a movie called 'Viva La Bam' on MTV. I was really disappointed that this movie failed to bring about any excitement for me. I wasn't too enthused watching this movie because of how it seemed to try its hardest to be interesting, even if it did have a very basic plot and was very predictable from what I could tell from the previews. After watching this movie I went to my local video rental shop and picked it up .|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there is not a good story to be found. I do not understand why people give it a 5-star rating unless of course they are too young to get it or have no clue about the meaning and value of films. Most people just sit there and wait for the plot to unfold and that never happens. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because there was at least one decent bit of humor. You know the type.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if the acting was decent, as most of it is , but not for this film. It has no charm and no heart. I have seen so many positive reviews about this film that I took a risk and watched it hoping for the best. The movie starts off pretty good with an interesting plot, characters, set-up, etc...but then it slowly turns into a mess. Every single action character seems to have some sort of hidden flaw that will eventually lead to him getting in over his head.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed in a way that makes it entertaining, which is an impressive feat. For the first half of the movie, we follow the exploits of a British officer who travels abroad to investigate a strange series of attacks by aliens. After he learns more about their origins he goes off to save the world.I found the plot interesting enough, though it did feel a little contrived. That's all I'll say for it.|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
"I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade in to this form . Don't get me wrong there are plenty of good Sci-Fi movies out there I just wish they were remade . I can't believe how well this movie has held on to the audience's attention for three hours. There is a reason this movie is one of the ""Most Wanted"" on IMDb! What an interesting way to make money, even though the plot lines are pretty lame and uninteresting at times."|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain and the dust on the floor give Chaplin a sense of hopelessness that he seems to have. WTF?! What is wrong with this film?? I don't get it!! It is as if they tried so hard to be funny but it all goes down the drain after a certain point.The acting is horrible. The script is terrible. You can't really make up your mind about who the main characters are from one second to the next (they are all dead by then).|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make the film better , but on the whole, it is ok . This movie is bad. I think the director tried to do a good story, but just couldn't finish it. The actors are all very flat. They didn't have chemistry together and they were all very tired when they appeared in this movie. You can tell that the writer made this movie to be a horror movie, which I understand, but it doesn't work at all.|0
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the whole plot was a bit silly to begin with (but then, you can never really tell what was and what wasn't in a sci-fi flick). Well, there are a few good scenes in this film, but for the most part, it fails to add anything to the rest of the franchise. You will still remember the events of the previous movie , but if you watch this one, it's probably not going to come as a surprise.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (even by the standards of Hollywood films from the 1970's) that can't be denied. One character in particular stands out to me as a very flawed and interesting human being. This character is played by Robert Redford . There are some good things in this movie but there are also some bad ones too.The characters, if you're not familiar with them, are all flawed, but none of them are perfect.|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a home after the death of his mother, who was forced to move out of her apartment in order for Bartleby to be able to stay at her side. This film is so terrible that I almost gave it away on DVD when I saw it at my local Blockbuster with an R-rating. When I came to review it I found that there was a warning on the front of the video that if you watch it even one more time it will get your family killed.|0
"Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or human interest whatsoever. In fact, I am surprised to find out that there is still a market for this filth on Youtube! It makes me think of all those horror movies I saw back in the 1980s where the only good thing to say about a movie was its ""spooky"" feeling (that's the closest I can get to the term in this case!). What a waste of one of cinema's biggest and most iconic names."|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. The only saving grace in my opinion is that most of us are old enough to remember the original . It is hard to think that someone would go out and make another one of these cheap rip-offs but I am sure there is still some money to be made! This movie should have gone over better, it could have turned into something good.The story line is very generic and the acting was poor.|0
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a man who is murdered and then finds out what really happened that led to his murder. His wife is trying to solve the case but is in fact involved in it herself. There is a great deal of hype around this film, and while it may be the best horror film of the decade, it certainly has a few problems. The plot is confusing and the story seems to be all over the map. I can't recall ever having seen any of the movie before I watched it.|0
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 6 is a pretty bad movie in comparison. It might be the worst movie ever. Death Wish 2 is so disappointing because I loved it and now I wonder what happened to make it such a disappointment. Why did there have to be so many plot threads and not enough time spent on the characters? All I can think of is that the producers got tired of making movies with lots of plots but little time to spend on the characters and they decided to make two very different movies.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the usual plot lines and characters as well as providing plenty of funny dialogue to help make it funnier than it could have been. When I saw this movie at a theater, I was impressed. The opening credits (which were so beautiful) really set the stage for what was to happen later in the film. Unfortunately, this movie is one of the very few that I can think of that does not live up to these expectations.|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . In fact, it was so good that it earned a nomination for best picture. The movie tells the story of a bunch of kids who crash into the Bermuda Triangle only to find themselves being hunted by the inhabitants of this mysterious island. As I watched it, my head started to spin with all kinds of weird ideas. I got this as a gift in the late 90's. It has been a part of my TV library ever since.|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone-poem that deserves its reputation as one of the best film noir pictures of all time. There is a sense of tension and confusion in every scene, but it also feels lighthearted and easygoing. If you're looking for a true crime masterpiece, with a truly original twist, this movie may not be it. I'm going to try to be fair and objective here, since there have been plenty of great true crime movies.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's version. And this film is a masterpiece of cinema, not only on the artistic level, but also on the quality of acting, direction and cinematography. This is truly one of those rare moments when the director himself has an impact upon the viewer. This film will make you want to drink more water in your stomach. If you've tried any of the snowqueens, you know they are great actresses!|0
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , but it failed at making us want to go to see it . I had no interest in watching this. I didn't even know there was such an option. My boyfriend and I rented it because we thought it would be fun to have a laugh with our friends on the couch together.We weren't disappointed. For one thing, I could not get the joke out of my head. There were so many times I wanted to throw up.|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar shows up out of nowhere and takes them all down. The Princess Bride (1982) has been on my watch-list for a while now, and I had to see it first hand. I was quite interested in seeing how the story would end.I was surprised when I saw how long it was. When I was younger, movies were short films, usually less than 20 minutes. In this film, you get 2 hours and 45 minutes.|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' He was not the only star who didn't shine in this classic comedy, with Paul Newman, Jane Curtin, Robert Vaughn, Walter Matthau, Mandy Patinkin, and Gene Hackman also doing their thing. I don't know how you can even begin to put into words how badly this movie did. I first heard of this movie on the radio. I thought it was just a joke. Then when I saw it on the screen I laughed.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values are absolutely superb. This is a brilliant piece of British filmmaking and I have seen much, much better. For those who are familiar with this film, you may think that there might be some issues with plot, character and pacing. However, it is so incredibly well made, I found myself unable to take my eyes off it for hours.The story starts out innocently enough. A young man goes on an adventure across Europe in search of his missing wife.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just a waste of time . This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I bought it from the DVD shop but it didn't play in my home computer and I couldn't find what it was. When I went to look at the internet I found something about it and it had been made by an Italian company called Mondo. Anyway, I can't get over how bad this film was. There were so many scenes where the characters looked as if they had not slept for days.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
"Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch on stage. That is all you get out of this ""movie."" I saw this film in the theater and, while enjoying it, thought that there had to be something really wrong with my brain chemistry. It was just plain wrong. First of all, the actors are horrible. They don't even bother to look like real actors. The acting is so weak that they have to use props for their lines."|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
"My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was really sweet in her performance, but unfortunately the plot is just a load of b-s
Why did they make this such a crappy movie? It's one of the most boring films ever made. I mean, it has some good scenes at the beginning but there's not much to do. There's no story, no character development and the only reason why I like it is because it gave me a bad case of the popcorn syndrome."|0
"This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have to be taken out. The other has a past history of stealing from bank accounts. Why did I keep watching this movie and not come across something better? I don't know. It wasn't too long ago that I was going through a phase of watching all the best Sci-Fi movies, especially the ones with Tom Cruise in them. After seeing ""The Bourne Identity"", I was thinking, ""Well, how bad can it be? ""."|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a sequel. This time around, we're not just following our intrepid detective (Ben Foster), but we're also following his wife (Gloria Reuben) as she takes to the streets looking for him. I've never really been much of a fan of Ben Foster films. Not because I don't love him as a performer, but because there were always some parts that I thought he failed to deliver.|0
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and their activities, and it makes for an entertaining watch. Unfortunately, the film I saw on this particular night was not one of them. The movie had some plot points that could have been interesting in theory, but in the execution they were just completely out-of-the-ordinary, with no relevance to anything the characters actually did. First of all, despite what the filmmakers tried to tell us, we didn't really know who these two guys were.|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie jumps around a lot.The plot is fairly well set out, and while it did get a little boring after an hour or so, there's enough excitement to keep things interesting (which is all that matters).The characters are pretty good - I actually liked most of them. As a huge fan of Stephen King, it was disappointing to find myself disappointed when he decided to use one of his favorite characters as the antagonist.|0
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I got it and was blown away. It has some of the best scenes in all the Star Wars movies, and is the best Star Wars movie to have ever been made by Lucasfilm. Well, how can I say good things about a movie if I don't have enough positive stuff to go on with? After watching this one, I came to that same conclusion: This is a movie which should NEVER be allowed to be seen by any person over the age of 18.|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
"As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like ""A Few Good Men,"" make you feel. This one does not.I wish I could take away one thing from this film, because I don't see how it deserves the negative reviews. It's all too easy to read into these reviews, and I think that's a shame. A few words of wisdom: 1. There are many better films out there! 2. If you can find them, watch them. 3. Never judge a film by its cover."|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments I have seen on film.The cast of characters are good but there is not enough depth to really feel like you're watching someone's life. I recently watched 'Deepwater Horizon'. It was a must see; I saw it again just to confirm that I had made the correct choice. The production values, editing, story, acting, direction were all superb. I thought I could trust my eyes, but they weren't too reliable.I found myself agreeing with every single aspect of each and every character.|0
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang was a bit too slow to catch the imagination and i found many scenes where i wanted to see more action but it took too long to see what was happening. There are no bad moments in this film , just a lot of things that were done right . You could say that this might be a good movie for a couple of friends or an evening with a friend/ sibling but if you want to watch something longer than 20 minutes , this isn't it .|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this film during my time in Ireland. I spent a few weeks there in the 80's and even went on a couple of summer holidays there. My wife and I would always end up at the local cinema for the family-friendly movies. Very bad, but I do not think it can be described as anything else than an absolute disaster. It starts off fine enough, with the main character (Jack) traveling to the U.S.A. from Mexico.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town and he has his hands on some girls . I bought a DVD from Amazon for $3.00 after reading the reviews of people who watched it and liked it, so I had to get it. The first half of the film was interesting. It looked like a decent thriller but then the second half went downhill from there. I've seen too much gore films to have any interest in what happens to these two main characters.|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better , the plot was really good and I enjoyed the acting . This movie could be a great film if not for the horrible acting and script. If you're an action movie fan, or a fan of kung fu films, this movie might be for you, but I don't think so. The characters were poorly written and they lacked any kind of humor.I found it difficult to relate to these characters because they had no real lives outside their roles.|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but also humor and a few surprises. The film opens with the mother (Natalie Portman, who did not win the Oscar for her role) coming home to discover her husband (Michael Fassbender) being brutally raped by an unknown man (Ben Kingsley) while she is away at work. To make matters even more complicated, her son (Ricky Gervais) has been left in the care of his father (Paul Giamatti), who does not return his phone calls.|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
"So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that will make you cry? You know the type I'm talking about. Well this one has done just that, and it's hard to find words to describe the level of emotions I experienced during its runtime. The acting was fantastic, but the worst part is that this movie is just too sad to be enjoyable. Some people have seen ""The Notebook"" already, so you can't go wrong if you want to see a more mature version of that story."|0
"It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful journey that will be remembered as one of the most important movie of the 20th century. The only problem with it being a ""horror"" movie? It's not even really a horror film, because there is very little gore in it (aside from a bunch of corpses)
I had seen many horror films over the years, but I didn't really like any of them. In fact, I would probably say that some of these films were actually kind of boring."|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. It is not clear at the time of writing this piece that it is a remake of any of the many earlier films featuring the same star. However, the similarities between the first three films are striking. If you have seen all of the previous movies in the series, please go and see this one. You will love it. First of all, I had expected a good old fashioned horror movie from this guy. And to be perfectly frank, I was wrong!|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from plot point to plot point. Even after a dozen or so such scenes, it never gets going. The scriptwriter could have done something like this much more interesting, even if the idea was not new. My wife gave me two copies of this DVD for my 50th birthday and I bought it for Christmas. I don't know what's wrong with me but I didn't want to watch it until I read the synopsis that accompanied it.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
"What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of those ""what's it like"" type of shows... which is quite a good description of the show! If you have been following the movie and book series, you must be able to tell by now that this is the weakest of the lot. If you've been reading the books or seen the video games, you'd know what I mean. The acting is all over the place. There is too much going on, and nothing feels right."|0
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the job done. He is forced to live in an apartment with a wife and kids. I like Chaplin, but I had no interest in this film. I think it's more than obvious that the writer(s) of this were not very well versed in the finer points of making a comedy. I have never heard anybody say they are a comedian, unless they have taken classes or something. And even then only after they've had a couple glasses of wine.|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
